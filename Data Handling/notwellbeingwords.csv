would
wrong
totally
depends
tools
shouldnt
use
method
early
game
without
enchantments
mining
netherrack
would
take
ages
different
enchanted
pickaxe
mining
right
enchantments
could
give
ancient

ph
enchantments
definitely
want
pickaxe
unbreaking
iii
mending
efficiency
ii
higher
first
two
need
one
pickaxe
reason
need

level
ii
break
netherrack
instantly
like

v
pickaxe
still
higher
better
especially
need

lower
chances
get
big
lava
falls
dig
one
long
tunnel
long
