session my therapists give me such lifechanging advice today she met mentioned how I might be scared of being friends with people for too long because of how they might see me they might know my flaws how I might need to open up for me I never even realized that cuz I'm always like I want to be friends with people long term and it's still true but maybe subconsciously I'm scared of them seeing my flaws my therapist was saying how like long-term friendships usually there is something that you don't like about the other person it is probably not like a big thing they're not exactly a clone of yourself there's going to be some differences because of that that makes a friendship very valuable despite the flaws you still love them of course like you know there are certain deal Breakers and that's for you to decide okay okay girlies so girlies what did we think of the Vlog via how are you feeling right now very good question I'm very happy you asked it is currently Thursday June 6th 9:33 p.m. I actually just came back from a solo walk so it was nice to take myself on a little walk I haven't done that in a while and I forget how nice that is and I am feeling better now I am feeling more motivated now I just have to force myself to do it to be okay doing it and I think like maybe I just ate something wrong in the past 2 weeks something happened and I just I just spiral I'm just like oh my God everything's going to suck again like I said before at the very beginning of the video the goal of these videos when I make them is to prove to myself emotions are like this okay there's the lows and there's the highs and yeah and I just need to keep telling myself that things are temporary and honestly these days I think I've gotten better at navigating these awful well actually you know what no because when the emotions suck at that moment it really sucks like it just feels like you can never get out of it but I hope to really just get to the point where it's like like even if I'm at an alltime low I can tell myself that hey hey this is just temporary you're going to get up there again you're going to feel better just because it's bad doesn't mean it's not going to be good like you just got to give it like you know a week or two and here I am and of course during a week or two you need to try at least getting yourself out there if any of you guys are going through something similar like I am um I hope that video helps you everything's temporary okay everything is especially your emotions like you're feeling very bad it's going to get better but you have to also put in the actions of trying to make yourself feel better I'm generally grateful that um I felt better today and I'm happy I'm back into making like these little little tiny Boston Vlogs because I kind of miss doing those and I feel you guys miss it too just be in the comfort of my own home,"recovering from a depressive episode ☁️ deep cleaning room, facing my anxiety and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSvMhNjatWs,Marysia," You are not a machine. You are more like a garden. You need different things on different days. A little sun today, a little less water tomorrow. You have a fallow and fruitful season. It is not a design flaw. It is wiser than perpetual stainless. What does your garden need today? Everything could be going well lately. Maybe you have been consistent with your goals. You have been doing all in school or you have been keeping up with the fitness. But one morning, afternoon or evening, that feeling inevitably comes again. Or maybe there was something that reminded you of a bad past event and brought up old feelings of sadness and anxiety. Sometimes it even feels like whenever you feel genuinely happy, something bad is bound to happen. Maybe something occurred that didn't go how you think it would or didn't go as planned. In your job, relationships or school, and it seems like all the progress you've made has dissipated or doesn't have any meaning. Your logical brain knows it's not true. But no matter what, the emotions can take over and lead you in a very dark place. And I think here we go again. Honestly, this happened to me recently and I know I'm not the only one who goes through this. But I'm not going to let myself be sucked into a dark hole. So I picked up my camera so you can join me on a few days of trying to feel better. I'm not going to let myself be sucked into a dark hole. But I'm not going to let myself be sucked into a dark hole. I have a spoon inside my head. Life can be tumultuous, excited, confused, or disorderly. However, calm and stable someone's life appears, a closer look will reveal up and down. They're all part of the human experience. I like to sometimes imagine the ups and downs of life like a heartbeat. If it was a straight line, then our life would be over, like one on a heart monitor. I've accepted the inevitability of this, but thinking about the downs when you're on the peak really takes away from the moment of happiness. I struggle a lot with thinking about the what-ifs, so much that it spoils the very happiness in front of me. I just finished with practice and was kind of sad because it was the last practice of time. At the same time, since I've been aware of this phenomenon, I can use it to my advantage and see it the other way around to motivate myself through a challenging period. At a low point, I know that there will be an up sooner or later, and it's inevitable too. I've come over a bit, I love it, it's so easy. I can't do it, come on, I'm gonna have to see you start now. Take me home. Go down the road when you feel so indigenous. 1. Find things to look forward to. Sometimes when I enter a dark place, it seems like the future can be really hopeless. Events out of your control like the impossible cost of living or environmental concerns can bring me down a lot. The accomplishments that I do have seem so meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Therefore, I try to look closer, at smaller, even more superficial things to get through my life day by day. Every Sunday, a new episode of my favorite show releases. And recently, I've been looking forward to journaling every night to release my creativity and my thoughts. Some other things could be sports games or something small you're saving up to buy. I know people say to live life in the present, and that works sometimes, but during particularly stressful moments in time, it can be more beneficial to have something to look forward to. This is Amlant's Atherapist, Lanaya Smith Crawford. I'm sorry I just cried. I'm going to make my bed. I'm always telling myself I'm a boring person and I don't like spontaneity. I like routine and order and being comfortable, but sometimes I think that's just something I've been telling myself to avoid going out of my comfort zone. I've had myself going day after day doing the same things and of course that's going to be boring after a while. It feels like I'm just going through the motions of everyday life, but not truly living. So this time, I threw out the planner and I decided to take a spontaneous trip just to my best friend in different city and also visit my parents because I haven't seen them in months. The excitement and spontaneity was so refreshing because it was rare that I didn't plan in advance. I felt more relaxed, more flexible and doing different things made me feel like I wasn't missing out on moments of joy for once. And I'm not the only one who feels this way. 72% of people said they feel happier after they act spontaneously in some way according to a study conducted by one poll. So maybe it's time to veto the schedule for once. So I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way.","try to feel better with me :) ♡ healing morning routine & habits, recover from a depressive episode",17.04.2022,Rebecca Jay,Woman,Early 20s,8:47,8,"0,9982"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baGAlh2Q5vM,Wentao,one of the biggest paradigm shifts that I have made about happiness is that it's not something that we feel it's actually something that we do it's a skill a muscle that all of us can strengthen and improve and to help you do that I've created this really simple five-minute happier workout that you can do wherever you are without having to change your life go away to meditate for a year having to you know cleanse your soul or organize everything perfectly you can do it right now in fact along with me so here are the five steps the first practice is acceptance and it's the practice of being with your feeling and with yourself just how you are not having to change negative into positive not having to shift or struggle but just how you are and to do it you simply spend two minutes being still and silent if you're comfortable please close your eyes but you don't have to we don't spend a lot of time in our life just being still and being quiet and so two minutes of stillness and silence is a great way to help you connect a little bit closer to how my feeling it's kind of like your chicken and then to practice just being there accepting of how you feel the second practice is gratitude now an overwhelming amount of research studies showed that when we practice gratitude our brains release dopamine and serotonin both of which make us feel really really good and the more regularly we practice the easier it is for our brain to do this on its own so when you practice gratitude as part of your happier workout I ask that you do two things first is you have to capture your gratitude in some way so maybe jot down on a piece of paper one or two things that you really appreciate about your life you can also say it to someone else you can share with another person something you're grateful for but you have to capture them the second piece is the more specific you can be about what you appreciate the better so think less I'm really grateful that I'm alive and more I'm really grateful that this morning I got to enjoy my favorite cup of coffee undisturbed for a couple minutes the third practice is what I call intentional kindness now we all know that it feels really really good to do something nice towards other people but in this practice you're actually focusing on your intention you're doing something by focusing all your intention I'm just doing something kind now to do something right now maybe it's something that is really simple you send a text to a friend and you check in and see how you're they're doing it's amazing what a tiny act of kindness like that can do to the recipient you know we live in these lives we're really busy we're running around it feels really good for someone to check in on us it feels really good to be seen if you can't do something kind right now as part of your happier workout put it on your calendar to do later it might seem strange to schedule kindness but I actually think it's really important we schedule meetings we schedule errands why not schedule kindness so as you're a third step and you're happier work out either do something intentionally kind or schedule it for later today your fourth practice of your happier workout is call it what I call the bigger why and the bigger why is connecting to a sense of meaning in our lives now often we think of meaning as something you know out there like we have to go out and find our life purpose but what I found is the best place to look for meaning is within our lives so what I'd like you to do is think about some of the things on your to-do list it could be something you're doing for work or something you're doing for your family or for a friend and now consider how that one task helps someone other than yourself you know maybe your project at work is helping your colleagues or customers maybe one of your errands today is to get groceries and the way it's helping your families that you're gonna make a nice dinner with it later when we connect to a sense of meaning we not only feel happier but research shows it actually makes it easier for us to get through the money to do this on our list the fifth practice in your happier workout is self-care now many of us have challenges with practicing self-care and self compassion because we feel like we don't have enough time or we feel like if we beat ourselves up or if we talk to ourselves harshly somehow we'll be more motivated to do better and to improve and in fact research has found the opposite research has found that when we treat ourselves with kindness and compassion with the same kindness and compassion that we usually reserved for people we love we're actually more likely to get things done or more likely to improve we're more motivated to do all of the things that we want to do so it's part of your happier workouts spend a minute saying a couple of supportive things to yourself it could be something as simple as hey I know you're gonna have a rough day today I'm just reminding you that you're okay and we'll get through it or it can be something where you express gratitude to yourself for yourself find something that you appreciate about yourself and say it to yourself as part of the self-care practice of your workout and finally when you're done with your five steps of acceptance gratitude intentional kindness the bigger why and self-care take a moment to just thank yourself for taking these five minutes out of your busy day to do something that is not just scientifically proven to improve your well-being but also will contribute to your productivity your creativity research has shown happier people have better relationships at both at work and at home and also consider the fact that by cultivating these practices through the simple workout in yourself you're helping people in your life experience some of that happiness as well because research shows that happiness is contagious so when you do this happier workout it doesn't just cultivate your own happier skills but it can be the beginning it can be the star at the inspiration for people in your life to cultivate theirs [Music] you ,Simple Habits to Be Happier in 5 Minutes | Nataly Kogan,29.03.2018,Nataly Kogan,Woman,40s,06:09,7,"0,9999"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4XZ3cppqIw,Wentao,"Hi there, i'm Laura from Twinkl. You can use this music for well-being activity  with your class or even at home. Listening to music can have very powerful  psychological effects for your well-being. It can help calm the mind, energize the body  and even help to reduce stress. To begin sit down together and listen to a piece of music.  It could be someone's favorite song or a new piece of music you have not heard before. This  might be a good opportunity to expose children to a genre they might feel less familiar with.  As you listen encourage everyone to think about what they imagine whilst hearing the music  it might help for listeners to close their eyes at this point in time.Once the piece of music has ended ask each person to complete one of the sheets  it's a good idea to wait until the end of the piece to begin writing or drawing  as thoughts might change as the music continues. Sheet 1 asks you to draw a picture to illustrate  what you imagine then write about how the music makes you feel. Whereas sheet2 also asks you  to give a reason for your answer and rate the piece of music giving a reason for your score.  Everyone can choose which sheet they would rather complete or they can do both however sheet one may  be more accessible for younger children as they can draw their ideas and give a simple  description. Once everyone has completed their work take it in turns to share your  ideas with each other. Did anyone have any similar thoughts or were they very different enjoy taking  part in this discussion and encourage children to use musical vocabulary. If you need some  support with this check out our elements of music explainer which goes over some musical terminology  in more detail. Feel free to repeat the activity again and again, perhaps choosing a different  style or genre of music each time. Well that's all from me today, i really hope that you and  your children enjoy listening and sharing music together. Until next time!

of posting that I have not been doing well this is nothing new I've been through this before with you and explained why it's usually because I go through a depressive episode um and I feel like I had a chat about this not too long ago too like a couple months ago because I just didn't post for like a few weeks and then I posted a video I was like Hey I was not been doing well so yeah that's right and we're back at it again and I literally just like hate doing this not for the fact that I have to do it because I don't I get really supportive comments all the time and like you guys are so so nice and just so supportive but you know every once in a while I'll get a comment it's like girl you always do this like you always just like disappear or you always just not post and it's like yeah I know it's it's eating me alive I know but the thing is I post about my life and when you're not really living life or not really feeling like living life it's kind of hard to post anything and I want to talk about just outside the context of posting because this is not an explanation but it's not an excuse video I literally just want to talk about what I've just been struggling with uh because again I like to post about my life and I just want someone else who may be experience experiencing this to feel less alone because I feel so alone right now so yeah again it goes without saying that I pretty much have just not been feeling great mentally a main factor of it is that the frequency where I'm having the depressive episodes just keeps getting greater and it just feels like every other month now I'm just like in a month-long depressive episode and it's not a fun way to live and I feel like I'm always like oh that last one was bad and then another one comes along and it's literally worse because I feel like it's again just like built up emotions of just being frustrated that I have to go through this again so it's like the actual depression on top of just anger and frustration and I've just I've literally been doing and feeling nothing for the past couple weeks and like emotionally again you react to that so the fact that I'm not doing anything and not feeling anything or feeling terrible just again makes me more upset and angry so that's just this continuous loop of negative emotions and it's just not great I feel like I'm gonna ramble a lot I hope anything I say just like makes sense okay me so you go down there but yeah to describe my life currently it's kind of just nothing I I've been struggling most with just feeling absolutely no passion or spark for anything in life which is not fun and no matter how hard I try to force myself to get up and just do something just just do anything every day my brain is screaming at me just go do something something doesn't matter what it is I just I can't I cannot get my body up I cannot get my brain to cooperate I no matter how much I'm screaming internally get up do something go live I can't and you know the longer that goes on the harder it is it gets to like do something and it just makes me even more sad on top of my sadness because I'm sad that I just feel like I'm wasting my life no matter how hard I'm trying to not do that but it makes it so difficult because I know subconsciously that anytime I do start something or I try to implement something new or have a good time it's just gonna be followed up by another depressive episode like it's hard not to recognize the patterns even though I don't want to believe them I want to believe that there's you know a chance that it'll never happen again it most likely will I know it's like fall down seven times get up eight but what about if you've fallen down like a thousand times you get pretty [ __ ] tired and you don't want to ride the bike anymore but I mean I keep trying and that's what everyone just asked me just like oh keep keep pushing through keep going I really have to keep going tattooed on me and it's like I am and I will I'm just [ __ ] tired I'm tired of feeling like a prisoner to my own brain and body and I currently just feel like like I said I just have no passion or spark for anything because I'm so tired and burnt out and it just feels like every day I don't know what I'm like getting up for and I don't want to feel that way like that's a scary thought to me I don't want to feel that way I want to wake up and want to live my life because we literally only get one of them and I want to make the most of everything and I've had time periods where that's happened so I know I'm capable of it so it makes it even more frustrating to know that I am capable I just for some reason cannot do it right now like there's only been like maybe two solid periods of my life where I felt like I was literally like cured of my depression and then of course it came back both times and that just makes it very discouraging and I remember that person I'm like that just feels like completely different that doesn't feel like me that feels like an alternate reality where that just wasn't me like how do I get back to that person so again I just have this like lost sense of identity I don't know who I am I don't know what I'm doing I don't know what I'm getting up for I don't know I don't know anything I don't know anything I don't know how to move forward because every time I move forward I fall back again one step forward two steps back like it's every time I just I never want this to come off as just like complaining and excuses and yeah whatever poor pity reads like I never want to do that I I'm I'm fighting hard every day I'm allowed to be tired and allowed to be exhausted and that's something I try to tell myself even though I hate it you know I I just as much beat myself up for it that I'm going through this but I try to have some sort of compassion for myself that's like a lot of this is out of my control and I'm doing as much as I possibly can to control it so again I never want this to come off as just like a pity party I'm just explaining how I'm feeling you know and I also always feel a lot of like shame and embarrassment around kind of the privilege of being allowed to be depressed because I do work from home and this is my job but I also want to explain like if I don't post I'm not making money like it is directly affecting my income thankfully I'm kind of good with my money so I do have some saved up but I'm not rich by any means like I'm gonna need to work I need to post and I want to post more than anything like again it's never a need like YouTube and stuff is at least was my passion and it still is I'm still trying to like get back to it and find it I'm not like Rich by any means or like sitting on a pile of money where I can just do nothing all day like I still need to pay my bills and stuff and every day my bank account is dwindling that's just like another stress that's on me because I just I just always feel anytime I'm talking about being depressed and not doing anything where again I'm literally not doing anything not posting even though it's my job I don't want it to think it's some privilege to take where I'm just like an influencer that can do whatever they want and just making lots of money and doesn't care about her audience or her content that's not it at all I want the spark back for this so bad every day I'm like man I want to film a video but I'm not even getting up and doing anything or living my life so there's nothing to film plus I'm and just depressed and I have no self-confidence or esteem and I don't obviously want to like get on camera and post when I'm in a bad mood because that would be terrible content you know I I like to post uplifting stuff so yeah it's it's not like that at all and that's why I make these type of videos where I'm kind of like explaining because I'm just I'm just human struggling that just happens to make YouTube videos I would still be experiencing this whether or not this was my job that was kind of a different rant I don't I I hope that's taken well I it's just everything I say I hope it's again taken well and just a conversation between us I don't know I get kind of nervous because these are very nuanced topics um you know that feeling in your chest when you can't take a deep breath all the way in like if you've been like swimming all day or in the ocean and you've just been holding your breath all day so like by the end of the day you can't like take a deep breath I just I feel like that all the time I can't take a deep breath I can't relax I just feel frustrated just the main word I can ever come up with is frustrated frustrated with myself for not being able to do enough to fix this frustrated that I'm doing so much and none of it's working frustrated that I have to deal with this in the first place frustrated that there's people that have it way worse than me and I'm complaining just frustrated all around about everything um but again I try to be nice to myself I try to be compassionate it's hard though when I just constantly feel like I'm failing myself and just wasting my life and not living up to any of my expectations just constantly disappointing myself because that's another thing [ __ ] I don't want to cry that's another thing with the whole content creation thing I want I have have one of this and want this so bad I'm so inspired by other creators and I'm just like I want to live that life and I know I could do it I know I could like put out content every day and like I know I'm good at doing this it's just this [ __ ] depression and mental illness gets in the way every time and I'm like if I was not this mentally ill I would be able to live out my passion and really make it work for me and really just I don't want riches or fame I just want to be able to do what I love which is like making videos and pictures and talking about things I care about and feeling again like I'm living life and just every day I don't make content and I'm not following my passion and what I want I just I'm so disappointed in myself I'm so disappointed and again this would apply to any anything I was doing no matter what my career was or my passion was like it would apply to anything I just I can't get myself to do anything I feel completely out of control of my body and my emotions and my brain I don't really know what else to say I didn't really don't cry it has been really really tough for me recently and I hate it and again the hate adds on to the continuous cycle of bad feelings so I'm trying not to but it's hard when I just constantly feel like my life is put on hold and I'm just wasting it so sorry for this depressing ass conversation unfortunately that's just how it would be right now and there's really no outtake or something I can end this positively on I don't know I would like to end it positively like I am trying I'm really I'm really trying I just recently went to the psychiatrist and I'm trying out a new medication so we'll see if that works um I was told I have treatment resistant depression so that's really fun so again I'm telling you guys I've literally tried every single category of antidepressants I've tried this will be my fifth one in my lifetime and they all have stopped working and it's literally just treatment resistance so I'm like oh my God like no matter how hard I try it's just not gonna work it's always relieving to get a diagnosis but it's also like what the [ __ ] do I do with this now uh what do I do with this information treatment resistant but whenever I'm trying a new medication so we'll see if it does any anything different yeah I don't know I'm open to literally trying anything but I don't I don't really know how to end this it's so this conversation is so depressing and I hate feeling like I'm complaining but uh I'm just gonna say thank you if you've watched this at all especially to the end because I know people don't really like to watch talking videos I don't I don't have the attention span for that thank you if you watch any of my videos ever and have ever supported me or ever left a nice comment or a like on a video like that is what I live for unfortunately my brain is just disconnected from that right now and I'm trying to get back into it anytime I get support from anyone every single view every single comment I read I look at and it just it's just a really great feeling um and that's all thanks to you guys so I'm trying I'm trying to come back we'll see what happens so yeah okay bye,living with depression is

https://youtu.be/eIXCIZo_qlo?si=axcw3s3MQhisJMXN,Marysia,your happiness is not a destination happiness does not have to be big sometimes things are just simple life is short but at the same time it's very long you have to do something you enjoy as something is very short because you only live once happiness can be in seconds why can't I smile more I'm always like someday someday someday instead you should change your mindset into one day can you see me is the lighting bad why do I feel look so weird should fix my hair I can't tell anyways hi everyone welcome back to my channel yeah so exciting anyways anyways okay so for this video this is something that I need all of you guys to hear this is something that I think it's very very simple when you grow up in a certain environment you just don't seem to get it and that is just the fact that you can be happy every single day happiness can be achieved every single day you are allowed to be happy every single [Music] [Music] day [Music] [Music] you know what's really funny I only realized this recently like I fully understood the concept that I can be happy every single day just recently that's kind of messed up when you're a kid you have this sort of idea of Happiness as in this is a destination once I reach this destination I'm going to be happy but that's not true I went through it I was very focused on academics if I get into college that's going to be my happiness all my problems are going to be solved I can tell you right now no because once you get into college you are still living I did feel like when I got into college a lot of the stress I had was kind of gone but you're still going to have problems you might even realize a lot of the deeper problems that you might have not realized because you were so focused on your academics and for me that was like mental healthwise I wasn't really looking into some of the the traumatic um I didn't didn't really want to face it you know once one of the things your worries is gone there's something else to worry about based off of my 22 years of living all I can tell you is that your happiness is not a destination happiness does not have to be big if it is great but I think you have happy seconds at least to happy minutes happy minutes leads to happy hours happy hours leads to Happy Days Happy Days leads to happy months and happy months leads to healthy years okay that's my mentality you don't have to feel happy all the time don't feel like oh I'm not feeling happy now I'm wasting my life no I'm just saying that you are are allowed to feel happy I'm not allowed to feel happy I haven't reached my goal I can't I can't I can't feel happy happiness is not a grand thing you go out you take a walk ah the air is nice I love this temperature my favorite type of weather is Autumn hence I'm really happy right now chilly sunny weather in the low 60s like those are my favorite type of weather oh I want to try this new bakery store I'm going to go to this new bakery store I'm wearing my favorite shoes I'm wearing a pretty outfit I like my makeup today I like my hair today I'm starting a really good book oh I am so proud of myself for going to the gym today these are just some of the examples that make me happy and they're not especially Grand and they honestly they don't have to be being happy is very important because what's dominia like like then there's so much to see out in the world right sometimes things are just simple and I know like I can understand that in certain period of times in certain environment life can be really hard I had a phase where it's just in I was in a bad environment I was not in the right place I was with the bad people and it was it was hard to be happy personally for me Independence brings me happiness can mean all sorts of things I was like 18 16 you know I didn't realize how short and how long life is life is short but at the same time it's very long you have to do something you enjoy as something is very short because you only live once as a kid you listen to the adults you're like oh they want me to do the they want me to do that you need to make sure you like it I personally would like to believe that hard work pays off it may take a lot of time right your feelings may not always depend on external college application season or you're working a very stressful job and you have a big project coming up that doesn't mean that you can't feel happiness at that moment of course is stressful if something makes you happy embrace it the truth is you can be be happy every single day and the reason why that is possible is because happiness does not have to be something Grand you do not have to be promoted to CEO right you don't have to be a billionaire or a millionaire you don't need to be that to be happy okay oh I had a good hangout today or oh I tried a new ice cream flavor and I really liked it that's happiness there you did it you achieved happiness oh if there's bad moments then I don't achieve happiness no happiness can be in second you can have seconds of happiness every single day you can have I don't know a few minutes of happiness that's no happiness I think you need to notice more things sometimes just being more aware of your surroundings you go out you look into nature like ah the leaves are changing colors ah the sun is looking great sometimes life is simple sometimes life is complicated life can be really complicated we're all humans we're all very complicated we all have separate layers but sometimes I do believe that when things are simpler sometimes it's nice sometimes when your happiness is in simple terms I think it's great I feel happy when I see nature okay then you go out in nature and you feel happier I think happiness should be the journey because once you've reach the destination that can only last a brief moment right after that moment then what emotions are always temporary right bad emotions good emotions they're all temporary so when you reach your destination and you're happy that's temporary that's why it's very important for you to realize that your everyday life you can be happy cuz sometimes you know you wake up and you have a feeling of dread and you're like tomorrow's going to be here again I woke up this morning today is going to be awful but who said so why is today going to be awful why can't today be great why can't today be your day why can't every day be your day it's not self it's not selfish to want to be happy every day I realized these days I think that one of the key to happiness these days is for me to be a little more Shameless and you might be like what do you mean by that at least for me I don't really see a lot of people doing this like when they're just walking alone they're smiling for themselves and I'm like I should smile more why can't I smile more who the is going to punch me if I smile like the like I'm going to walk out the door I'm going to smile like I'm not talking to anyone on the phone I'm not listening to music but guess what I'm still going to smile because why in the can't I smile you can go out and you can smile because V said so V said you can smile so go smile go outside and smile like a idiot because who gives a you don't know if a nice compliment would really just change someone's life or changes someone's day right sometimes if I see like a girl wearing a pretty skirt I'll be oh I really like your skirt I don't need to compliment back it just makes me happy to compliment someone right it's just doing something nice you know you don't have to tell anyone about it but I think doing something nice daily can be a good thing and another thing that I think is important to know is that your happiness should not depend on other people I mean of course like you having friends and stuff is nice but sometimes you need to know that you can create own happiness just by yourself you can take yourself on a date you can take yourself to your favorite bakery store you can take yourself on a walk okay I enjoy having good company but I do realize that a lot of the time when I am by myself I take in moments better if I'm in like a quiet Garden I can just sit there because sometimes I just like standing in places and just taking it and I'll just be looking I oh that's really pretty I can just stand at for a very long time and I I do feel like making this video is sad in some ways I do feel bad for my younger self she genuinely just was going about life quickly as in she wants to get there as fast as possible as in the life that she was living at that time was not worth living which I think back to where I'm like okay she was in a very sucky place I just wish you could have enjoyed the journey a little bit and see things in a different perspective I'll be happy at the destination but sometimes you need to realize or something that I needed to realize back then was that I had a lot of mental issues there was a lot of internal conflict that needed to be fixed yes going into a different environment helped but not all the situations were solved because I didn't face myself I didn't face my internal issues I want to become something else I want to become X I'm jealous of this I'm jealous of that why are you jealous of that why aren't you working towards your goal what is stopping you from doing that that's why you feel so much you feel like oh I'm not happy right now because you're not working towards the things you want cuz I'm not taking the first step I'm always like someday someday someday instead you should change your mindset into one day this day I am going to do this I'm going to start this day instead of one day someday someday I'm going to do that someday if you keep saying that you're never going to do it the first step that you take it does not have to be perfect it can be taking the first step matters okay that is the hardest part the next hardest part is to keep taking the steps the steps that you take you can be it can be okay it can be really really bad but you don't fail if you keep going you do not fail you only fail if you give up going even when you suck ass is hard cuz think about it when you're going you can keep going but you're you're succeeding every single time you're going that's easy everyone can do that right because you're succeeding but when you go and keep going and you know at the at back of your head I'm like this might not go good but you still decide to okay you know what it's not going to go go but I'm still going to do it okay I'm going to learn something from this I have to keep going I have to suck it up and keep going you know every single time you're like I'm anxious as hell this is going to suck like oh my God I cannot do this every single time I being a disappointment to myself but you're still going and going you're going to reach it and I hope you reach it because you deserve it something that I think is very cliche that everyone says but back then I did not understand is that you deserve happiness and the reason I didn't really understand is because everyone says it you deserve happiness how do you know I deserve happiness you're a human being let's think of it like this why do you think that you don't deserve happiness I think as a human being we deserve happiness it shouldn't be conditional why do you want to live life suffering right life is short this might sound morbid to you guys but death is going to be coming for all of us someday our time on planet Earth is limited death will get us someday okay let that s into your brain nobody escapes time nobody does we're all going to die someday I'm sorry if this I burst your bubble so while we're at it why don't we enjoy life I think that's just part of Being Human you know we know we're all going to die so we're all going to to enjoy life you need to live life like it's your own because at the end it is your own life you're not living for someone else and sometimes it's hard to come to the conclusion of that especially for those of us who grew up you know you want to please your parents you want to please your relatives you want to please other people you want to please your friends right okay I pleased you I pleased you and then what like what the is going to happen I live the rest of my life trying to please you that's exhausting who the am I then why can't I live my life especially when adults expect you to act a certain way I'm like you don't deserve to have a kid I'm sorry you don't because if you expect your kid to act a certain way and you don't expect them to Chase your own dreams and be their own person you should not have been a parent your kid wants to achieve something else so you as the guardian as to parent whatever the you are you should allow that because that is your responsibility when you decide to have a child or you wanted to take on the responsibility of taking care of that child that is your number one responsibility you need to let your kid be themselves they have their own version of happiness that they want to achieve which might be different from yours right I personally love the boring life I get comments where people are like wow your life is so boring good I I'm a boring person and I like boring suit me I like finding happiness and mundane things I like finding Beauty in boring mundane I like things simple I like things slow that makes me happy that's me I like boring that might not be you it's fine it's okay we all like different things what I'm trying to get at is that everyone's definition of happiness is different but that doesn't mean that if your definition of happiness is different that is not happiness anymore it is still happiness so what I want you guys to get from this video is just the fact that I want you to be happy you know and sometimes it takes a long time to realize this and look at me took me 22 years to realize this type of that should be so simple right to understand if I was a kid and I watched this video hopefully I would change my mind and be like yeah I can be happy right now like a lot of times like happiness depends on a certain point of your life maybe you need to have certain things fulfilled right now me I'm a lot happier than I was back then but because I'm older I get access to a lot more things compared to when I was younger Maybe it could also just be to therapy or due to other external factors happiness is not easily achieved in some ways because sometimes the obstacles that's blocking us from happiness is internal and it takes time heal from it forgive to accept to move on it takes time and I'm not saying that it's going to be quick but I'm saying that you are allowed to be happy so yeah I really genely do hope that this video helps some of you guys I want life to be easier for you guys and I hope this message really speaks to some of you guys if a cup of ice cream makes you happy that's good that's good that's good when you realize tiny things can make you happy I think you can live a very happy life that's it for this week's video I hope that this video genuinely helps some of you guys because this is something that I only realized recently really wanted you guys see the same perspective as me because I feel like when I realize this I just feel like things are just so much more

https://youtu.be/H_Qzdzd5l_U?si=0GyhHxxaF11wJOOy,Marysia,"I just got back from a trip to La I've been traveling a lot lately and while it's been fun I'm very happy to be home while I was there I met up with a new Creator friend Megan Tan in person for the first time ever it was such an adventure and I think we had an even better time than we thought we would today I want to talk about the one mindset shift that completely changed my 20s for the past several years I've had this personal motto that goes say yes now figure it out later I've talked about it once on here before and it is a motto that I hold very close to my heart and has been responsible for many events in my life it's my little tattoo on my wrist and I cannot believe it's already been 2 years since I got this thing that's crazy a lot has changed since then and I always find it very interesting to revisit themes at different phases in my life and see if it's still relevant if things have changed or if it's reinforced and for this in particular there have been a few things that have reminded me of it when I had first come up with the phrase figure it out later it was after I had dropped out of college and was slowly finding my way in the world I had an idea of what I wanted to do but I wasn't great at putting myself out there I cared way too much about what people thought I was way too in my head about some things and I struggled to really find my voice and throughout this time figur it out was my anchor it was a way of reminding myself to just make a decision and I will figure it out when I get there sort of having this trust in yourself while taking these leaps of faith and periodically it will pop in and out of my life I think we inherently know when we connect with the idea of something it feels exciting and terrifying all at once but before we even have the chance to pursue it we often hold ourselves back because we don't know how it will turn out when Megan asked me to go on a trip to the West Coast there was a moment where I felt hesitant to go it had been a while since I've done anything like that we had only just begun to know each other and I was considering saying no but you never know what an opportunity will lead to and you never know how impactful something will be till after you've done it there could be a million different things that could make it the wrong choice but you only need a few good reasons for it to be right when it comes to these giant leaps of Faith quitting your job taking the trip meeting someone for the first time it always leads back to this four-letter word risk beautiful outside there was a period of my life where I was feeling very stagnant I wasn't meeting new people or experiencing new things but I was also not putting myself out there at the same time it's so easy to be comfortable in your but I think it's also important not to take it too far and it's not about saying yes to everything but it's important to know when something will be a healthy push it can be intimidating to open yourself up to show the world who you are and not know how it's going to be received this place but we're never going to know what's on the other side unless we're willing to take that first step and see where that tells us where to go next the beauty of putting yourself out there is that it also forces you to be adapted and creative in ways you may have not expected C it opens you up to seeing things in a different way learning from different people and maybe even finding things you weren't even looking for there will always be some level of risk involved when it comes to doing something completely out of the ordinary from what we're used to but honestly I think that's just the name of the game and depending on what season of life we're in it's either going to be a yes or no and I think both and answers are valid it depends just where you're at in life and if it's a yes then sometimes it'll work and sometimes it won't but either way you'll learn something from [Music] it my creative Journey so far has been
[Music] there's a certain naive confidence you have when you just enter your 20s unlike any other part of your life it's the easiest to lose and the longest to get back and if there was one part of the era I could take to the next I think it probably would be that it is quite the claim that this is the mindset that helped me navigate my 20s out of everything else but looking back I can't imagine all the things I would have missed out on and all the things that led to another since then it is truly one of the few themes in my life that keep on reoccurring in between all the years and different context and routes and each time still holds this universal truth that it starts with what you think you can do but ends with finding [Music] out so I hope you enjoyed this video it was very fun to revisit a topic and see where I was at with it safe to say my trip to California with Megan was not a disaster in fact it was the complete opposite guess you got to see a little bit of the behind the scenes in this video but Megan made a beautiful video while we were on a trip in California so if you haven't seen that yet then please check it out as always thank you for watching you can find me on Instagram at leera in the meantime and I will see you in the next one bye",The mindset shift that changed my 20s.,01.09.2024,Life of Riza,Woman,Early 20s,07:34,6,"0,9987"
https://youtu.be/tOGCa35UjtY?si=VOhkDRn5zZQSIT5-,Marysia,again I've always been envious of girls who are friends with each other you know girls who have lots of friends when you are alone you figure out a lot of things that you never really know about yourself when you're just completely alone with no friends I feel like there's a certain breakthrough that you probably never have am I worthy of having friends don't ever let having no friends to stop you from living your best life whoa hey that was a really bad intro anyways hi everyone welcome back to my channel so for this journal entry episode eight we're going to be talking about why having no friends is completely okay I'm kind of shocked that I haven't talked about because as you guys can see I do a lot of things by myself I've always had trouble keeping friends long term this can go into a lot of issues of mine and as a kid I've always been extremely insecure because I didn't have you know a lot of friends that I had like really low self-esteem ever since I was a kid I did everything by myself but it was always kind of like I had to I didn't really learn to enjoy doing things by myself as a kid I've always been envious of girls who are friends with each other you know girls who have lots of friends and I always wanted to be like that but as I gotten older I realized how having no friends is really okay it really is when you are alone you figure out a lot of things that you've never really known about yourself because sometimes when you're in group setting a lot of us tend to just like go with the flow you go with what your friends want I want to do this because I just want to enjoy their company which is completely fine but you don't realize what you want you like this activity because you guys are doing it together right you have your friends company you like their company so as you like this activity that doesn't mean you like this activity when you have no friends to hang out with all you have is yourself so you really try to do things that you enjoy right it's very obvious like you know we all want friends so it's very very normal to feel lonely because sometimes I feel like when we feel lonely it's like you feel bad about it you're like but you need to understand that is very very normal it is normal to feel lonely it is normal to want company from people and start pushing the thought away I tell myself that this is normal I'm a human being I shouldn't want to socialize with people friendships can also make you feel lonely just because you're in a group of people doesn't mean that you would feel included right somehow you're in a group of people feel like an outcast you just feel like oh my God like I feel like nobody here really gives two shits about me like I said I'm just here just to be here I just want the company of others even though I'm not really enjoying their company so would you rather be feeling lonely by yourself or feeling lonely in a group personally I would rather feel lonely by myself like what's the point hang out with people if you feel lonely when you're with friends you can become so fixated on them you can become so focused on them that you don't really care about what you want you don't care about the goals you have because some of us just want to hold on to that song want to hold on to these friends because you just feel you've been alone for so long what if they leave me what do they leave me for someone else whether I'm not good enough and I don't blame you because you know we all want friends sometimes you might even lose your passions and your goals you might set that aside it's like a thing that you don't even realize and that is not to say like this is a friend's fault it's our fault I'm not encouraging YouTube boyfriend when you're just completely alone with no friends I feel like there's a certain breakthrough that you probably never have I mean of course it gets dark sometimes but also it can be a breakthrough you realize how capable you are to do absolutely everything by yourself once you have this mindset even when you get back into friend groups you will still have this mindset I personally don't think it can be taken away once you have this breakthrough when you have no friends you realize that I have to do everything for myself sometimes these things is just like you have to just do it you have so much fear you're like oh my God I cannot do this I have to do this with someone else but you can literally sometimes we just overthink but the things that when we think so much about it it's a waste of energy it's literally a waste of energy to be anxious about a 24 7. just do it because trust me when you actually do the thing it's not as scary as you think I feel like sometimes when you just have no friends sometimes you try to prove yourself am I worthy of having friends and then you start doing things to make yourself feel I need to better myself feel I'm worthy for friends but the things that you are worth your friend you can create a better version of yourself but make sure that you're creating it for the right reason you're creating it for yourself that's a proof to anyone that you are worth your friends because you are I I had this negative mind this where I feel oh I don't deserve friends because I have mental issues friendship breaks down I blame it all myself I'm like oh this is my fault this is my fault I was the one who called it off I'm the one who who left for friendship to work there needs to be both parties right I sometimes need to remind myself that they also didn't do anything to fix the friendship I tell myself that just because I am mentally ill doesn't mean that I don't deserve friendships and this was something that I felt like almost as if I'm punishing myself but when I came to realize is that I am trying to better myself and I feel like that counts for something if you feel like oh my God I feel so alone I have no friends like I must be such a loser but the thing that you cannot force it just because you have friends doesn't mean that you're you're less worthy compared to other people who do and I'm also not saying that like oh we should look down on people who have friends because there are friendships that are extremely beautiful healthy healthy friendships you know supporting one another some of us just haven't found the right people and I want you guys to stay home cool really genuine so easy to just be like that's their fault steer for us for somebody it is but sometimes you realize maybe I'm the problem it speeds up your self-growth when you realize that there's a problem within you because we're human we all have problems don't shame yourself don't try to close yourself off just because all my friends down it doesn't mean that you're not gonna have friends in the future right there's a lot of people who are dealing with us especially if you're in your early 20s it's not talked about enough once you realize how capable you are when you are alone it's almost like a superpower in how your happiness can come from just within yourself you don't need anyone to complete you yes I can help it can make you happier but you can get all the happiness you want from within yourself you can spread happiness when you are happy if you are unhappy how the hell can you spread happiness [Music] I'm not saying that no you have to spread happiness to others it can make an interaction more joyful and you can realize how when you are happy you attract more people like I tend to get insecure and sometimes like I project I sometimes just think oh just because I'm insecure about so and so they probably think bad of me which is really toxic and it goes to show you this because I'm insecure but if I was happy if I was confident this interaction that happens with another person will be great I wouldn't be so self-conscious I I wouldn't think about it I want to think that because I'm confident I'm feeling good which is why I believe that you need to achieve your happiness foreign you can achieve all the happiness with yourself you want to go sit by the beach go sit by the beach and when you do these things that builds up your confidence and when you build up your confidence you realize how you can do almost everything by yourself I'm not saying that you're doing all of this to just you know attract people but you're becoming happier at the same time you're attracting people so it's like a win-win why not I'm not trying to be like oh you can do everything by yourself so you don't need other people I'm saying that don't close yourself off to people I want you guys to enjoy her alone time but when people come you can be the judge of that who you want to let in slowly get to know them don't get attached too fast don't build this image of them of food they're gonna be and don't feel like and so be it they're not right for you slowly get to know them and be patient they'll slowly show you who they are and then get to decide whether you want to continue pursuing the apprenticeship I feel like I have been more open to people that I have been able to meet a lot of good people good friends this year when I hang out with friends I like it's like I genuinely enjoy it like I genuinely go back home like I really enjoy that interaction which I'm really proud to say because like back then I sometimes go get home from interaction with like friends and it just it feels awful however I still at the same time enjoy my alone time as well because there's something different when you hang out by yourself it's also amazing when you can hang out with really good friends you need to make sure that you don't lose your sense of identity when you hang out with people I mean of course your identity can always change but just hold on what feels true to you hold on to yourself no matter who you hang out with it took me to lose the Friendship to understand who I was and I'm not saying like oh my God that friendship in order to figure out who I am when the friendship ended I realized how much things I wanted to do that I never realized I wanted to do before because I was just fixated on them ever since then I know what I want and I have goals I know what I like and I know what I don't like and this all happened because I was alone for so long [Music] do a lot of things by myself a lot what you guys can clearly tell from the content of this channel life can be very lonely something that makes it more bearable is just finding things that you like doing life is worth living with kind people and sometimes it can just take a little tiny thing to make your day really really great it's normal to feel lonely and feel like you have no one to talk to but don't let that stop you from living don't ever let having no friends to stop you from living your best life okay because you're life does not depend on others you have yourself and that is more than enough all you need to do is believe in yourself and when you realize how much you can achieve when you are alone you become Unstoppable and I'm not lying with that I'm really not the reason why you'll be unstoppable is because the things that you want to do no one can stop you the only person that can stop you is yourself so when you realize that I'm not gonna become my own obstacle and you go achieve that you can do it just because you have no friends doesn't mean that you can't achieve your dreams or whatever has certain issues that are preventing your own reading products that's why self-reflection is very important going to therapy journaling self growth important when you have these issues you you want to get better [Music] um that's the end of my journal entry episode eight why having your friends is completely okay I hope you guys enjoyed the journal entry I'm really happy to be able to talk about this I guess I wish someone had told me this maybe when I was younger um which is why I'm making this video trust me you'll find good people along the way but as of now better yourself and do what makes you happy okay okay anyways I will see you guys all very very soon I hope you guys will have a lovely rest of your morning afternoon or night okay okay bye,“I have no friends” and why it’s okay,28.07.2023,Via Li,Woman,20s,10:05,6,"0,9999"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EPnNOlxF8M,Wentao,i have to know how my brain works um in order to catch it from doing bad things because the brain is really tricky and it will tell you things that aren't true and so knowing that i would remember a negative experience more than i'd remember a positive i would really make it my mission to go okay but the positive experiences with that person were equal i'm gonna choose to let that negative experience go [Music] it's hard to put into words honestly and it feels different at different times when my anxiety is high it feels like an absolute inability to make decisions like i would rather not do something then decide what to do and it's almost paralyzing which is odd because it seems like it's simple do you want to go on a walk or sit on the couch and watch tv and i'm like i can't figure that out my i don't have the brain power it feels like decision fatigue and then depression is different my version of it feels very restricted like um like if you're trying to put on like a latex glove that's way too small for your hand also it sort of coincides with this feeling of not being excited about anything which again on a day when you feel great or even normal you can get excited about things like you're like oh i'm gonna have pizza today or i'm gonna see a friend today or i mean all of the fun things about life and when i'm having depression it's like none of those things are exciting or seem worth it so there's this real disconnect because i know logically that should be a feeling that induces some happiness but it's like my depression will not let me recognize those feelings at 40 i don't like believe anything should be taboo anymore like i talked to my kids about sex and yes they're very young but they wanted to know how they got here and we talked about it and they were grossed out and left the room and that's fine but i think that anything that's taboo and hard to talk about should be some of the first priorities you should be talking about with the support systems in your life i wish that i had known as a person in the public eye to talk about it publicly at an earlier date i had been acting and you know doing publicity for a while and i was at the stretch the last stretch of of two movies of a press tour and i'd done all these interviews and i was lying in bed about to do sam jones which is a long-form interview like it's like a 45 minute to an hour sit down so you better be prepared to talk right and i said to my husband god i have nothing to talk about i feel exhausted like i've said every story about my life and he said why don't you talk about your struggle with anxiety and depression and it like was a huge light bulb i was like have i never i've never done that i was experiencing the same thing that everyone else was which is like well just don't talk about that and then i just felt so inauthentic and irresponsible to have been presenting this like bubbly happy person which is someone that i cultivate and i nurture and i try really hard to exist as um and i just wasn't being honest with the people like the girls who may look up to me and so i was like okay i'm just gonna talk about it and so i don't even think that sam knew but during that interview i was like actually you know for a period of my life and periods and often and sometimes just on a random wednesday i feel this way and then we started to get more in depth and i found myself really happy to be admitting all of it and the response i got from that interview was like astounding to me like so many people saying i've felt that way too thank you for saying it out loud you gave me the courage to say it out loud which i i mean i did practically nothing other than do what i should do which is be honest and authentic and it really it was a huge turning point in my life i just felt a huge sense of responsibility um and so i kept talking about it and i talk about it a lot and here we are i started noticing like a feeling of being disconnected when i was probably 18 or 19. i moved out of detroit and to new york when i was i just turned 18. i was like two weeks into being 18. and i was so excited it was all i wanted to do i was going to nyu i was studying musical theater i was living in this beautiful like melting pot cultural city and seeing you know broadway shows each night and it was it was wonderful and i i i just felt like if i wrote my life down on paper i had so many opportunities so much privilege so much access to happiness and yet my feelings were not that as an 18 year old living on her own in new york city i should be like yes like it should be so exciting but it wasn't i felt like i was sort of followed by this weird dark cloud that just didn't allow me to see all the happiness around me and i was lucky that i felt in my bones that that wasn't how i sh i hate to use the word should but should be feeling or how i could be feeling i guess and i was lucky enough that my mom had sat me down and had a conversation with me and she said hey just a quick heads up um i experience these feelings sometimes your grandmother experienced these feelings sometimes she's a nurse and so she recognized that there could be a hereditary component to a serotonin imbalance and she said if you start to feel any of these things just know there are a variety of ways that you can reach out to people or try to fix it and you don't sort of have to live like that it's such a hard thing to talk about like i i don't like that there's any sort of stigma to it but i i get it it's a weird thing to talk about because it's not an affliction that you can see it's like a hard thing to i guess diagnose and also acknowledge and a lot of families or support systems or anyone in your life they don't know how to talk about it especially if they aren't themselves feeling it i think i had an upper hand because my mom had explained it to me in a very medical way early on and i was like oh okay you sort of armed me with the information um about what could happen and maybe it never will but if it did there's access to help i knew that there were all of these ways like talking to a friend finding a therapist talking to a psychiatrist or a psychologist and just knowing that changed everything for me even if you're not experiencing any mental health issues i would hope that you would walk through life being open and ready to be a shoulder if someone needs you because the the reality is we're not all born the same some of us are born with a ton of confidence and then some are born really timid and i just feel like maybe this is just my maternal instincts talking but i just don't want anyone to feel like they don't have a support system so if we collectively as a society like self-care this whole idea should also include caring about each other you know it has to obviously be on the person to identify the feeling and say i need help but then i think it has to be on the people around them that love them to say okay let me see if i can support you you know even if that's just checking in once in a while ,Kristen Bell on Living with Depression and Anxiety | Body

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eytNiPy0xg0,Wentao,remember what the stoics say that the whole world is a temple of the gods i mean look at that sunset look at this beach look at this life it hit me at some point during the craziness of the pandemic that that i was an anxious person i mean i knew i used to get anxious about specific things a flight an important meeting getting up on stage in front of people but when all that went away like everyone else you know you're stuck in your house and you realize you're still anxious and of course you're anxious about what's happening in the world but you're just generally anxious the anxiety is in you you might not think of the stoics as anxious people partly because the reputation of the stoics is that they're invulnerable that they're invincible that they have no emotions but we know that marcus aurelius struggled with anxiety because if he didn't he wouldn't have written so many reminders to himself about how to deal with it i'm about a bunch of tried and tested strategies for reducing addressing alleviating hopefully eliminating anxiety in your life i know they've worked for me it's definitely an ongoing battle as it was for marcus aurelius as it was for seneca but these strategies work and so here in today's episode are some stoic strategies for reducing anxiety i hope you like them [Music] little things are not small george washington's favorite expression was manny mickles make a muckle i think zeno said it better he said well-being is realized by small steps but it's no small thing marx really says we assemble our life action by action step by step no one can stop you from that so today as you get discouraged as you look at this gold it's way way off in the distance don't focus on that focus on the immediate task in front of you concentrate like a roman as marcus aurelius says do this thing in front of you as if it's the only thing that matters is if it's the last thing that you're doing in your life and that adds up it's no small thing many michaels make a muckle as washington said stuff adds up that's how you get there one step at a time one day at a time one action at a time one insight at a time just go now marx really says just remember you're lucky to be alive to be alive in this moment even if things are crazy and insane and awful in the world they're also wonderful because you're getting to experience them and to take that for granted to be bitter or jaded or cynical about that it's to waste this gift you've been given and there's a reason they call it the present it is a gift and look even if this is not the most wonderful time to be alive it's the only time in which you are alive so we focus on what we control which is our perceptions our opinion about things without we control not when and where we are we try to make the most of it we try to accept it we try to be grateful for it and that's how we find happiness now in this present moment no matter what's happening in the world [Music] one of my favorite quotes from marcus real is he says you know you don't have to have an opinion about that and i just think about that all the time i don't have to have an opinion about this i can just let it be i can ignore it i can realize it doesn't pertain to me or i can just see it as it is i don't need to say that it's good or bad fair or unfair it just is i'm going to look at it as an objective piece of information it doesn't need me projecting my thoughts or or beliefs or perceptions on it it is you don't have to have an opinion about this the key to tranquility and peace marcus aurelius says is when you stop caring what other people say what other people think what other people are doing he says the tranquility that comes when you care about only what you do and say the tranquility that comes when you stop caring what they say or think or do only what you do a stoic is not someone who stuffs their emotions down that's not it at all the stoics processed their emotions this is why they journaled socrates went around asking these questions this is why seneca would write these letters to his friend lucillus we even have some of marcus aurelius's letters that survived the stokes were not stuffing their emotions down pretending they don't have them they were exploring them that the stoics talk about taking an emotion when it hits you and putting it up to the test observing it meditating on it processing it getting to the bottom of it you know if you just ignore your emotions if you just conquer them to me it's like putting it on a credit card sure you're not having to pay for it now but eventually it's going to come due and the interest is going to make it even more expensive so don't shut your emotions down deal with them process them explore them get through them don't be ruled by them in ignoring them you are guaranteeing that later it's going to be an even bigger deal and you're going to be even more powerless over that emotion so work on your emotions do not fall into this trap the stoics suppress their emotions they domesticate them as the seam tulip says but first that requires facing them and exploring them and coming to terms with them seneca points out that we suffer more in imagination than in reality meaning that all the things we're anxious about the things we worry about the things we spend a lot of time hoping won't happen most of them never do happen there's that great twain quote where he talks about how he's suffered through many things in life and how many of them have never actually happened because that's what he means in our mind we're torturing ourselves we're worried that this could happen and that could happen we're worried about this possibility or that possibility but the reality is now is now you don't control whether that will happen or not what you do control is now you of course control how prepared you are for the adversity of the future the uncertainty of the future but what you mainly control is the present moment take advantage of the present moment don't give up the present moment because you're really worried and off thinking about what could and almost certainly will not happen in the future [Music] no one can harm you at least according to the stoics they can hurt you they can say cruel things they can attack you they can cut you they can make you bleed but to the stoics harm was a choice you decide to see yourself as harmed by it remember eleanor roosevelt no one can make you feel inferior without your consent we choose to feel harmed you are hurt the moment you believe yourself to be epic cheetah said marx really says don't want to be harmed don't choose to feel harmed we control our emotions we control our opinions we control our the story we tell ourselves about what happened and that's why the stoic said you are complicit when you feel harmed you choose to see it that way i do this one thing every single day and you can see i'm a little sweaty right now i just went on a long walk with my kids this is the property there but we just went on this long walk around our property we talked we threw sticks we told stories we were just outside there's this great expression from nietzsche he says only ideas had when walking have any worth and i think that's right even seneca talks about how the mind must be given over to wandering walks he says fields that are not allowed to rest will not bear plants and and he even says that you know the mind will break like an anvil if not rested and so this is really important for me walking is physical activities it is exercise but it's really about letting my mind rest i leave my phone at home i leave my thoughts at home i leave my work at home and i just go outside and i walk and i don't even consider it exercise it's exercise for my mind it's time i spend with my family it's time i spend on my property it's time i spend outdoors it's time i spend practicing gratitude and appreciation this is a thing i do every day without fail whether it's in a parking lot or on a beautiful beach somewhere i go outside and take a walk and so should you people ask like what is the best way to start journaling and the best way to start journaling is to start journaling look there's a bunch of different ones you can do i like the one line a day journal this is just like a moleskine this is a gratitude journal that i like this is the daily stoic journal but it doesn't really matter journal on your phone journal on a scrap of paper on the back of your to-do list it doesn't matter but the idea is that you journal every single day just do it right just get started the best time to have started journaling is a long time ago the second best time is right now so if you want to start journaling start journaling [Music] epictetus tells us that every situation has two handles he says there's the handle that will bear weight and the handle that won't he says you could look at it as your brother has wronged you he screwed you over he's hurt you or you could say i only have one brother this is my brother i'm gonna forgive this person i'm gonna be patient i'm gonna be better we're gonna be better for having gone through this so this idea that every situation you can choose to see it as the way that disempowers you that makes you the victim or you can choose to see it as the opportunity for growth as the thing that will make you better as the thing that will make you stronger for having to wrestle with so i just love this idea and it comes from a person who's not speaking about this ideally like you and i are so privileged compared to epictetus who's born a slave in rome he spends 30 years in slavery but he doesn't see this as a huge

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZYKY0fMf1E,Mark, So let's make some tea before we have our chat. So today I am having this Fefemin's tea. English is called Peppermint. I've tried the other tea before and it's my first I'm trying the Fefemin's tea. I think in general it's quite pleasant what they have. I have to hold the towel this because there were multiple times. It would just point to the cup. So I have my tea here and just want to have a little chat with myself and maybe it will be helpful for you as well. It doesn't have to be you doing the same thing like I do as trying to make content but anything in life really. That I'm inspired by people around me who are paying attention to details more. I think give you an example. So yesterday at work there were a mess that made by an event that we had on Saturday and I was a little bit frustrated so I didn't particularly clean up everything that I see because we're supposed to have a cleaning surface so I was thinking like you know I could clean on top of what they have done the next day. And then today I got a feedback from my boss saying that like we should give an eye and try to organize things and he make details into for example organizing the sofa picking up the fallen curtains all these things and then it's a little bit me think. First of all my first reaction is that come on it was a mess and we managed to clean one floor there were two floors so there was really limited time and then the elevator wasn't working so I feel like I am in the right of the progress that I've done. And I owned up to my mistakes and I told my boss that like it was me asking the other colleague that no need to do deep cleaning because the cleaning surface will come because I don't want to give more work to someone else who didn't make the mistakes or arrangement. But then later on I said to feel a little bit different. I said to think in a different angle the reason why my boss is saying the things that he said and then he is doing the things that he do is because he is a dedicated person and the person that cares about detail so it doesn't matter if something's gone wrong he still helps a standard that wants to give the best experience to the members. Mind you is a working space so the space would be used by other people so I've learned the self reflection here thinking. In life many times I am not exactly giving my 100% and there are times that I giving my 100% and today or yesterday it was the time that I'm not giving my 100% and I was consciously doing so because I was also not happy about what happened at work is that before the event starts their community manager asked me to borrow and if they can use so many things when in fact the floor wasn't paid by them because they are our members and I don't get into details so basically they didn't pay so I was communicated that all we could provide is the value and we cannot give more resources on that. And then after that I on Monday when I see the mess or the things that we agree on that I remind the community manager to do we're not fulfilled I am disappointed because I feel like the person could also communicate with me that they haven't done this and the worst things happen was that the person telling my boss that something broke and it was already broken when I was doing this tour around the space before the events. I was speechless and the first reaction I was like really did I miss it? That was like a test book gaslighting and I mentioned it during the meeting and I said I feel like she's like gaslighting me and I keep going through my memories trying to prove that like there must be a time stamp or points that prove that that thing wasn't broken. In that case it was because there were other events that happened before the event so if it's already happened it's just impossible and I'm glad that my boss is a very understanding that they say like don't think too much about it I already immediately said that it's nonsense and they ask me to not get gaslighted by the person and I'm thinking why I'm so uncertain about myself so then it brings us to back to myself why do I second guess myself? When other people are not even me but they are very sure that like that's impossible so that's one reflection that I'm having because to be honest it does happen in life in the past that people would gaslight and I tend to self-doubt and gradually thankfully working this job building up my confidence in the way that I didn't know secretly that I believe I am a person that is capable of doing what I'm doing and that I've been doing good job and I am dedicated so they have been recognized and I'm thankful for that and growing older also means that I see through more things or other people with the behavior and actions and words and in the same sense I judge people much easier now basically you can tell someone's personality by small stuff and I hold the same standard for myself because I'm definitely not perfect I can be also deceival but in the sense of having a higher self awareness and choose to be a person that I want other people to be as well so people would like to say treat other people how you would like to be treated in this case I don't really feel like that person probably gets through life by doing the same thing same pattern lying about things or gaslighting people to get to where she is and it could be her upbringing so I'm not gonna get into detail but it makes me angry it makes me pissed because I was trying so hard out of my way to be of convenience for them and I was wish to be treated the same but it wasn't the case so I think that has a change effect on me not giving my best when it comes to tidy up the place because yesterday there were none of our team except one person at work so I don't want to clean up everything trying so hard with Del Dem seeing how messy it was because I did take pictures but the pictures just not reflecting how it actually is so subconsciously and consciously I was making this decision but with the feedback now I understand that at the end of the day oh my foot is here um yeah at the end of the day um I just feel like it's definitely something I don't need to do it this way next time I think this time I feel good because normally if people blaming on me not blaming like giving me feedback like this I would feel unhappy because I feel like I have all the reasons to not do what I do but I feel good because I listened to my emotions and mood and not stretching myself to just to get it done because I feel that it's injustice for myself um so even though I resist this feedback I actually feel fine I can see it from a very neutral perspective that being a boss being in the owner of the space thing they definitely want to make things good regardless of what happened regardless of how the people feel so um I feel like I still done the things that is good for me because I have a feeling that if I stretch myself trying so hard to clean up everything I would just feel all this resentment um and the recognition probably won't be able to compensate how I feel because at the end of the day I was the only one that is receiving this kind of feeling um so I don't know what do you think about this I think at the end of the day is important to how we feel about ourselves nobody can help you feel how you feel so you're responsible for all feelings so just do things in a way that no not harming others but take care of your own feelings I definitely think I handle the situation very differently compared to the usual khaki because um people pleaser is such a disease and I um people please a behavior it's something that I have been called out before and I recognize it but not to the extent to this very granular deep level so this even actually and talk about this actually help me think so reflect so next time I wish I could be also the person to talk to that person again up to express my disappointment because my boss even though he's really young he actually asked me to do that and I in the end didn't really do it because I don't want to do it and why do I want to do it is because confrontation to expressing my resentment I feel like it does not really serve um for the next corporation but I should remember it and the next time if something like this events about to happen I need to bring it up and remind the person um so yeah I am happy with what how I do with the situation and thank you for listening to this rant and I hope it helps you to reflect on how do you feel about situation and do you want to prioritize your own feeling I know it's also a privilege because a lot of times um people have a lot of different obligations and they have to put down the ego put down the emotions and then just get things done and I especially feel like men are false to do so and so I want to at least tell you that sometimes it's okay to do that because at the end of the day nobody feels how you feel and you are responsible for your own feelings and I hope you have a great day and I'll see you next time,Yapping and some self reflection,19.11.2024,Kaki,Woman,20s,13:16,9,"0,9991"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KtH6djBvB0,Mark," Hi, Professor. I'm going to play my audio that I've submitted for myself reflection and hope that you can hear it through this method and then I'll upload the video. So let's see how it goes. I'm going to turn up the volume and just hit play. Hi, this is Arthi Chandra with her submission for my first critical self reflection. Question one, how do the films watched up to this point make you film? The films I've watched up to this point have overall made me feel grateful and inspired for the history and the experiences of the Italian people. I really love learning about the connection between the films and life post World War II, the relationship between Neuralism and the everyday people who became the actors and the film goers. I loved watching films about characters who would have been the everyday people of Italy at the time. And the emotions that start up when I watched them is I felt very curious, focused, happy, sad, delight, heartbreak, anger, appreciation, wonder, intrigue, and so many more things. Memories of my own family, relationships, dreams, and everyday life came up for me as I watched these films. Did I relate to the films? Why or why not? I really related to the experience of loneliness that Antonio felt in the crowds during bicycle thieves. I really related to penis care for her family in open city. Francesca's discovery and appreciation of sisterhood and bitter rice was something that I related to. A mother's determination and desire for a better life for her daughter and Belissima spoke to me. The lead female in Lestrado, the sadness she felt as she left her family behind and started a new life. I have felt that in my own life as well. And the realization of disconnection in a long-term relationship I can journey to Italy was something that I also related to. The next question, what have you learned from their readings? How has has film criticism taught you something? Their readings and film criticisms have taught me a lot about the film's messages and backgrounds. I learned about open city being shot on black market film. I learned about the message of a son's love being the most valuable possession. In bicycle thieves, I learned about the influence of U.S. films and Hollywood and bitter rice. I learned about the relationship between Visconti and the main actress and I and Belissima. I learned that Phelini's wife played Belied in Lestrado. I learned that many that great art may not be appreciated at first as was for the film Journey in Italy and that sometimes it takes time for others to appreciate what you believe in. What ideas, topics, or directions were missed from criticism and what do you think could be pursued to understand the film's better? I would have liked the criticisms to discuss the topic of why Journey to Italy was in English. We'll lead to this change. How did it come about and why? How did this change the tone, message, and style compared to Visconti's other films? It would be nice to read about how the film would be different if the characters spoke Italian and because it was the first film of the series that was in English, I would like to hear more about the journey of that decision. So that is my first self reflection. Thank you for listening. All right, let's see the audio catches.",Critical Self Reflection 1,18.11.2024,Aarti Chandra,Woman,20s,4:09,6,"0,991"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyVKElCCRig,Josy," Hello, besties. I don't even know how to start this video. So if you haven't been able to tell, I haven't been very active this month across all my social media platforms. I kind of gave a brief explanation in my last video about my mental health struggles. So I'm just gonna come out and say it. I am not okay. I know I'm smiling and I also kind of explained in my last video that when I'm on camera, I am a genuinely happy person because I like to be happy on camera. But to be brutally honest, I have been in a depressive episode for the past two months. Yeah, which is why I have not been very active at all this month because I've literally just been depressed. And I'm gonna be blunt. Like there's no sugar coating around it. And again, I have a smile on my face right now. That's because I'm feeling good to film and it's making me very happy because every single day this past month, I've just been wanting to film videos like I love to do. And today I woke up and I feel kind of okay, which is good. Considering yesterday, I did not leave my bed at all except to go get food and that's not an exaggeration. I didn't go outside for like 48 hours. So it's been deep. It's been a deep dark hole I've been in. And yeah, I just feel kind of good today. And I wanted to film even though I don't know what I'm gonna do. But I already took a walk, which is something that I also have not been doing. You know what I'm gonna do right now? I'm gonna talk about things I've been struggling with because I've seen this over TikTok and stuff like that. Just, you know, some influencers talking about what they've been struggling with. I think the idea kind of came from Victoria, Paris. I don't really know. But yeah, let's do a quick little deep dive in the introduction of this video. And if I don't scare you guys away, then that's really cool. That's awesome. Cool. I don't mean to unload a bunch of stuff right now in the beginning of the video, but um it is what it is. Like I said, my main struggle is I've been just depressed. And it's one thing being depressed and then another thing, observing that you're depressed, especially too when I've made so much progress over the last year, you know, the nasty little thoughts in my head are telling me. I've just regressed. I have relapsed. I don't know if that's the right word, like relapsing to depression. I'm a failure. That type of stuff, you know, the words that aren't actually yours, but they still attack you. Especially to lying in bed all day for 16 hours a day that doesn't make me feel great. Even though I lightly can't get up and do anything. I haven't been walking or exercising or doing any of my habits such as yoga, meditation, I journal a little bit. Um, when I have the energy too, I've literally just been rotting my brain away on TikTok and reading books. And another reason why I haven't been exercising and stuff, because I usually do an hour long walk every day. Like that's been my main form of exercise, but it's been so freaking hot. Like I turned off my fan, not even for five minutes, you can tell my face is probably going to be completely oil-sliced by the end of this because it's so hot out and it's making me miserable. And you know, seasonal depression usually comes in the winter, but it's hidden me this summer. That's been tough because you know, the sunlight and the exercise are major factors in keeping me personally happy. And I have not been able to do them because it's so hot in miserable outside that yeah, I could force myself to walk, but it wouldn't be enjoyable to me. And then as I kind of alluded to, like I've just been wanting to film so much, but obviously I'm not going to film because I'm one not doing anything until I'm not feeling good. Today woke up and I felt pretty good. Could be the new medication that I'm on. The little happy pills, uh, told you I'm going to be brutally honest right now. But yeah, it's been really, really, really tough recently. Every day my brain has been screaming at me to get up and do things. Just one thing, whether it be a quick little yoga session or a stretch or a walk, and you know when you're depressed, you just can't. No matter how much you want to, you just cannot. But today I'm feeling like I can do something. Which is my stomach's rumbling, which is one thing I need to go to the store and get some food because I'm hungry and I don't have the food I want in the house right now. And I feel good enough to do some yoga. I actually did go for a walk. I think I said that already. But yeah, okay, we're five minutes in. Sorry, that was a lot, but I'm just trying to be open and honest because I owe it to myself and I don't really owe it to anyone else, but I feel like I owe it to the greater good of the internet. Be honest and open about mental health because it's not pretty. It's not. I changed out of clothes I was wearing for about four days. Like I said, I didn't leave my bed at all of our shanae except to literally get up and eat or pee. Okay, let's go to the store. Haven't been out like all week. So let's go to Target. I literally have my hair up already because it's so hot, but here's the fit. It's so basic. That's just been like another thing that's been feeding into my sadness is because it's so hot that I can't wear anything but a tank top in shorts every day. And I don't like these type of clothes. Like I have no sense of fashion. Can I express myself the way I want to? Therefore I hate the way I look every day. Don't leave my house because I wear the same four tank tops and pairs of biker shorts every day. And I just feel like not myself because they're just nothing but clothes to like keep me cool. Like it's there's nothing exciting about my outfits or fashion. So I don't want to leave the house. So that's another thing. That's like a first world problem though. Anyway, let's go to Target. Okay, Target haul. I'm quite cute. My bag is I really wish I could tell you where it's from, but it does not have a tag on it or anything. I got a very little mail on stuff because I really just need it some fruits but I picked up other things. Saltines because I genuinely enjoy eating saltines at the snack. I decided to treat myself to some ice cream because I haven't had it in a bit. And I never tried this one before. The Oatly and I got mint chocolate chip because mint chocolate chip is superior. And if you don't like it then you are a child. I'm more granola. Also, never tried this before. This is the mixed berry granola. You know how much I love they've been added out one. Thought I would switch it up. It's been on a huge fruit berry kick because pretty much I've just been eating cold foods for salad yogurt because I can't tolerate anything hot. I really sound like such a wimp, but this heat is just really getting to me this year. I got some apples and then craving apples like crazy. I want to lie. I made a massive thing of strawberries which was surprising because not gonna lie. Target strawberries usually suck like they would like look horrible the time they happen at it. And right now, oh wait, I also got these coasters. They're just little plastic coasters because I need some coasters. And right now I'm going to show you my favorite meal. I've been eating recently. Like you guys can tell by my videos. I find food and then I eat it for like two months straight. This is my current like bird fixation meal. It is a yogurt. This is a vegan. Obviously yogurt. So delicious vanilla. Really basic. Honestly, I think all vegan yogurts taste the same. So choose whichever one is the best. Just don't be and I like to get some protein powder. This is the Vega protein and greens vanilla one. Doesn't really matter again. I would say stick to vanilla. I do half a scoop because a whole scoop would just be two powdery from the yogurt. I think if you have strawberries and just wash them and then just slice them up into the yogurt. Yes, I'm slicing it on my hand. I don't feel like getting a whole plate and like dirty dirty dirty dirty or dirty. Yeah, you can see where this is going. And finally, granola on top. And there we go. Strawberry, banana, yogurt bowl. Also has some good protein from the protein powder and it's so refreshing. Delicious. Like I said, I've been eating this every single day for like the past two weeks or so and I just mix it all around and it's just cool refreshing. So okay. So now that I ate and I'm feeling good and full I'm gonna do some yoga. I'm going back to my roots to my home girl. My yoga with Adrienne. She is the best yoga practitioner on YouTube and I'm gonna do a hips and lower back yoga because they've been hurting because I've just been lying in bed all day and my body has been due to your ratings. It's like 20-ish minutes so we're gonna do that. Okay, so I just finished my yoga feeling really good. I haven't felt this good in a while. So I'm gonna end it with some meditation when I'm grabbing some crystals. It has been a hot minute since I visited my little crystal shelf and used them so very sorry y'all. But I'm gonna grab these two which are really good for grounding a meditation. This reddish one on top is Mahogany Obsidian and this one is called Apache Tear and then I'm gonna grab my rose quartz for my heart chakra because I have a lot of tension in my chest and around my heart chakra. I'm gonna get that and then I'm also gonna get some amethyst which helps ease in anxiety and just it's a very calming stone. So going to go lay on my floor. I'm taking it back to the old days where I would do yoga meditation on my floor and then I just like to put them to kind of their corresponding chakra. Also this is just kind of how I use them. It doesn't mean it's right or wrong. I know there's a lot of like controversy about like crystals and chakras and stuff like that. I just do it for me. It will feel good. So amethyst on the third eye. I'm gonna put this on my heart chakra if it wants to stay. Maybe not. Maybe I'll put it down there and then these two and like my lower stomach for like grounding. And then I'm just gonna lay here on the ground for however many minutes and just zone out but intentionally because I've been dissociated for the past two months but now I'm doing it intentionally. At least I can joke about my issues. That's the one good side of mental illness. You can make good jokes about it. Maybe that's on a good side. Okay. Okay so now that we already did yoga and meditation might as well finish it out with some journaling. Complete my little triple threat of usual daily habits of yoga meditation and journaling and I haven't done all three of these in the day in weeks but I don't know why I'm feeling so good today but I'm going for it. Yeah so I'm just going to journal. Also I wish this was highlighter and intentional. It's not. I'm just greasy as hell. Remind you to just ignore the fan if you hear it in the background. I know it's probably annoying but me sweating to death is more annoying so. It's been a hot minute since I seen you last. I think I was journaling. I've been at my computer. Currently being eliminated by this video. My computer. I'm trying to buy a bookshelf. I mentioned this in one of my last vlogs and I want a bookshelf because I've got a lot of books. However I just can't simply buy something. I must research and read every single review ever written about whatever item it is I'm looking for. So I've been literally searching for a bookshelf for like two hours when I'm literally all I want is an open white bookshelf. However none of them are meeting my criteria. There is one that I want but it's out of stock. It's an Ikea one and it's out of stock everywhere and I can't get it shipped to me so I was planning on getting that one but it hasn't been in stock in like weeks. That's what I've been doing with my time. Can you tell me Gemini and very indecisive but literally I must have just went through every single white bookshelf on Amazon and read all the reviews and I don't like any of them. But what I'm going to do with my time now is the question because I've already wasted a lot of time but I did get a lot done which I am proud of myself for and I feel good right now. I don't know why maybe because I'm talking to the camera and you know actually doing things. I don't know I'll probably keep looking for a bookshelf. I'll probably read. I'm currently reading the Twilight series and I'm on new moon right now. I picked up the entire Twilight series of a Facebook marketplace for five dollars. All four books. These big boys are five dollars. I had to drive like 30 minutes to and from to get them so it cost more gas than I did for me to get them but it was very good purchase. I've never read them before. I've seen all the movies multiple times but those are about time that I read them so this is what I'm currently working on halfway through it. This is another hard part of just mental health just being completely disrupted from all of your routines and reality and everything like that because now I don't know what like now I literally have to like re-learn how to go be a human the next couple days if I'm still feeling good. If I'm feeling at this level of good that I am right now I literally have to go re-teach myself how to be a human being and integrate myself into the world so that's something. Now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go eat my ice cream that I just bought. Let's go get some. It is very very creamy. It's very good like real ice cream consistency however it needs a stronger mint flavor. The mint is like barely there. Chocolate chips are good though. Need more mint. I buy mint chocolate chip for the mint. Hello. Good morning besties. What did I end up doing last night? Still looking for a bookshelf and coming up unsuccessful. So this morning I want to make some pancakes. I don't know why I'm just really craving them. I'm gonna show you my favorite recipe that I make except this recipe I'm gonna like modify it a lot. So it's not even the same with your recipe at the time. Okay so the first thing we're gonna do is actually make some oat flour which you can use normal flour but I just like you know to help benefit of oats so just take the major minnacles put it in a blender blend it up and then you have flour. Okay these are my pajamas too. Thank you. Would you look at that now it's flour. So besides for the flour part we're gonna start with the wet ingredients first. We need a two separate bowls, one for dry, one for wet. So you're gonna take your milk. You're not in dairy milk I'm using oat milk which I always find weird when I'm baking with oats and then oat milk it feels wrong in some way. I don't know why. A tablespoon of white vinegar into your milk and I know it sounds really weird. It's not gonna taste like vinegar what it does with the plant milk. It kind of like curls it and makes like a thick buttermilk like consistency. So we do the wet ingredients first so that has time to sit and get a little bit thicker. I promise you it doesn't taste like vinegar. I like a teaspoon of oil. Alright now for the dry. I'm gonna use brown sugar. I've never tried brown sugar before but I feel like it will be good you know I normally just use normal like white sugar. We need some baking powder. Interesting. Alright and now that the milk has been sitting with the vinegar and oil we're just going to mix them together. Then going to make these the nano walnut pancakes because you can't just have a plain pancake. I was gonna do blueberries because we just got some blueberries but I'm really feeling some like cozy banana walnut pancakes you know what I forgot which I do every time until I actually about to go put them on a stove add a splash of vanilla and some cinnamon to your pancake batter that this is a crucial step and I literally almost forget every time. Alright so here we go my beautiful plate of pancakes and typically I would be enjoying this with a nice hot cup coffee but if you can tell by the sheen on my face I'm already sweating from cooking these pancakes. But now in a walnut it's just a superior flavor combination. It's been like two or so hours since I ate and this is a problem with um I guess now I'm coming out of my depressive episodes and feeling pretty okay. It's like I kind of mentioned yesterday like reintegrating back into life because I have no idea what to do with myself. I haven't done anything in weeks. I've just been paralyzed in my room in my bed. I haven't done anything so I have to like reteach myself how to be a human and I'm kind of paralyzed now not because of my mood but because I literally don't know what to do with myself at the moment and I would love to like go outside go for a walk or something but it's like 85 degrees out which might not seem hot to some people I know okay chill on me, southerners and whatnot but now I'm just like huh I really haven't done anything in weeks. What do I do now? Guess I'll come back to when I figure it out. Spoiler I did not figure it out. I didn't do anything. Thank you guys for watching this is obviously an outro because I forgot to film one as I do for every video but yeah genuinely just thank you for watching I just ask you be kind in the comments I know everyone's mental health proves that it's differently in mind especially differently because I'm like on camera and then editing it and then posting it yeah so like don't take everything for face value but I am trying to just be like open and honest about things and I am generally feeling better these past couple days which is good so I'm expect to see some more content from me especially this upcoming week because I have really really good content coming I don't think you guys are ready I hope you made it this far if you made it this far tell me you're excited for the upcoming week because I don't think you guys are ready and it's actually getting me excited for life that's a little too deep okay goodbye um I hope you have a wonderful day and night wherever you are and make sure that you stay tuned for my next video",coming back to life after a depressive episode lol,22.07.2021,basicallyreese,Woman,20s,17:39,9,"0,9999"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPDGLACCR3I,Mark," Alright, what's going on guys? Welcome back to A Brand New Video. In the same spot as last week's video, I just thought this was like the right place and the right vibe. I feel like to record these type of videos. Last week I know I talked about feeling purposeless and this week I wanted to talk about perspective and hope and a lot has happened in the past week I went to Abu Dhabi for a work trip and I had a lot of fun man. I'm not going to lie, I had a lot of fun. I accomplished a lot of goals and you know things that I wanted to do for so long. I sort of sat down and I was like man two years ago, I'm looking at what I'm doing right now. I would freak out. Even though all that happened, one of the best moments for me was I actually got to see one of my family members as well as out there and I saw my uncle and I haven't seen family in about eight months since moving over here and it was really nice because this isn't someone that I've been particularly close to. This past like man I don't even know maybe like 15 years of my life but it was really nice catching up with him and just seeing how similar we are as we've got an older obviously when you're a kid it's hard to relate to adults in general but I think as you get older you start to see yourself more in these people and when I went out to Abu Dhabi I was still dealing with a lot of the things that I had talked about in my previous video. I just found you know after really sitting down with my uncle I had a different perspective on things. It was funny because he lives in Australia and he was complaining about his living situation in Australia and what he kept saying to me over and over again was he wishes that he could leave Australia and he's planning to move to Dubai and all he was saying to me was how much he hates living in Australia and just like how bad it is and you know all the negatives about it and funnily enough like if me and him had had that conversation eight months ago I would have related to him and been like I fully agree man these past eight months have given me a different perspective on things and after that conversation you know I have a new perspective on this whole situation and what I talked about in my last video was this feeling of wanting something else and wanting more and just never feeling fulfilled or satisfied with things and it's funny I think when you can't see the answers in front of you or you don't have the answers I think sometimes you know God and the universe will supply you with a way for you to see the answers. What I realized in that moment was that no matter where you are in life whether or not you're happy has to do with your perspective on your current situation. Happiness is definitely a choice it's got to be because a week later from recording my last video in the same situation I was not not much has really changed except for I've got a new experience under my belt but I feel happier than I did last week and I think the reason for that is just a flip in my perspective a little bit it just gives me a lot of hope because I've been reading this book lately called The Alchemist and something it really talked about was just this feeling of being present and recognizing the omens in your life the biggest thing I've been missing in life this past like you and a half has just been this presence I haven't had the presence when I was a little bit younger and I was just starting on my journey of chasing and trying to find my purpose I had a lot of presence and was able to recognize situations and opportunities when they were right in front of me and I think as I got older and stress started building and I started going through things I sort of lost that ability to be present and I was so focused on the past and the future that I wasn't able to see opportunities right in front of me for so long and I feel like I've missed out on a lot these past couple of months because I've been just not present and I feel like God and the universe has just been providing me with all these opportunities like it does for everyone like we're all our main characters in our own movies and I just feel like I haven't been present to really capitalize on them and make the most of them. Part of that makes me a little bit sad because I'm like what have I missed but then at the same time if these things are happening for a reason or then I'll supposed to go through that phase and you know even though I feel like I've viewed off track a little bit it's funny how the world works where it presented me with this opportunity to meet up with my uncle for him to almost be a mirror and show me how I was acting and I just found it funny because the same way he was describing his living situation in Australia is the same way that I'm currently describing my new sort of living situation in the UK and I just think it's sort of a never ending cycle until you truly learn how to be sort of more present with yourself and see the opportunities in your life and make the most of them because nothing will ever be enough if you're constantly looking to the next thing or you're constantly living in the past and I don't know so it's a beautiful thing because you start recognising the beauty in your surroundings and you're like where have I been these past few months because these things have been here this whole time I just haven't been able to see them. I really think happiness is a choice and not something to be attained that's it that's what I wanted to say thank you guys for watching and enjoy the rest of your day.",Self Reflection - Perspective & Hope,30.10.2024,Curious,Man,20s,5:53,10,"0,9991"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnbAUChc8i8,Josy," My name is Riley Douglas and I'm from Utah. I suffered from major depressive disorder and severe anxiety. I was referred to serenity by my therapist. I was balancing from therapist to therapist multiple times and trying all these different medications until I found a great therapist. And then he referred me to TRITMS and so let's give it a shot. It's been like 15 years now. I've just been struggling with depression and anxiety. Work was hard just due to me not having any motivation, you don't want to be there. Just when you don't have any goals, you don't want to do good at anything. And of course in my personal life, just being short tempered and just again not motivated. And I just didn't want to invest in anyone. So I just went away from everybody and tried to be by myself as much as I could. Depression to me felt like a big weight on my back and on my chest. And it just felt like after a really hard workout where you're just tired and it just felt like it took all the energy out of you. And you never wanted to do anything, no matter how much sleep you got, no matter what you did or how many copies you drank or you were just always tired and you never wanted to do anything. Just felt like everything was pointless. My experience was serenity was phenomenal. It's just from the very first appointment of seeing what options were all the way and up until the very last one was all amazing. My experience in during TRITMS was it was fun. My technician was awesome and it just felt like a friendship and the positivity just having to be positive for those 30 minutes while I was in treatment, it changed everything. It's everything that I learned during treatment, helped more than any therapist. Someone told me that they don't want to put effort into themselves and they don't deserve or they know TMS won't work. I'd tell them that they're wrong. Because that's exactly what I felt bouncing from every category of medication and every type of treatment and kind of coming to this and not knowing a ton about it and thinking that it's rainbows and butterflies, it's worth it. It's real. There's no way to describe it other than try it. Prior to TMS, everything was, I felt like everything was a chore, everything was a task. Anything from doing laundry to even just waking up in the morning, everything just felt like it was the hardest thing to do in the world. And now that I feel like I have my life back, I think about the future a lot more. I think about having a family or thing about starting a business. It's just really everything's a possibility now. Rather than thinking a week ahead, I think five years ahead and that's something I can't be more than thankful for.",Riley's Recovery from Depression,18.12.2020,Serenity Mental Health Centers,,20s,2:46,10,"0,9378"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzn6R_Pj6Z0,Josy," I didn't have any friends and if people wouldn't really approach me I would just sit alone at lunch table. The need of constantly wanting to fit in but at the same time You just don't fit in because I felt like I don't belong. I feel like I shouldn't stand out even when you do belong Into like a certain group you feel like an imposter Hi everyone welcome back to my channel this week We are going to be talking about feeling like an outcast specifically for those who just constantly feel like they don't belong Almost like you're born in an outcast. This is something that I want to talk about because I've dealt with it my whole life Being born Asian-American as a kid being shy and triverted growing up ugly I didn't have any friends and if people wouldn't really approach me and I remember we just do a lot of times in middle school I would just sit alone at lunch table I would bring a book and basically pretend that I'm reading to not look like To not feel like a loser and I would have a few friends But sometimes like if they're not there I would just read. I didn't have like the popular You know the popular girls clothes and remember uggs were a huge thing north-faced jackets were a huge thing I didn't have those so there was an appearance wise when I was younger and then I'm like all older It was the anxiety aspect of it like especially in social settings I don't know how people just go very smoothly There's people who have a lot of connections at these social events and they would just go up to people and just go Hey, what's up? And I remember there was this once back in like freshman year of college They said this upper class and then I was walking back from class and she was like oh, we should come to this party And I was like I was a freshman. I was like yeah sure. Why not? I went there. I literally stood there Everyone's like taking shots and I was scared and want to take a shot and I was there And I just felt so outcasted everyone was talking. I stood there people looked at me and nobody wanted to approach me Was in social and also at that period of time I didn't really dress up and I didn't seem inviting. I guess I was really stiff there I have been in friend groups with a thing with that they do get toxic towards the end I remember like when I was in friend groups. I felt really really Trapped like I feel like I can't go meet other people. I don't have a current friend group right now Yeah, it feels lonely and it just feels like you don't belong you don't belong anywhere Like you know people that can just like text their friends if you hey can you we like just hang out? I don't have that friend group anymore I'm like friends with individual people because for me I feel that that causes less drama when there's arguments within friend groups It can end up really badly and that's happened to me before and I don't want that to happen again And I guess like this is why people are in relationships because it makes them feel like people long They belong to another person. Oh, maybe that's a bad way to but you guys know what I mean They have this connection with this other person. They're always going to be there for them right for me is just I I don't have that and this has always been my entire life I'm always on my own little island Everyone is you know in groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and I'm just in my own little island Right here and it gets lonely because I feel like as a human everyone craves Connection so then usually when you don't belong You would try to fit in and whether that's like changing your appearance or you know changing your personality Or you know, whatever it is. I've done that. I've changed my appearance But also I will say that I changed my appearance due to myself like self care But a part of it was also I want to fit in I want people to like me I want to make friends and then I also changed my personality Which I would link the video right here where I talked about growing up ugly I was very introverted and I'm also Extroverted in some aspects, but I you know amplified it I tried to become more extroverted than I am and then it was hard to keep up the need to constantly wanting to fit in But at the same time you just don't fit in was exhausting or maybe it could also just be I haven't found the right people Which goes to my next point which is the fact that I just have to stop trying to fit in I really stopped trying to fit in and one of the prime examples of me not trying to fit in is posting on social media Back then when I was just so scared to post on social media because I thought of what people think of me What really got me through was the fact that I then fit it in the first place So who cares about post on social media? I'm not gonna like lose a bunch of friends because I did have a lot of friends to begin with True friends will stay by me and so at the end just be unapologetic We yourself as well. I learned because fitting in is so exhausting like even now I feel like I have boy social functions because I'm scared that the part of me of wanting to fit in I want to belong in like a group to talk to people and not just stand alone by myself Freaks me out, but these days I realized that I would only go to certain social functions If I'm comfortable enough if I'm comfortable with the other person then I would go Even now like even though I don't belong in any certain groups even like I am Asian-American I often just feel like I'm not Asian enough because I don't speak Mandarin as well Because I can speak Mandarin fluently, but I can't text it And also when I'm with my Asian-American peers, I just tend to feel I also don't fit in Because like a lot of them have grown up watching certain TV shows and for me I didn't grow up watching those certain TV shows and so even as a kid that just never worked out for me I remember as a kid people would talk about certain shows like I Carly or those Disney shows I didn't have access to those as as a kid like I watch a lot of like these Taiwanese historical dramas A lot of my Asian-American friends they would pack certain lunches like spam sandwich or like peanut butter San like my mom packed these parking league dumplings And I remember I would get made fun of in middle school because I would open it and it would it would have a certain scent I remember this as one girl she was on the park right girl I remember she was sitting at the end of the table and she was like She finally got things again I remember I felt so insecure I literally went back to my mom I was like mom don't pack me those dumplings And I feel so bad she must have been so confused But me as a middle school kid I just wanted to fit in and having like those kids say that It just made me feel really awful Because I felt like I don't belong I feel like I shouldn't stand out because I already don't belong And so if I even stand out it just emphasizes the fact that I don't belong So I would lower myself fit into that image that was already presented for me I was really focused on my academics I wouldn't wear makeup I wouldn't wear a certain clothes because I didn't have a good support group I didn't have like a supportive friend group or a certain community that would be like But when I got to college I changed my personality I made a friend group I was more like embracing myself Because I wanted to fit into a group so bad those friends that I had were not that compatible to begin with We didn't share a lot of the same values towards like you know like sophomore junior year I realized that maybe I just don't need to fit in I really wish that I could sit here and be like it's okay to not belong anywhere Even now I'm still trying to deal with it because it gets lonely And this year I really tried to meet more people I'm also more introverted in a sense so it's got also kind of hard for me I am trying And I feel like it also goes to the fact that I'm a pretty awkward person too I do find in certain social settings but sometimes it just I also get Pretty anxious for social settings Even when you do belong into like a certain group you feel like an imposter You feel like a fraud It's almost like you feel like you need to create the sense of person in order to fit in with other people When you grow up as a kid not fitting in with your peers It gets harder when you become an adult and then you you try to fit in and then you find that to be exhausting And then you came to the conclusion that maybe you just don't need to fit in But then when you don't need to fit it it makes you feel very alone Before I was always like I don't need to fit in who needs to fit in it's a completely fact Like I want to do my own thing by the same time I really want to be open to other people Or even like a place I don't know where exactly I belong to The lesson here about I want is to fact that if I did belong I don't think I would have done social media Basically back then I used to spam on my private Snapchat story And then I felt like annoying even though I'm forcing them to click on it Which is click on it by still I feel bad So just start spamming on my TikTok So here I am making YouTube now and I post on Instagram too So I feel like that's generally if I fit in I don't think I would have post on social media I wasn't in a friend group like no it was gonna make fun of me I was like there's nothing to lose I'll just post whatever I think that was kind of like a bit of the start where I kind of realize the fact that I don't need to belong I'm just gonna do whatever I'm not losing anything anyway like who cares I do want to meet people that I share a genuine connection with I want to keep building my own little community of people This is something I struggled with my entire life I feel like I've never belonged anywhere And it's scary but the thing that I can tell you is that Stop trying Stop trying to belong because it gets exhausting When you don't belong you can't get yourself to belong somewhere So when you stop trying to belong you'll eventually find a place of where you belong Just be yourself Be yourself do your thing because it's so easy to just fake away Into being with people that you don't actually want to be with When you're just yourself you're gonna attract people Where you feel like oh my god like actually genuinely hang out with this person It makes me feel really great about myself That's my note to you guys So yeah I hope this video spoke to some of you guys And also helped some of you guys This is my journal entry number four To anyone who feel like they don't belong I will see you guys all next week Yeah Bye which",to anyone feeling lonely and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ff4MnpUS3k,Mark," guys, this video is kind of all over the place. Before I kind of get into like the part or the clip of me like reflecting about everything, I wanted to give a little bit of a background about my high school experience and things that I've gone through in college. My freshman sophomore, junior, senior, all throughout high school, I never really felt like I had like a solid, solid friend group. I did my freshman year of high school with like a group of girls. I came into high school not knowing anyone because I switched schools. I like school districts so I didn't know a single person going into high school. It was really scary for a little me. Like I said, I had like one strong group of girlfriends and then my freshman, end of freshman year is my COVID hit and so I was just home alone and I did a lot of self-reflection and I basically kind of just realized like these friends are really not like prioritizing the same things that I'm prioritizing. Like they want to hang out every weekend. I don't have time to do that with like the goals that I have. Like I knew from a very young age I wanted to go to a top tier college like Yale was my dream, Vanderbilt was a dream. Like a school like that was like a really big goal for me. People that I was friends with just didn't have the same priorities and there's nothing wrong with that but we just didn't prioritize the same things. That's kind of when I realized like I didn't really want to be friends with them anymore and so I distanced myself and then sophomore junior year was pretty lonely. I didn't really have a lot of people to like lean on. I would get picked on a lot because I didn't really have like a solid friend group. I tried so hard my junior year. I think I could to like fit in with like the cool girls or like that friend group just because like I wanted something. I've always been totally popular. He's not a thing like don't go for being the popular girl in high school because that never works out. Everything ends after you graduate. But I still wanted it. I would get picked on a lot and I would come home from school every day and just like cry my eyes out. It was so hard to like keep the goals that I had in mind when like the immediate fulfillment things that would like bring me joy. Like if I was accepted in the popular group. If a cool girl gave me any sort of like attention and like commented on an Instagram post like I would get so excited. And it would be so hard to like keep my goals in mind because it's like I wanted to go to all these parties that the cool girls were going but I just didn't have time for it. If you are someone who is going through something similar where you are trying to fit in or like you want to be friends with the cool girls or it feels like there's nobody. You have no friends at school and you have these big goals like I did. I promise you everything gets so much better the second people across that stage. Congratulations. The last day of high school I just like felt this way just like lift off less shoulders just doing like I'm never going to see any of these people like I know I know from experience that it is like so hard just like be by yourself and keep your goals in mind especially at a young age in high school where like everything is about like belonging and fitting in and like the hierarchy of like the cool girls or whatever. I just I promise you it is so worth it. Coming from someone who went through the exact same thing. Now I'm at Vanderbilt. I'm in Greece worth it. Just stay true yourself, stick to yourself, do not get distracted by the cool girls or like going out or whatever it is that like you're trying to fit in. If you have any feelings of loneliness or like you don't have any friends like as soon as you graduate it's all going to come to you. Everything that happens to you is happening for you and not to you and it sounds kind of cliche but it's just it's so true. All of these bad experiences that you're having in high school all the times that you feel lonely all the times that you just want to like cry every single night because you feel like you don't have friends all the times where it's nothing in life can ever get worse. That is happening for you. Later in life you're going to have these experiences to talk about like I'm doing right now. You're going to have someone that you're going to inspire by your experiences, how you overcame them. It's going to make you so much stronger in the end. There's just so much more out there after high school. Really big lesson that I want you to know if you're going through anything similar to like bullying anything like that. If you're having a bad time in high school you're not picking in high school like you should be so happy that you're lonely. You have no friends. You can't go out. What's going on right now in your life is happening for you. I think it's going to be okay. Just keep working towards what you want to work towards all your goals. Keep challenging yourself. Just know if you're watching this I love you and keep going. And just trust that everything will work out just the way it's meant to be. You're going to end up exactly where you're meant to be and life is beautiful. I had a really bad roommate situation. I met this girl. I thought she was going to be like the most fun roommate ever. And she was really fun and it kind of started to go downhill because she would kind of go out and like smoke their friends every day. And that's like not something that I really liked to do. And so like I would try and like in order to like keep the friendship. I wouldn't like do it with them but I would like sit with them during the little smoke sessions. And like try so hard. I don't know I just like wanted to be with them because I knew I didn't have anyone else. That kind of went on for a couple months and then I kind of just realized like girl what are you doing? I started to try to branch out. And that's when things like went to shit with this girl. I feel like one thing that I've really struggled with. I've always done in these situations is kind of just be like a people pleaser. So like in order to keep the peace in the friendship I would always just be like okay like you win. Like I'll do whatever you say. And I wouldn't say like I wouldn't let people walk all over me but I would after a point. I would like think that I was standing my ground because I would like say my perspective on an argument or like if there was conflict like I would be like no like this is what I think. But if that other person kept like pushing and pushing I would just be like okay you're right like let's just be friends again. And I think that's something I've always struggled with. If someone and I have in conflict I always always always will avoid it rather than like talk to them about it. I don't know if that's like a fear of like losing them as a friend because of like usually conflict like big conflict doesn't come up until like much later in the friendship when we've been friends for like years or whatever. I feel like I always tell myself like you're really gonna throw away your friendship for this one stupid thing. So like I just kind of say like okay like you're right like let's just go back to like the way it was. I would tell my younger self it's like think of it scale. You have really good times with this person but does that also outweigh the way that they react to conflict or make you feel when something is wrong. And it's also like are the good times even that valuable? Like that's not something that you should be putting yourself through like so much mental English for. If it's not someone that's like really giving you a lot of value and contributing positively to your life then like why put so much of your mental bandwidth towards that because there's so much more. There's so much that you can do like put that elsewhere. I think that's like a really big lesson that I'm still working on. Realize that it's like okay you don't want to like have these friends like feel that so close into your inner circle. And so you kind of like keep them out of distance but then it's like you don't really have anyone that's like a super close friend like that. That's another thing too. For younger Mia to know not letting people in too fast just because it feels like you make like a super good connection with this person. I'm not giving you all to someone when they haven't like shown you that they are going to be like a really strong connection and they're going to contribute a lot to your life. Not same like energy level. I haven't like shown you that yet like there's no reason to let them into like your inner circles then you're just setting yourself up for like all that mental English later on that you don't want to deal with. After you come to that realization. This is where it gets hard for me. Like there's a lot of things I recognize when like things happen to me. I've gone through but I've put myself in positions so many times like over challenges like when I did sales this last summer the really hard experience because I put myself through that something that like someone else my age who hasn't gone through that experience would think like some challenge is way more stressful than it is because they don't have anything else to compare it to. It's why I always put myself. Challenge myself to new experiences like do things that are really uncomfortable. There's a bunch of different things where it's like this really big challenge like seems like it's so big. I remember thinking one day when I was on the doors for the summer 110 degrees outside and so hot and I was like melting there's no wind. There was this like dog chasing me around that probably had rabies and like bugs were biting me. It was just a really rough day. It was one of my first days and I remember thinking like I would give anything right now to be at school like writing a 10 page paper I would give anything to be like in some like stressful exam. I would give anything to like like be in high school like taking an AP exam or like working on my college applications which in high school I thought like those were like there was nothing ever that would be harder than that but it turns out there is graduating from like this challenge to this challenge makes this challenge seem like nothing compared to this challenge. Always put yourself in what I call an unstable environment you can know idea what's gonna happen and like it could be really hard and if it is like just embrace it and know that you are graduating to the next level of challenge that will make all your other challenges look super teeny tiny.","HOW I SURVIVED HIGH SCHOOL: my experiences, advice, self reflection",29.10.2024,Mia Wilson,Woman,20s,11:25,6,"0,9999"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ACzT6PCDw,Josy," My name is Will Wheaton. I am an actor, writer and producer. I have generalized anxiety disorder and I have forget the exact medical term for it, but it's sort of like chronic depression. I wasn't aware of how my mental illness was affecting me until I've been suffering from it for easily 15 or 20 years because what I accepted as just kind of normal was part of my mental illness expressing itself. When I decided to go and get help and see a psychiatrist and actually like looking to getting medication was probably about six or seven years ago. My wife and I were getting ready to go on a trip to Minneapolis. I was performing in a show with some friends and we just had a really horrible time at the airport and the people were really unhelpful and it was super crowded and we were going to miss our flight and I just freaked out and I was like, screw this, I want to cancel the show. I don't even want to go. My wife sat me down at the airport and said, I'm going to take care of this, just sit here and be quiet and when we get back from this trip you really need to go see the doctor. She had seen for a long time that I just had these really bad mood swings where I would freak out at stuff that didn't seem like my reactions to things were way out of proportion to what the actual thing was that was upsetting and it got to be really bad. It was things like this traffic is so bad that rather than sit through like 20 minutes of whatever this traffic is, forget it, I'm going home. And like real irrational decisions and things like that. My doctor told me that it would probably take about three weeks for me to really feel the effects of the medication he put me on and that was because my body needed time to react to how things change and I want to say it was like a week and a half or something like that maybe close to two weeks after I'd started treatment. My wife and I were just having a walk in the neighborhood and I realized that it was like a really beautiful day and it was warm and there was like this wonderful little bit of a breeze and birds sounded really beautiful and flowers smelled really great and my wife's hand felt really good in my hand and we're walking and I just started to cry and she was like what's wrong and I was like I just realized that I don't feel bad. I just realized that I'm not existing and living and the best way that I could describe it is like I lived my life in a room that was so loud all I could do every day was just deal with how loud it was and I found a doorway out of that room and at that moment I realized that the loudness of that room wasn't like oppressing me anymore and I was aware of a ringing in my ears which meant the noise was going away and wasn't coming back and that I was on my way to like having like a normal life that that normal for me was changing that it wasn't constantly worrying about things and it wasn't constantly giving up on stuff and feeling like it's just not worth going to my friend's house because huge list of irrational reasons that I shouldn't go and that I was going to be able to experience things and travel and just like be a person and it's so weird to say that I was like oh right I can be a person now like oh I'm learning how to human and it was the beginning of this journey that continues of learning how to live life with depression rather than living life through depression. Our life is this complicated interaction and intermingling of chemicals in our brains and experiences we have and relationships that we choose and relationships that are chosen for us and sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's hard and as long as you are doing what you can to take care of yourself and to leave every day a little bit kinder than it started things are going to be all right you are not the only person in the world who has anxiety you're not the only person in the world who has depression you're not the only person in the world who has thoughts of self-harm there are people who want to help you there are people who have spent their entire lives helping people like you and me and all of the people that you're seeing in this video and you're not alone you are okay","Wil Wheaton on Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Chronic Depression, and Recovery",25.06.2015,Project UROK,Man,40s,5:48,9,"0,997"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjHlfjPOBnE,Mark," I just opened up the first vlog and I was looking at my picture on here that I haven't changed. It was probably like since 2016, 2015 or something. I'll insert it. I'm just like, where did she go? Where did this girl go? She was being with creativity, like oozing out of her. I always feel like doing these vlogs is kind of like returning me to her anyway because I don't care how many views I get. I don't think anyone will watch these but it's kind of fun anyway because the joy back then and the joy that I'm realizing again is in the act of doing, not in the views or whatever. You must be prepared to work always without the vlogs. I feel like that. It's kind of like my journey. I had a journey back into YouTube and to this self of who I was where I just did and didn't care about the applause or what would come up. It was just almost instinct to create. I have to do a showing at 130 and I think it's like 11-something. But I want to fact here, the house a little bit. So I don't know if you guys can hear it in the play. These were going to another album. It's stunning. Every time I get here, I'm in Toronto, the house. I just like to stop. Listen. My mind blowing up. I could have this incredibly moving music. I actually didn't have time to vacuum. I just did a showing at my listening and time to go. Tonight. The work today has been so difficult my day. It may be tough to do, I can not really at night.

Because it's like annoying me to talk about this and this is a tough thing about these like diaries or vlogs or whatever you call them. You really do have to face yourself to speak about anything your day or what's going on your mind or anything of value anyway. And sometimes I don't want to face myself. When trying to read, waiting for God by some own wheel, I'm not sure what was your last name. I've heard such good things about her. I have her other book right here. First and last notebooks but this one's a hard one to start just because she writes like pretty fragmented about like, I don't know if you can see this. Maybe the point is to not follow the thread so tightly. Like the thread of thoughts, maybe to allow the looseness of understanding, the looseness of following a thread, of someone else's thread. And just enjoying the abstractness, the vagueness, letting yourself fill in the pieces. Anyways, that's our map. We did it. We finished week two. I'm editing it now, which is a little meta.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ov9XZzByA,Josy,"It's interesting when you experience an injury that others can't see, like a knee or ankle injury, because it's a lot harder for people to understand. Everyone is going through something, and success doesn’t shield you from depression. Kevin, you’re now the face of mental health in the NBA—how does that feel? At first, it was scary. I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression for a long time, and after having my first panic attack on November 5th, I didn’t even know what was happening. But now, looking back, I’ve changed my perspective. I really believe that everyone is going through something and that mental health doesn’t discriminate. I’m trying to change the stigma not just for athletes but for everyone. I remember my agent asking me if I was sure I wanted to speak out because people would talk about it, but I said, ""I’m doing this to help people."" Even helping one person can be life-changing. The panic attack was when the world got a glimpse of what was going on. That night was terrifying for me. I’ve always had anxiety, and sometimes I’d lay awake before a game, thinking about the worst things that had happened to me over the last decade. That night, everything built up—the anxiety, a rough start to the season—and I felt something I’d never felt before. During a timeout, I couldn’t catch my breath. I felt like my mind had left me. I told Ty Lue I’d be right back and ran to the locker room. I didn’t know what was happening, but I collapsed in the trainer’s room, feeling like my heart was going to explode and I couldn’t breathe. I honestly thought I was having a heart attack and that I was going to die. It was terrifying. But after I went to the hospital, everything checked out. I realized that it wasn’t something to suppress anymore. I started being honest with myself, and that freedom has given me peace. Sometimes things have to get worse before they get better, and hitting rock bottom made me realize that reaching out for help really works. For years, I suppressed my feelings because I thought that’s what I was supposed to do, especially as a man, but that’s misleading. I wish I had faced it earlier, but I believe everyone has their own moment when they’re ready to confront it. And what about LeBron during all this? He was incredibly supportive, and after the news came out, he gave me a reassuring pat on the back. Since then, others have come forward to share their own struggles, and that community has been incredibly valuable. Still, the stigma is strong, and some players will think you're soft for speaking up. But that attitude is outdated. Coming forward actually helped me, and it’s something that can help everyone, not just athletes. It’s a human issue, not just a sports issue.",Kevin Love details his battles with mental illness | ESPN,20.08.2018,ESPN,Man,20s,05:37,9,"0,9841"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJUc7Rz7QiU,Josy,"We're back with Kanye West. This is his album called ""Ye."" A beautiful photograph. You recorded this in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. You put out five other albums with other artists that you produced basically within, like, what, a month-long period of time. That's a ton of work. Are you like -- are you a workaholic? Are you always working? No, I actually slept a lot during the project. While they were recording? Yeah. I have a team, we worked together. I spent a year and a half after I got out of the hospital. I would go to Amoeba Record Store and start chopping up samples. It's very therapeutic because I wasn’t full Ye -- I don't know if I’m full Ye now, better or worse or whatever. But it was therapeutic just to listen to those songs and sample and go back to being 14 years old at my mom's house. By the time it's time to put the albums out, we have a whole team at Yeezy Sound that helps with the drums, lyrics, and choruses. I had to give like six or seven people ideas that I wanted on the song. And I'd just go to sleep and wait for them...Them working while you sleep, that's a hard worker right there. I feel like you avoided this album title. Oh, yeah, I don't -- ""I hate being bipolar, it's awesome."" I have a theory about you, tell me if this is correct. I feel you think being bipolar is part of what makes you brilliant, part of what makes you you, and you embrace it. Yeah, I think that’s another one of those things where people are like, how are you going to talk about it? The funny thing is, this is something that was on the internet before. It was kind of funny. But it’s not an opposite. It’s not ""I hate being bipolar. It’s awesome."" It actually drives more of how you really feel. It doesn’t do the opposite thing. I think it’s important for us to have conversations about mental health, especially with me being Black. We never had therapists in the Black community. We never approached taking medication. I think it's good that when I had my first complete blackout at age 5, my mom didn't fully medicate me, because I might have never been Ye. And there’s times where at least I’m happy that I know. Like, even for this interview, I knew I wanted to stay in an equal state. By the time I got to TMZ, I was ramped up. What was awesome is the world got to really experience someone in a ramped-up state. That’s when you get these comments that just shoot out, almost like Tourette’s. Because you have highs and lows. When you have a high, you’re on a roll. When you have a low, you’re not? Well, there are some cases of bipolar where people go low. I’m one that goes high. Like Michelle Obama said, go high. You don’t have extreme periods of depression? Oh, no. Because I just say it. I say it on real TV. Oh, I thought about killing myself. Then the thought is gone. So all people need to do is get on TV, that’s really the solution? They need to be able to express themselves without fear of judgment. What I love telling people is like, who do you know -- yeah, especially Black men. You know, I’m 41 years old. And I don’t know anyone, you know, that [bleep]ed up as much as I have that’s still as successful. I want to prove that you could get fat, you could say the wrong things, you can piss a whole [bleep] city off...and be president of the United States. Well -- yeah. Jimmy: There's one person.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhaMR97FgXg,Josy,"Welcome back. Well, earlier this week, NBA star Kevin Love revealed his struggle with panic attacks. As we were talking about it around the table, Carson, you shared your own experience with anxiety. Unexpectedly, too, inspired by the Kevin Love story. Something I can't change about myself. I've learned to embrace it. Hopefully, by just being honest and maybe opening up, it will inspire others to do the same. Looking back on my life, I was a worrywart kid. My father died when I was 5. I've been nervous my whole life. My first panic attack happened, and it happened when I was a host at MTV. Welcome to the show. ""Total Request Live."" The success of my career, I moved to New York and my life changed overnight. I had a hard time breathing. I was terrified for no apparent reason. At times, I feel like there's a saber-tooth tiger right here, and it's going to kill me, attack me, and bite my head off. I'm scared as if that's really happening. I went to the hospital. I have leads on my chest. I'm like, my heart is going to stop. You're perfectly fine. To this day, when I'm on television, if you watch ""The Voice"" live on NBC, watch on a Monday or Tuesday night, I'm never still. Same thing on ""Today"" Show, in the morning, some days I'm anxious. You see me. I'm fidgeting. High-pressure life. You know, on television. It has nothing to do with that. I had heightened anxiety and panic attacks at the playground with my children and wife there. And the feeling was so gripping, so terrifying, I had to leave and excuse myself. I did relaxing things, like ride my motorcycle across the country and had panic-stricken moments in that. This is the way I was born. This is the way I'm hardwired. This is the downside of the way God made me. And there's a tremendous upside, as well. I'm sensitive. I love music and music moves me in a visceral way. I get the chills when I hear certain music, like soul music. When I'm with my family and it's a euphoric moment, they resonate deeply with me. That's a flip side to a lot of that anxiety. I don't walk around a nervous wreck. I don't want people to watch this and think, ""Are you okay? Are you freaking out right now?"" No. I'm good. I'm good. People will watch this and say, ""How did he fix himself? What did he take?"" It's not that simple. What helped me was talking to a friend once, who said, ""Everything you're experiencing, I have, too."" You have anxiety. You should talk to somebody about it. Anxiety is a thing? I thought it was like stress. I opted for a cognitive therapist, someone who teaches you about anxiety, the model of it, and offers you tools on how to work through it. The muscle retention, relaxation really helps me. I'll do one now. This will help me. I'm nervous doing this interview. I'm going to clench my fists and my arm and my biceps as hard as I can, like I'm lifting a weight. Wow. That felt great. Like an ocean of relaxation. I really wear the way I am, like a badge of honor. This is who I am. And I'm proud of it. I may be a little anxious. But I know I'm going to be okay. We're so proud of you. You can hear my father talking in that. As it pertains to men's health and anxiety, that was my dad growing up. There's no such thing as stress or anxiety. As boys, we grow up like that. And anxiety and the doctor can talk about it, you feel like a little boy when you're uncomfortable having anxiety and you want your mommy, which is the antithesis of how you grew up. This is Tom. He's a licensed psychotherapist. I think Carson has done a brave thing. He comes on and does this job so well. It's also important because I think a lot of men do have that stigma. It really is. When you look at the statistics, like more women seek treatment than men. Okay. This is why you see a statistic when you hear women have more anxiety than men. That's not true. More women go and seek the treatment. The guy thing, as well. We have to push things under a rug, I'm a man. I'm having anxiety as we're talking. Literally, my heart rate is up. This is important. It's something that was great that you and people like Kevin Love can come out and say, this is relatively normal to some extent. How do you know if it's stress or if it's something more? If it's something you should speak to someone about? If it's really debilitating, and you can't sleep at night, you have a hard time functioning at work, and it's crippling you, that's the time to seek some help and have somebody to talk to. You get more women that come to my office. The men, it's a wife kicking them in. When they do, that becomes the highlight of their week. It's an outlet for them to unwind, to reframe their thinking, to understand their inner being. I think it's interesting what you said. You said, ""Does that mean I'm supposed to be on a drug? I don't want to be on drugs for the rest of my life."" You said the therapy makes a difference. I wanted to understand. If you want to fly and you're worried about it, learn about it. You're going to be nervous in the air, but you'll have a clearer understanding of how it works. Framework is everything, no matter — people are so afraid about what other people think of you. Yeah. I wish people could break down that wall, too. I guarantee you, everybody has something. Everybody. Everybody has something. It's how you deal with it. Interesting we're talking about this. I give a lot of lectures. I talk about self-esteem. What is the important word? Self. People are trying to extract attention from the outside world to fill themselves up. It doesn't work that way. We have to go within ourselves and unfold what lies deep. Wish I could open up a phone line and take all the calls. That's what the Orange Room is for. That's what people do, share. A lot of people shared with Carson, it makes a big difference. We want to put information on our website.

I kind of well, I'm feeling I'm just feeling fine like I guess that's the way I can put it I kind of I haven't been doing shit in my life because nothing's truly wrong like I'm not doing terrible But the issue is my mind right I keep on emitting myself to certain beliefs and thoughts of like I can't do this I can't do that and I've only created a whole freaking prison for myself like I don't want to be single from anymore like I know it's just not healthy whatsoever like it's not healthy to be in that like environment But I have nowhere else to go and kind of sucks because I don't know If there is anywhere else for me to go But I was thinking like as soon as I get some money soon I'm that she's gonna go to a different place like completely like not even where I'm like not even the city where I'm living Because I feel like that's anywhere and we able to change things like I don't see it as any other way um I've like things changing like actually changing after all So yeah, there's that and I kind of I don't know I know that I'm supposed to bring love to this world and bring light and like show my gifts But how am I supposed to show my gifts if I'm not being able to you know be seen or I'm like constantly You know, I wouldn't say hiding but like staying away my family's house and It's like You know at least with me last year when I was living in Wales Which was where I lived before coming back as a flambar I kind of definitely was Not really acting in my purpose, but I was still doing something that I love which is my job and You know Now being here. I kind of just got fed up and like right. This is stupid like I need to stop it so I was actually telling my mom because Have like a model of she coming up which I can still potentially go to as the London But I was actually saying to I was like listen, I might even just go to a different city because Saying here just isn't doing anything and it's not helping me and I know even if I was like You know taking that risk of being somewhere new completely At least I would get a possible chance of getting a job somewhere and Yeah, it's just I don't know because the only way I see it when me getting anywhere right now is if I got a proper job and saved up money to Move somewhere different, but anytime I've tried to get like a proper job where I live They've declined my offer. So it's like oh shit. What do I do like what can I do So yeah, there's just that and it's really frustrating, but I've always just let go and not be such and like a forcing energy and realize things happen for a reason but I'm definitely gonna try what's my phone's getting a bit wet while I'm recording this. I'm sorry I'm definitely gonna try and move somewhere different Very soon and even if it's like a big leap of faith that I have to take it's something that I will just have to take because I rather be someone you and get somewhere than be somewhere that's the same and get nowhere like It's just there's no growth.

I didn't think I could play the piano, I couldn't sing, I couldn't think critically, or make decisions like a lawyer should be able to do. And it was all, of course, imaginary because I always had those abilities; I just wasn't able to utilize them at the time. Anybody that you talked to here at Skyland Trail was pretty much familiar with your condition. It was a very personal atmosphere, and it felt good to have that support. I had had a few episodes of depression in my lifetime previously, and I had gotten treatment at several other facilities, but none of it had really been effective. But Skyland Trail’s approach was different. This particular type of therapy got me to the point where I was focusing on just living for the moment and being present for the moment, and I really think that had a lot to do with my getting well. Because now, I don't worry about the future. My plan at this point is to return to the full-time practice of law, but this time around I think I'm going to go at it a little bit differently.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70vNxk5Q8C0,Mark," Hi guys welcome back to my channel, this is your seeing my face for the first time. My name is Tasnianic Hatsi here before. You already know we all work on back my regime. So guys today we are going to be talking on how to practice self reflection. Without further ado, let's get into the video. So guys before we get into the video properly, I would like to mention that self reflection is an opportunity for you to know your strengths, know your weakness, for you to know all that concerns you and helps you to be a better person. And I thought why not is the end of the year already as I speak it is November at this point and we have like basically few days, not really few days, we have basically like a month-long to end the year. It is a good time for you to self reflect on how your life has been throughout the year. So the first thing you want to do to self reflect is to ask yourself questions. What were the good, the bad, the ugly that happened to me this year was a really happy this year. I'm going to see if I can leave the questions that you can quickly ask yourself you know for you to self reflect about your life this year. All the good things that happened, all the bad things were going to get into that later on. How did I do this year? Does that focus on my goals? All the distractions I had this year, all the things that made me you know that killed myself. This is the end of the year, even the beginning of the next year, right? You have to self reflect is really, really, very important. You can't be winging your year, year, year, year, year, year, and at the end of the day, you can't even say okay, in 2024 I improved better as a person because I did this and this and that and that's why self reflection comes in. It helps you to know how far reminisce on the things that has happened in your life. Yeah. The next one is to write down the good and the bad. All the things that really made you happy this year. That's another question you have to access self. All the things that made you sad this year, all the things that you know that oh I did so much and I was so genuinely, genuinely happy you know about the happen to me this year that made me happy that made me you know in check with myself very, very important. All the other things that made me sad you know the things that it could be anything, it could be maybe you expected something and it didn't you know happen the way you know you wanted it to happen or maybe something whatever it could be maybe a loss or something is always very, very important sit down and write like I mentioned self reflection is also something that you do in a day is something that you can actually do for weeks right. So it's always very, very, very, very important to do that and where yourself reflect don't light yourself. I will say this you can't light to anybody in this world. For you see yourself don't like to yourself don't ever like to yourself. I remember once my mom was telling me you know the answer because you do three people sorry. The answer is if we don't like to you don't like to yourself you don't like to your doctor you don't like to your therapist like she mentioned those three things you never ever like never light yourself is very, very important. So genuinely write the things that made you happy and the things that made you sad. The next one is to write three major things that really made you sad. Now the basic or the importance of doing like a self reflection is to know your short comments and the things that actually you're not really happy about that happen this year. Yeah, because it's going to make you want to do better next year. It's going to make you want to be an improved person, a better person in the next year. That's why you have to self reflect. So you have to write down those things that really, really, really made you sad. That made you you know not motivated you know made you lazy, made you know concentrate on being a better self, made you know concentrate on your goals, made you not stand all the things that you said you were going to do coming into this year. So new year resolutions, I really don't believe in your resolutions but if you do what are the things that stops you from getting those resolutions is very, very important. And when you're only sitting there you have to buy it side, say the things that contributed to it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For example, let's say you were in a relationship and you, the relationship ended. Why did it end? Was it because the person wasn't a good person? Was it because you were in a good person? It's very, very important and it's very important for you to know that the good and the bad you have a contribution in it. Now if someone did you wrong for a very long time and at the end of the day maybe you broke up with the person or you left the person. Now where your own contribution comes in is the fact that you sat there for so long before you like picked up a like okay I'm not doing this anymore. That is your own contribution. It's always very important to always understand that it takes through to tango. It takes through to tango. So to know what it is, it could be that you lose guard, it could be that you know you dropped your self-esteem wasn't you know as high. It's not you don't beat yourself for the things that contributed for the things that didn't go on well. It's just for you not to do it again. Yeah. It's just for you not to do it again. So you have to be real with yourself. Sit down over the things that I did that contributed to me not focusing on my goal in 2024. Was I lazy? Was that passing a lot? Was I going out? Was I feeling all motivated? Was I feeling like oh I can't do this was in my self-esteem? You have to miss them. You have to know them. Very important. If you are not the right person, say to your head and answer yourself in your head. Very very key. Yeah. Next one is to think about the good things that happen and be grateful for them. Inasmuch as I said that reflection is so that you think about the bad things that happen to you. You know how to be better person. You also have to think about the good. Let me tell you something. Your life is not as bad as it seems. Yeah. The only reason why you think your life is bad or your life is not what you want it to be is because you complain yourself to another person or because you have a dream and you want that dream now, now, now. You don't want to go through the process. That's like the tree is. To think about the things that happen, one major thing I think we all take for granted is the fact that we clocked a year or that every year or all of us clocked a year or that this year is something that we do not read so much like clocked a year in good health. I remember one time. I was sick and it was my birthday. I can never, ever, ever forget that day. I can, I can not forget it. Now, it is not you know saying that okay, something bad has to happen to you before you. You'll be able to cherish that you get older. Forgetting older is a gift. We need to stop making a look at it. The battery is a gift. Some people pass the way very young. Some they will leave up to your age and some did your age and they've gone and you are working up to another year to live another to clock another age. So if you don't have anything to be grateful for, you'll be in a year older in good health. Very, very, very important. So think about the good things that happen. Be grateful for them. Very, very, very key. So these things is very, very important. Think about your family. Complete. You do have to go as I say over and you want to see it. Because that's on the other side. We need to start giving little things. That's very important. Then the last one is to set goals. Now this will help you and guide you to the next year. After reflecting, you're ready to know things that will, will, how you work to understand for it's goal well, those things that didn't go well, how you contribute it, please, for it not to go well. Now you need to set new goals for yourself for the next year. Like I said, you can't be a winging, be a like, a bison, you can't be doing that because honestly, what's your purpose of life if you're doing that? It's always very important. Set a goal for yourself. Very, very, very key. This is also going to help you not to go back into the pattern that you're trying to run away from. Like I said, way list the bad things, all the things that you contribute for that thing to actually be bad. And to make you know, go back to the thing where you set new goals. Oh, I want you to do this. I want to start a business. What is that thing that you have to do to start the business? You have to list it and do the work. You have to do the work. In case nobody's telling you, I'm telling you, you have to do the work. Nothing is going to happen without work. Nothing. Nothing is going to happen. If you want to start a business, if you want a nine to five, if you want to work from home, whatever it may be, if you do not put in the work, it is not going to happen. Like there's no how you want to do. There's no brainer. It's not going to happen. So you have to be meaning to put in the work and you have to tell yourself that you have to put in the work. Don't go into the air and just there. I know it can be so overwhelming. You know, new and new and new. Don't want to do now. Take your time. You might not start in January. Starts a February. You might not start a February start in March. I think before the first quarter is over. You already know what you want to do for the new year. Yeah. So guys, we've come to the end of this video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOq2ngwYR5Q,Mark," Hello, so first of all I would like to introduce myself. I am Pachali Nata Wong or May. Today I am going to reflect upon my recently completed group project where we were supposed to work on a roleplay focused on negotiation and how to manage a conflict of interest. We did the presentation the other day and most parts turned out pretty good. Apart from the roleplay was mainly a discussion instead of negotiation. However, all of us did quite well, I would say. And we did try our best so I would like to share with you what I took from working with my team, the challenges we faced, and some new skills developed along the way. For benefits of collaboration, working with my team became quite insightful, I would say. I think one of the biggest advantages of collaboration was that I got to see things from different angles. Each person had a unique approach to negotiation and we were able to combine our different perspectives. It was kind of intriguing to see how each of us handled the conflict and then worked our way toward a solution that could benefit everyone. We had a good brainstorming sessions and I felt like we were constantly building on each other's ideas. Next for challenges encountered. Of course, everyone would encounter challenges. For us, we faced a few challenges along the way. One of the biggest problems I think it was scheduling with all of us having different commitments, such as final exams coming up soon, and a lot of work to do continuously. So it was hard to find time to meet. We had to overcome it by being flexible and trying to find ways to communicate effectively. There were also some instances where there was some conflict over our roles or how to approach certain parts of the negotiation. But I really think that helped us grow as a team. We learned to compromise and respect each other's ideas, ultimately strengthening our project. Next, new knowledge or skills gained. This project taught me a lot. Definitely, I improved my negotiation skills a bit, but also I learned some new strategies having looked at my teammates. Working through challenges together also taught me more about problem solving in a group setting. I realized that it is important to listen and support other people's ideas and become more adaptive in my approach to teamwork. For personal growth and teamwork, looking back now, I think the project helped me mature a bit. I really got to become a better team player and grew in appreciation of collaboration and mutual respect, especially when dealing with conflicts. Generally speaking, it was a good experience and I am much more confident about handling similar problems in the future. To conclude, I am very thankful. Thank you for listening to my reflection. This project was a great learning experience both in building teamwork and acquiring confidence in the management of conflict situations. Through working with my team, I learned how important, clear communication, patience and respect for other people's perspectives are. I look forward to applying what I have learned in other group settings and projects. Thanks again for watching. Bye bye.",Self Reflection VDO,14.11.2024,putcharee nuntawong,Woman,20s,5:05,8,"0,9983"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItdEedWdf0U,Wentao,I am Vivian Smith I've worked at the University of Strathclyde in the Department of Education and I'm really interested in literacy and how the messages we give children about reading from the very beginning influence the way they develop as readers if we get early reading right there will be more children who are prepared to read and do well in school all sorts of wonderful things happen if you read your vocabulary increases your ability to use language increases your range of ideas increases or general knowledge increases all of that is important another thing that reading will be silly though if not just increase your ability to learn the effect could increase your mental well-being one of the things we all know that reading does for us is it gives us a space away from the real world and that's important children feel experiencing stress for every room can use reading of that breakout space that we break where they don't have to worry about whatever it is that growing if you think about a fairy tale where magic might happen or up which is a which might appear or a giant or a wicked stepmother the child who reads those know that that isn't real but it gives them another way of looking at life and if you can say okay that world is not quite like my world you can then say well what if my world was different so if reading is presenting an alternative way of seeing reality a suggestion there might be other ways of doing another thing that's important is that reading helps children understand their own life and there are lots of lovely picture books about real children who have real emotional crises and I don't really think it might be just realizing that another girl in your class has the same dress on you but actually reading and seeing that other people have the same emotions of you the same experiences you it's very important for children very important for everyone because it makes you understand you're not alone in the world even more incessant breathing teaches you empathy so you don't just see your own world you see something else's and you learn that other people have other ways of thinking other problems other ways of dealing with them and we need that the new children to be able to see the world from other people's perspective [Music] ,How reading supports mental wellbeing,18.07.2017,Vivienne Smith,Woman,50s,02:46,6,"0,9725"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW-qtXaWzvM,Wentao,hi my name is Marissa Robinson and I'm a psychotherapist and today I want to talk to you about spiritual Wellness so I first want to start with some definitions because I think I didn't know what spiritual Wellness was before before learning more about it so when I think about spiritual Wellness I think of a higher sense of purpose meaning value in your life meeting your own needs exploring and feeling connected to your authentic self and the world around you also participating in activities that are consistent with your beliefs and your values we'll go more into all of that a myth about spiritual Wellness is that we need religion in order to be spiritual so I think when I think about religion I think about it as a support to your spiritual Wellness so after we've taken time to explore our spiritual Wellness to look inwards and kind of explore what our meaning in life is meeting our own needs what those needs are our values and beliefs we are able to see where we rely align maybe a religion really expresses these values and beliefs in a way that feel true to you and so joining that religious house or religion can help you feel more supported in the community but you certainly don't have to be religious in order to be spiritual in fact I believe that my spirituality is more about me is more about connecting to who I am and living in a way that feels authentic to me that doesn't mean I'm not religious but that doesn't but in my mind spiritual Wellness is more about me being connected to me me being connected to people around me that um align with my beliefs values and meanings and that I also am connected to the outside world and world around me so how does spiritual Wellness relate to your mental health when I think about it I think about the word authenticity I think we heard a lot about that in my definition of spiritual Wellness when I think about spiritual illness I think about meeting your own needs feeling um noticing what your needs are and being able to express your authentic self in a way that lives that you live in a true and honest way so when I think about spiritual Wellness I think about honing into your authentic self um also spiritual Wellness can decrease your Stress and Anxiety one way that you can kind of live in a spiritual way is by meditating by having quiet time by embracing the silence and Solitude and that can be a decrease in your stress and anxiety in turn it can increase your self-esteem and confidence because you're embracing this authenticity you're living in a way that is true to you and in that it feels like you're capable you're confident you don't need to rely on anyone else or compare yourself you're kind of on your own path and that is how it can increase your self-esteem and confidence another way is I think I mentioned this in the definition is that you feel connected with the relationship with yourself you feel like you have positive and healthy relationships with others and have a positive relationship with the world around you in your environment often when we are living in an authentic way we probably aren't engaging in relationships that feel toxic or not right or hurtful to us we're normally engaging in relationships that be all really good and healthy to us as well as feel like our space is clean that we live in a space that feels good and calm for us so that can be some things that you normally find when you're embracing yourself your spiritual Wellness as well there's also a sense of acceptance you accept yourself and those around you and it's not once again that comparing or living in societal Norms you're really connecting to yourself and living a way that feels true to you so with that how do we improve our spiritual Wellness I'm going to give you an example when I feel the most connected to myself um and I'm embracing my spiritual Wellness I normally feel a sense of grounded connection and feel like the fullest version of myself and I started to wonder and I want you to do the same of when you do feel that sense of connection groundedness and feel full when I feel that way I think about my running path back home and I think about when it is just a flat Road ingrained in nature and it just kind of goes and I'm jogging and normally I listen to music when I jog but here I don't I just listen to the nature sounds I notice my emotions I allow myself just to explore what myself my authentic self is saying what I need any beliefs and values I have what it feels like to be in this authentic space and then I start to notice one other one what other ways I feel like that when I like I do when I'm running and I start to notice when I'm with this friend I feel this way when I'm by myself meditating I feel this way when I'm in the therapy room I feel this way and then you can kind of pick out when you're really feeling authentic so that's a way that I explore my spiritual Wellness is when I feel my most grounded connected and fullest and then it gives you permission to explore your personal values and your higher purpose in life I want us to dedicate a quiet time where you feel like you can be your most grounded fullest version of yourself so that you can explore these questions too I know that feels a little daunting but most of the time when you are grounded and feeling good and that you can just be with you is times where you might find those answers and surprise yourself so I want you to dedicate it's quiet time and create a routine of this this can be a minute this can be an hour this can be 10 minutes within your day it doesn't have to look any certain way it just feels right it feels true and most times you would have to embrace the silence and Solitude just because you're alone does not mean that you're lonely it means that you're actually just allowing yourself to be with you so you can ask yourself these questions so I want that's some ways to improve your mental and um how it relates to your mental health and how you can improve your spiritual Wellness so before Beyond I want us just to take a time take a moment to kind of embrace that silence and Solitude most often um when I'm just practicing this in my daily routine and even if it's just for a minute in between therapy sessions I could take a moment to close my eyes I put one hand on my heart one hand on my belly and take a breath so I'm going to invite you to do this with me now let's just take a moment and breathe in through our nose exhale out through her mouth and I want you to repeat that just a few times and check in with your body reconnect with your authentic self and ask yourself these questions about your spiritual health uh thank you so much for joining

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6DJxfOQecw,Andre,"What's going on guys, thanks so much for watching my Meishan video, and this is gonna be kind of the part of the video where I go into exactly how I did it, and this video is really gonna be aimed for the people who have been trying to take off the weight and just haven’t been able to do it and feel like failures because of it, thinking it's their fault or their willpower that can't get them this, and I’m just an average guy, I’m a junior in college, not a D1 athlete or scholar, just a normal guy who figured out how to make it happen after years of failure, so I’ll go into some main details on how I was able to do it; first thing is diet—when it comes to diet, the only numerical term I want to mention is being in a calorie deficit; you’ve got a point where you’re gonna maintain, put on weight, or lose weight if you're under that maintenance level, it’s that simple, I’m not gonna talk about macros, keeping it realistic here, you’ve got to be in a deficit, that’s all, whether large or small, you’re gonna lose weight just might be faster or slower depending on how aggressive the deficit is, but you’ve got to sustain it; eat what you enjoy, I ate what I liked the entire time, no need for diets, they set you up for failure, cheat meals are just a socially acceptable way of binging; if your friends are having pizza, have a slice, it’s okay, but remember to go right back to your routine, have the choice to say it’s more important to stick to your plan, and make sure you’re in a deficit, track it using MyFitnessPal or whatever works for you; next point is exercise, for me, almost all of it was cardio because I was so focused on weight loss, I wasn’t concerned with weightlifting at the time, but I got back into it later; during weight loss, I focused on cardio and circuit training, doing what I enjoyed, like swimming and the Stairmaster, not running, don’t make cardio a punishment, make it something you enjoy, put on a great album, watch your favorite show; my personal cardio regimen now is 45 minutes a day of either Stairmaster or swimming or circuit training, that’s what keeps me lean and happy; to wrap this up, the key points that made this weight loss transformation successful were: 1) What is your why? Establish why you want to lose weight and make it important enough to get up early or do what it takes; 2) Set small goals to stay focused and accountable, hitting short-term goals builds momentum toward the long-term goal; 3) Trust the process, once you know what you need to do and stick to it, trust it will work; 4) This is not a diet, it’s a lifestyle change, make it something you enjoy so it becomes a habit; 5) No black-and-white thinking—don’t strive for perfection, allow yourself breaks when needed, just stay on track the next day; thanks for watching, smash that like and subscribe button, and share with your friends if you got something out of this, more content coming soon, until then, keep grinding.",12 Week Weight Loss Journey | Tips and Tricks,26.12.2018,Jackson Desjardins,man,20,09:26,10,"0,9966"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=885WJodCXwc,Andre,"Over the past two and a half years, I’ve spent 2,000 hours meditating in an effort to master my inner world and overcome anxiety, so in this sort of journal entry of a video, I invite you to sit back and relax while I sort of recap my experience of meditating and get a sense of what I’ve learned through this life-transforming process; spoiler alert: it is not what you would expect. To tell this story so far, let’s go back to 2019—I was working as a cardiac technician, fresh out of university, having graduated with a biomedical science degree; I was training at the gym, looked my best, had a beautiful girlfriend, so on the surface everything was going well, but under the hood, not so much. I was dealing with tremendous amounts of anxiety, playing video games upwards of 10 hours per day to mask that underlying discomfort; I would socially isolate myself and feel exhausted after work, so while things looked good externally, internally it was a completely different story. Enter Tim Ferriss and Sam Harris, whose insights led me to try meditation; starting with five-minute bursts, I found a sort of relief I hadn’t experienced before, fueled by internal investigation rather than numbing discomfort with external solutions. It felt like an operation on my mind, uncovering self-limiting beliefs that had been unconsciously driving my reactions and suffering. Motivated by this clarity, I increased to 20-30 minutes of meditation per day, despite moments of frustration, because the relief from anxiety was undeniable. This led me to my first 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat, where I learned body scanning and began deconstructing deeply held thought patterns, seeing sensations as transient and gaining objectivity. This clarity brought immense relief from suffering and motivated me to adopt two hours of daily practice, aiming to uproot suffering permanently. With consistent practice, I noticed improvements in daily life, becoming more present and detached from difficult mental states while appreciating small moments. However, meditation also brought challenges; deep practice surfaced repressed memories and traumas, forcing me to confront difficult material that, at times, overwhelmed me. Meditation, when taken seriously, is not about bliss but rigorous self-investigation that can feel like shredding old beliefs, which sometimes felt destabilizing. While meditation offered liberating insights and glimpses of freedom, it also required balancing engagement with the world and laying a healthy psychological foundation. Today, meditation remains my top priority; supported by a teacher and consistent practice, it permeates every moment, transforming my perspective and making it clear that I have everything I need within me and that I’m completely okay.",I Meditated 2 Hours Daily For 2.5 Years - Honest Reflections.,19.07.2021,Sam Roff,man,20,09:41,10,"0,9888"

I'm tired of feeling like I'm putting my all into everything I do practically. Everything I do I put my all into and you know it might not be the outcome that's expected or the outcome that some people might want. But I believe the effort is everything. If someone is not putting in the same effort as you, then that's where shit gets a little messy because everyone wants to be appreciated. Everyone wants to feel like they're doing something right. There's no like, there's no right or wrong way to do things. I don't know who, what upper power there is to tell us and reassure us that we're doing everything the way we're supposed to. It's all in our heads, you know, we put pressure on ourselves to feel like we're doing things right. There's a lot of distracting stories out there that make you feel like you need to be doing better or you know that you're just not on the same par or page as other people. We all grow up in different ways. We all grow up differently. So I believe it's really just unlearning what you've been conditioned to learn and what you're conditioned to being used to. So me saying that I hate my life is just me saying that I'm done with being who I am. I'm done with my lifestyle and my way of thinking. You know, I'm not, I do create excuses. I'm not going to say I never create excuses, but I don't think I create the most excuses from what I've experienced. I've experienced people that have way more excuses in their life and they let that dictate their decisions. And I really, I really try not to make excuses, but at this point in my life, you know, it's part of, it's part of my lifestyle and I don't want it to be anymore. Not only with myself, but with other people. So it takes acknowledgement. It takes reassuring yourself because if you depend on reassurance from other people, it's just not going to, it's not going to hit you as deep. It's not going to resonate with you. It has to be with yourself. It has to be within yourself in order for you to get hit by other waves. The ocean inside of you needs to be managed in calm. You need to manage your own waves in order for you to be able to witness any other waves in your life and actually be able to navigate them and go about life without setting yourself back or feeling left like this. I feel very, very upset. I'm very upset. I just stopped crying and I'm like, well, what can I do? I can talk to myself. I can sit here and talk my way out of it because I don't know what else to do. It's, it's a very lonely world out there. We're all disconnected and even the connections you have with maybe your friends or boyfriend, girlfriend, whoever it is that you are connected to, even that connection might not feel as connected as you want it to be because we're all disconnected. They want us all to be disconnected from our families, from our significant others, our children. The only thing we're really connected to is our phones and it's so sad to feel like I hate my life and I don't. I'm so grateful for my life. I'm so grateful for waking up and being able to do whatever I want to do. I'm thankful for breathing. I'm thankful for being able to create this video in general. But it's sad for me to say that I do hate my life because I don't and I want to access that part of my brain that feels that way. It's so hard to manage my waves. My waves are not calm right now and that's okay because I acknowledge it and I want it to pass. I want these waves to pass and I want to calm myself in order to navigate the world. I have to navigate myself and I'm choosing to talk because talking just lets it out to me and helps me acknowledge it. So if anyone else is feeling this way, I really hope that you can put it in yourself and not put it out into the world because it's not the world's fault. The world is just going along without you. Time will continue with or without you. So everything you feel is internal. It's your internal thoughts. It's the waves inside of you and if you can't control that, then the world will get you. It will make you feel like you hate your life because you're not focused on your waves. You're focused on all the other waves coming at you and that's a very dangerous way of thinking because you might drown. You might actually drown. You might actually let it take you because you're weak inside and you won't let yourself come out. So that's it. That's all I got to say. I hope this can help other people. I get to help to meet a little bit. It takes a little more than just talking at this point because it takes action and it takes accountability in myself and that's what I plan on doing for the rest of my life. It is an ongoing and everlasting commitment but I don't want to happen. You regret it my life. So that's that.",I hate my life,22.02.2024,Keira Lhotan,woman,20s,7:13,8,"0,8651"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTAhsV7Ml8I,Josy," So, basically my whole entire life, aside from elementary school, I've never had friends. In elementary school, I had a few friends, but after that, I literally never had friends. I've never had a group of friends that I hung out with. Consistently, I don't have friends that I call or text or hang out with. I have acquaintances that I see at school and work and now in college, but I do not have any friends. And when I say this or when I have had to say this, people usually laugh. And I think it's either A, because they think it's a funny joke that I've made, or be they're uncomfortable by the thought of that. Saying that you don't have friends has become a joke. It's like the butt of the joke. Oh, I don't have friends home. The jellies are here, I don't need. But when I say I don't have friends, I mean I genuinely do not have one single friend that I can call up and hang out with and just do friend things with. Like I don't have friends, I've never had friends. Now that we get that out of the way, I don't appreciate the stigma around not having friends. You know, I feel like, well, first of all, we're taught to be social. We live in a society that rewards, extroverts. It rewards people who are extremely social and outgoing. And I am none of those things. I am extremely introverted. And growing up, I thought there was actually something wrong with me. I felt bad about myself because I didn't understand why I couldn't go socialize like everyone else did because I just had this feeling of absolute drain and exhaustion anytime that I tried and I just didn't understand why that happened to me. But over the years and especially within the past two years or so, I've really come to understand why I am this way. And I think it's important if you don't have any friends to understand why you are the way you are. For me, I am not shy. I don't have social anxiety. I don't have any sort of fear of people or talking to people. I am just very, very, very introverted. And I find peace in being alone. It's when I feel the most energized and the most like myself. I need to be alone in order to function properly. And even going out for a night can just exhaust the absolute shit out of me. And I've learned that. I've learned that there is nothing wrong with me and that this is truly just the way that I am. And I'm at a point where I'm able to embrace that now. And I love being alone more than anything. So A, try your best to figure out why that is the case. Because there's a difference between not having friends and, you know, keeping it that way because you're happiest and not having friends because of something like social anxiety or, you know, just general fears. It can be unhealthy, but it doesn't have to be. And in my case, it's definitely not unhealthy. But yeah, I think that not having friends needs to be normalized. If you don't have any friends like me, don't feel bad. It's easier said than done. But there's truly nothing wrong with it. Again, we do live in a society that rewards people for their extraversion and... This dude's just absolutely blasting my music through the gym parking lot. I'm sorry, but... Oh, I got off track. Alright, basically, if you don't have friends, take it from me. I have literally not had friends practically my entire 19 years of living for the most part. And I am introverted. I know myself very well and I am happy and you don't need friends to be happy. If that is something that makes you happy, if you find joy and you gain energy from those social interactions and parties and small talk and just gathering together with people, like you do it, do you? But this video is just for people who don't have any friends. Because I wish I had someone to tell me when I was younger, hey, there is literally nothing wrong with you. You are just not an extrovert and you enjoy being alone. It was like it was so hard for me to look around and just see everyone else having friends, you know, at school, all that. And then me being the kid alone, thinking, wow, no one likes me, there is something wrong with me, blah, blah, blah. But I was super young, I mean. What do you expect? But now that I know myself much better, I know that there is certainly nothing wrong with me and there is nothing wrong with you either. You are perfect the way you are. And if it is something deeper, I guess, if it is like social anxiety or you have fears of being rejected or, you know, if you want friends and don't have them, those are always things that you can find support for and work on and change and get better. But if you don't have friends and you are okay with it, you are not alone and I just want to remind you that there is nothing wrong with you, be you. And you know, I would say that all of us with no friends could like come be friends. But I think I'm good, you know what I mean? I think I'm showing, but yeah, that's all I have to say. Just a rant about being a friendless human. Yeah. I like to stay busy and I like to work on myself and I really, really, really enjoy quiet, just piece silence. And that makes me happy, so. Yeah. Don't worry. Don't worry about it.",why I have no friends at 19,17.09.2021,bri,woman,20s,7:54,8,"0,9993"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-xdlsDwIqM,Josy," Hey guys, I hope everyone's doing well. Today's video is about male loneliness. In advance, I want to apologize about the shinginess of the camera. And guys, today's video is like I mentioned about loneliness. It's hard because you go around people, you follow the advice of you just got to go out there and make friends and approach people. And you notice that a lot of the people, you know, they make you feel unwelcomed, you know, their body language says it, their behavior says it. And as men we're seen as predators as bad guys, just because a small number of ended it. But you know, you say anything could be said about the small number of women, the small number of whatever group you mention can be said as well that there's, you know, small, you know, percentage doing bad stuff. But it's tough and it's memorializing once you deal with that stuff, you don't want to approach people anymore. And one of the things I found out is that you could live with that thought, but in the end, you can't wallow in your own negativity and your own thoughts that are just going to harm you. And one of the things I've noticed that helps me is help people unconditionally. Don't help people with expecting something in their turn. You know, after a while, you're going to start seeing how these people, you know, they're seeing how dependable you are, how great you are at helping them. And that gets you out of the rut, believe it or not, in time. You know, you start seeing how other people treasure the things you do for them. And you slowly get out of there. It does take time. But one of the things you want to go ahead and just keep in mind is that I think there's more good people, more people that are rational and irrational that, you know, think, oh my gosh, it's, you know, sometimes I feel like a bear. Like, oh my gosh, it's a bear. You know, I feel like if people see me as a bear because, you know, they think I'm going to, you know, eliminate them. And that's not true. That's not, that's, you know, and sometimes you feel like, I'm like, man, am I a bear? That people just don't want to be around me, you know, and it's, and it's exhausting, you know? And once you deal with that enough, you don't want to deal with it anymore. And then you just isolate yourself. And, but you hear yourself in, in the end, I mean, just with your thoughts, those things are just destructive of the negativity that you think. So what I do is I just say, you know what, the opinion that matters is my opinion. And nobody else's, you know, at the end of the day, who's a pinion do you want? Do you want to go by somebody that you're not, that's never going to like you or even your own negativity that's always going to be going against you? Why not just live by your own self-asset, you got to build up your self-esteem. That way you could defend yourself when all these negative awful thoughts just come in through your head. And that's all you can do. Just live day by day. But I want to go and just keep it short, guys. Take it easy.",I feel so lonely☹,21.01.2024,AZrakoon,Man,30s,3:01,7,"-0,8902"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1n0Uc0GUsE,Josy," Hey guys, how's it going? Guys, thank you so much for all your time, your comments. I really appreciate it guys. I'm really made of motivates me to do these videos. Thank you guys today's topic I want to cover failure. So failure, we love what ourselves goals, we didn't accomplish something, we feel bummed out, we feel all these negative emotions and we say, you know, I'm never going to accomplish anything. If I can't even accomplish this, I said by age 25, I'm going to be here, but I'm not. And you say, look at this person, they're already there. You know, I'm not here and they're, and we're at the same age, we started off at the same point. And the truth is, you're going to hurt yourself just comparing yourself to others. So that's not the, so that is a bad thing to do to yourself. The thing is, you know, we all have advantages and disadvantages and there's certain circumstances in life that just didn't permit us to go forward. And the thing is, you know, there's no, you shouldn't set yourself in timeline necessarily. Perhaps the goal is it going to take you a while? Yes. But you shouldn't be really bumming yourself out over small failures. You know, failure is going to happen no matter what. Even the successful people that you're seeing, they failed. They're going to fail until you succeed. That's the truth. And the thing is that, that you got to start off with small goals. You got to, sure, there's a big picture, right? But you got to say, okay, I'm going to need to start off here, here, here, here, here. For example, you know, I was watching this guy called Healthy Gamer, Dr. K. Great video. I'm going to put it on the link below. So guys, I want to go ahead and say that he says start off with small goals. So you want to eat healthy? That's the goal. So he said, you know, maybe you said, I'm going to eat healthy three times a day, but you could only eat one. And you bum yourself out. I think I might be off a little bit on what he said in the video, but he said that start off small just once, eat healthy for one day a week. Then after a while, you're going to say, hey, I'm eating I ate three times, I ate three days healthy this week. Let's go ahead and shoot for three in next week. He said, no, scale it back a little bit. It's hard. Put yourself at two for next week. And then after a while, it's going to get easier and easier and easier. And then you're going to, in your mind, it's going to start saying, hey, look, I'm accomplishing these goals. You know, and after a while, you're going to start seeing, you know, an avalanche of successes. And the same thing applies not just for healthy eating, but other goals, you know, financial and maybe in school. You know, for example, I knew a guy that got his engineering degree and he started off in pre-algebra and community college and little by little, he put effort and sure, it took him, I think like four or five years just to get to differential, calculus. So the thing is, it's true. It's going to take you a while to get to a certain point. But the truth is, you got to start off small until you start seeing the bigger successes. So don't bum yourself out, don't compare yourself. You know, be your own cheerleader. Be your own nurture. So guys, I want to go ahead and keep it there. I'll see you in the next video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KAzru4gxhQ,Josy," It is November 4th, 2024, and I'm 24 years old. Being 24 is kind of weird. On one side, I have these middle-aged Korean guys telling me that I'm so young and that I have time. And on the other side, I have my Sunday school, high school students calling me a nunk already. In the middle, people my age well, we're all over the place. Some people are graduating and getting adult jobs, some are getting engaged. Two months ago, I went to my first wedding where somebody two years younger than me was getting married and that was kind of trippy. And then there's other people that are still hanging on to those last drops of the early 20s. Still posting stories on staff chat of all places. I like to ask old people what age they would like to return to. To my surprise, none of them said that it was their 20s. Most of them said that it was their 30s. They said it's because their 20s was filled with too much uncertainty. And I think that's pretty accurate. I think I've made about 100 different life plans. Plans like, oh, I'm definitely going to marry this person or this person is definitely going to be a lifelong friend or... I'm going to be living here in two years or I'm going to be doing this with my business in one year, etc. And just about 100% of those things have not gone according to plan. There's this Bible verse that I've been reflecting on. It's James chapter 4, verse 13 to 15. It reads, Come now you who say, today or tomorrow, we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there doing business and making money. Yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, if the Lord wishes, we will live and do this or that. That's humbling. Who in mind to say that I'm going to be doing this and that, definitely? But it's also encouraging knowing that there's a God out there that has plans that are beyond me. So I'm making this video kind of like a time capsule. That at 24 years old, so far, nothing has gone according to plan. But that right now, I'm excited and that I trust God's plan. What amazing plan does he have for me that he's throwing all of my plans out the window for? And I pray that God helps me and you find certainty through our uncertainty.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruCRUKZHqBM,Josy," It's okay to not be okay. You over here, you hate people say, is everything gonna be okay? Am I gonna be okay? Are you gonna be okay? Are they gonna be okay? The answer is no. I'm not gonna be okay. You're not gonna be okay. Everything is not gonna be okay. But that's okay. The way I look at it is how you look at things, how you perceive things, how you look at life in the current situation that you're in or situations. I look at things as either a lesson or a blessing. If someone talks badly behind my back or just talks badly about me or backstabs me in any type of way, am I gonna feel okay about it? No. I'm not gonna feel okay. But that's fine though. Obviously that person wasn't meant to bring me up in life and I'm obviously not gonna let them bring me down. Therefore, I'm gonna use them as a lesson to help me keep moving forward in my life. So they don't affect me. Don't focus on the bad things or the pessimistic things. Don't surround yourself with negative thoughts and emotions after you have gone through something like this. Because life is moving on. And if you don't move on with life it's gonna move on without you. And that's gonna set you back a ton before you even know it. And another thing about life is it's not meant to be okay. You're meant to have those. If you didn't have lows, then you wouldn't have highs. There's gonna be times where you're gonna feel like nothing's gonna change. Your life is just gonna get worse. There's not gonna be any ways for you to heal. But when you feel that type of way, when you are feeling that way, you have to learn to appreciate the lows so you can enjoy the highs. Learn to enjoy the highs that you've had and will have. For example, if you sick and you've had, you've got a stuffy nose and a headache, you sit in there, sitting there thinking, damn, like I wish I was outside right now breathing in that fresh air plant bowl outside on my street. But I bet you, when you wasn't sick, you didn't even think about that fresh air. You didn't think about the bowl on the street like you were about to play, like you didn't think about any of that. When you are at your highest, you have nothing to do with those lows. You don't even think about the lows. When you're at your lowest, all you think about is the highs. Learn to appreciate the lows so you can enjoy the highs. Without being at your lowest, you won't have a high. Without being at your highest, you won't have a low. I've learned so many things from being at my lowest and the best things that have happened to me in my life were from being at my lowest. I've lost this many fake friends from while I was at my lowest. But I gained positivity and energy that I can maintain to get to my highest. I lost all these people, but obviously, if I lost them, they weren't meant to bring me up. They weren't meant to keep me going. And now, all of a sudden, I'm at my highest. Now, these things may not correlate to you in any type of way, or anything like that. But now, I'm here to tell you that life is going to get better. But life is also going to get worse. What is, what value does life have if you just stand on one level the entire time? Life is just going to go up. You're going to be at your highest and eventually, you're just going to go right back down. Life is going to be amazing. Then you're going to be at your lowest again right before you know it. If everything in life was good and sweet, there wouldn't be no appreciation. But if everything was bad, there wouldn't be no enjoyment. You have to find that balance and appreciate the lowest so you can enjoy the highs. So when either of them hits you in the face, you aren't overwhelmed with it and you're able to maintain it. And make good things out of it. So at the end of the day, it's okay not to be okay. Life is going to get better. Life is just going to get worse. But then it's going to get better again. Then it's going to get worse again, like a rollercoaster. In the end, it's how you look at those things. It's how you look at the bad things and the good things, and how you deal with them, and how you let them affect you and help you move forward until where you want to be next. Remember, there is no purpose in life if you were just up here the whole time. Those lows mean something, just like those highs mean something. Learn from those lows and appreciate them so you can enjoy the highs even more. Now I appreciate you after listening and if you're still here, thank you for still being here. I'll see you on the next one.",It’s okay to not be okay.,16.11.2024,Jacob Perez,Man,20s,4:42,8,"0,9967"

During this time where we stay home and we be with our families, I have felt so many different things. And maybe you read my little video about wild feelings last week, but some of the things I've been feeling are happy. I love staying home with my family. I love having extra time with Jayny and getting to see her learn and help her and kind of learn what she does at school. That's been really fun. So happy. I have felt really sad because I really miss my kindergartners. And I wish I could see them and I wish that I could teach like normal because I don't really like talking to myself in front of my computer because nobody talks back to me and it's kind of boring and it makes me sad. So I'm gonna draw a sad face. Okay, I have felt tired. Okay, I'll draw sleeping. Okay. So I've got myself sleepy. I don't know if you guys have felt sleepy, but sometimes I just feel like I don't have that much energy like I usually do. And then let's see here. I have felt crazy. So I'm just gonna make myself like looking crazy. Like wild crazy like ah. First crazy. And then I have felt mad. Sometimes it's really frustrating and angry when I'm trying to do work and there's all of my family running around my house. It's really hard right now and all by myself. So, yeah, sometimes I do feel mad. But right now I feel pretty happy. So anyways, you can see here that I have felt a lot of different feelings. Okay, hopefully you guys have felt a lot of different feelings too and like this is normal. SJanie has been writing her bike with training wheels. She really wants to turn the wheels off, but she's a little bit slow on the wheels right now. So anyways, she's upstairs. But she's gotten so much more confident at writing her bike and she's happy and she's excited. She used to be a little bit afraid. So it's been really cool to see her grow as a bike rider. So that is one magical moment that I got to experience with Janie one day and it was during lunch. So usually at lunch I don't get to go bike writing with Janie. So on this particular day, we took our lunch outside and we ate it by outside on our deck. And then we went for a bike ride. So here she is, she's on her bike and her tricycle, well, not tricycle, bike with training wheels on it.So that is my magical moment and I'm gonna label this watching Janie grow, her cadence on her bike. That's been really fun. So if you don't have a page like this at home, you can just simply at the top write one word that inspires you. I'm gonna get this marker. I have code one word that inspires you. You can draw five different circles and add almost like an emoji, what you've been feeling. And then a magical moment that's happened to you recently. And then right here it says time stamp, make an inspirational message and put it in a neighbor's mailbox. It would be really fun to do. I think I'm gonna write a message to my neighbor that says, be happy, go outside and enjoy the fresh air or something like that. So anyways, that's it for today friends.

I just got back from a business training and it was really good. But now it's time. So I'm gonna open my letter and I'm really nervous. A little rundown December 18 last year. I believe it was a Friday. I was going through a lot. It was about to be Christmas and yeah, I was going through a very hard time in my life. My boyfriend at the time, like, broke up with me and I really like... It was just a messy breakup. It was very heartbreaking. I wrote this letter to myself, to my future self, so that I could see how far I've come. Not only that, but I kind of explained in my other video on Instagram that this is like a little prayer. Just me writing down. Kind of like what's going on in my life and like what I want to see, where I want to see myself in a year. I actually wrote a letter to myself in seventh grade and my teacher milled it back to me. Right when I graduated, I received it in the mill around like August time, I believe. I got to open it and read it and see who I wanted to be at that time. Me a year ago is completely different than me today. I'm very thankful for the growth because it was super hard to go through that. I'm just going to read it. I'm going to talk at the end. Yeah. I'll probably cut out some parts that are like if it's too much or it's going to like expose or do whatever company's need. Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous. So... It's three pages long. Oh my gosh, where am I going to cry? Okay, this is December. Okay. Oh my gosh. Okay. Dear Joe, this year has been crazy. You graduated. You quit sound. You quit show choir. You stepped down from impact club. You led the worship team. You preached. You even got to make a lot of new friends through a pandemic. Hello, well. Also, you didn't get corona. Yay. You went through the awkward stage of becoming an adult. You turned 18. You said goodbye to high school. You started your early life business. You also opened up select nutrition. A lot of crazy firsts, including this. Your first boyfriend. Your first case. First date. Corona style. The first time driving. The first time getting your permit. Your first time getting all organized and cleaning and cooking on a regular basis. A little... I hope you only says back soon. If you don't know who you only says, you only says, my nanny from when I was two. She is also like our housekeeper. Since I was two, so she would come Monday through Friday. She would cook clean and like take care of everything at the house. While we were in school, in her business, whatever it had to be. But I still was in school at this time. So I had to learn how to cook in 2020 and do all my stuff by myself. So you only says back. I said, and a lot of unexpected firsts. Your first time you had to forgive. The first time going through a difficult family challenge. The first time having to leave the team at home and at the park and at church. A whole pandemic. The first time you went through a breakup. First time you faced a lot of new challenges. The first time you truly have had to go through healing. And right now it seems like life is hard. It's frustrating.

Not just any king, but the king of kings and the Lord of Lords. Let him define you and let him sit on the throne of your heart. I love you. I'm so excited for what's to come. One last thing. The best is yet to come. Love you. I'm Joe 2020. Oh my gosh. Like I said, I am different than I was last year. I'm so thankful because I feel. I feel like God. Oh okay. Let me read a little bit. I'm very thankful for this last year. It's been probably the most difficult. I've had to go through. One day I'll be able to tell my like my story and share what God did specifically. But right now I just want to say thank you to God for taking me out of this. Let me pick and putting my feet on solid rock on the solid foundation because um a lot of things and people leave and change. But God is the same. I also wanted to myself. I wanted to see how far I've come. I wanted to see what God has done. How I thought last year and how I'm going into this new year. It's very exciting. I'm very excited for this next year and I'm so I'm crying mainly because I'm really thankful that I'm not that hurt girl anymore. That I am here. That God is faithful and that he led me to to forgive and to to trust and to walk in confidence and not insecurity to love people who hurt me. I'm so excited for this next year. 2022 is going to be great. I was commenting to someone. I think it was my mom. Not sure but I feel like this last year God had to allow my heart to heal. Like grow deep roots with him. So that when it is time to start building I do not thought because I am rooted. I rooted in him and who he says I am and what he's called me to do. And so everything I build from that source and that foundation is going to stand from because it's on solid ground and it doesn't change. Wow okay that was a little emotional moment. I was watching the my livestream that I posted on my instagram. I just can't believe I was like that. I'm so excited. I'm so happy. I'm so proud and I'm in a season in my life where it's just God. God has healed me and he's moving me forward. It's time to build. It's time to produce. It's time to work and be faithful and I'm really excited for that. I love doing that. I love serving God and serving His people. So many changes are going to come as well as on my YouTube channel. I want to post more faith stuff and share more about that because it is a big part of my life. And I encourage you. I'm going to do this again because I want to see where I'm at next year. I'm excited. I'm so excited. I'm probably going to do the same thing. We'll see. I'm going to write a letter to myself. I encourage you to do the same. In my Instagram video, I kind of mentioned how I was lucky. A prayer. A prayer to God. Where I want to be and who I want to be come. So just reaffirms the vision that God that God will has for my life. That that may send. I'm going to keep this because it's very near and dear to my heart. I remember writing this on the floor. I was so heartbroken. I was just done. I was done with life. But I still chose to write out that truth of maybe being a child of God, maybe chosen, maybe instead of part all these things that I like. Set over myself. I just want to encourage anyone who may be going through a hard, difficult challenge in your life. Whether it be losing someone, whether it be heartbreak or a breakup or whatever. A difficult time or season you're going through in your life. Just know that you are so loved. You have a hope that there is a hope. There is a future for you and that the best is yet to come. A moment in time does not define who you are. Just know that there's so much hope. So many great things are to come and that what you went through. What you went through will glorify God.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0FRRlQCmqE,Josy," Hi guys, it's me, Danny. I've been thinking about something for the past like a couple months honestly, and it's been kind of life changing for me, so I thought I would share it with you guys. So my friend was over last night, and she was telling me about how like in her life, she just wanted it to go differently, and she kind of wishes she was somewhere else in her life right now, and she feels like she's had so many bad days recently, like her life just kind of sucks right now, and she's very down like in general. And I told her this thing that I've been thinking of how you can either see your life as like a bad life, like I'm having a really hard time right now, or you can just see it as a bad day, and then tomorrow could be good or bad or whatever. And it's something I've been thinking for a while because I always used to do this thing where if I felt sad, I would like apply it to my entire week or month, and it was like I'm having a really hard time right now. Like I would always say that to Emma, and he would be like, Danny, like, yeah, you're having a bad day, but your life isn't bad. Like you were happy like a week ago, you're not necessarily having a hard time right now. And I was like, hmm, that's interesting. Like sometimes, yeah, if you're a freaking failing member dies or something, like yeah, that makes sense. Like you'd have a really hard time in life. But in terms of just regular life and normal issues that come and go mental health problems, like career stuff, whatever, things are constantly going up and down. Like even in the span of a day, you can have a horrible morning and a great evening, you know? And so the tendency to kind of label an entire life as bad or an entire time period as not good, I think is a little bit harmful to your mental health. And what I mean by that is that you can see things whatever way you want to see it. And this is kind of where my radical acceptance thing to my therapist talking comes in. He always talked about how like if someone hurts me, I can either view it as them trying to hurt me or I can view it as me just feeling hurt by something that somebody else did. And it kind of removes the responsibility from anybody and it just attributes the feelings to feelings. Does that make sense? So it's not like, oh, this person hurt me. This person is a jerk. This person should have done better. It's like, oh, I'm feeling a lot of hurt right now. I should probably like figure this out and talk to this person and fix our relationship or cut them out of my life or whatever. And there's not this like vindictive, angry view of the world. And the same goes for what I was talking about with my friend. Like when bad stuff in life happens, you can either view it as everything bad is happening to me. My life is so bad. Everything is so terrible. Or you can view it as, oh, I had a bad day today. I'm going to try again tomorrow. And even if you have 100 bad days, right? Even if your entire year has been horrible. You still don't have to view it as a bad life. And I know that that's hard. Like it's definitely a lot easier said than done. But if everybody could get to a point in life where they're just like, oh, yeah, I had a bad morning or I had a bad night. But tomorrow might be better. And if every night you went to sleep thinking, okay, whatever happened today is a relevant. Like it's over. It already happened. I'm going to try again tomorrow. I feel like we would be a lot happier like as human. I feel like there's this tendency to lean into your sadness a lot and to lean into your mental health issues because for so long, like mental health issues were just completely ignored. And like nobody wanted to talk about it. So nowadays in 2021, oh wait, it's 2022. Nowadays in 2022, everybody's like, we have to talk about this. My mental health is really bad. Everything is bad. I need to be sad. I need to express my feelings. I need to feel this right this second. Like my trauma is ruining my life. Like, you know, you guys see that stuff on social media all the time. So do I. I'm even, you know, responsible of doing that for sure. And people kind of started even hating on positivity. Like toxic positivity. And like, don't be so happy all the time. Like I'm sad and just let me be sad. So there's definitely some truth to that. Like movement. Like I'm definitely not saying that's wrong. But I think the goal should just be to have some kind of middle ground between that, right? And there's nothing wrong with kind of just putting your feelings away and saying, okay, I'm going to deal with that later. As long as you're still taking care of yourself. And that's again, kind of goes back to my thing of it's not a bad life. It's just a bad day because if you're just constantly living in your sadness and your issues all the time, yeah, it could be a bad life. And like you could definitely see it as that. Or you can just see it as I'm really struggling right now. And I'm going to deal with my feelings and whatever. But I still have a chance to make it better. And also, let's go beyond that. What even is the definition of a bad day? Like if you were sad that day, if you were angry that day, is it a bad day? Do you have to call it a bad day? Do you have to call it a bad morning? If you woke up in a bad mood, like I'm not saying everything has to be perfect all the time. But you could also just see it as a mood. You could see it as neutral. You could see it as you felt something. You know, somebody hurt you. You yelled, you screamed, you cried, whatever it was. Like you can see those things, but you don't have to label them as good or bad. I feel like the good emotions are like happiness and euphoria and joy and love and forgiveness or whatever that means. And then all the bad feelings are like anger, sadness, jealousy. Like it's like all that stuff is labeled as good or bad. And I understand why some things are labeled as bad. But you also don't have to do that. It doesn't have to feel good, but it doesn't have to be bad. It can just be I felt this way today. Today I had a shitty time. You know, I spent the whole day in bed and it didn't feel very good. Tomorrow I'm going to try to do better. And if the next day you still don't do better, you just keep going because I always tell Emma this like, what the hell else are you going to do? Are you going to stop? Are you going to give up? No, you're not going to give up. You're not going to die, right? You're just going to keep living. So your options are to keep living and to not try and to just say that you have a bad life and everything sucks and that's it because that's what I always used to do. Or you can say, okay, I'm going to keep trying tomorrow and I'm going to keep trying to get better. And I'm not going to get so down on myself if I fail. And if I miss the mark and maybe today I didn't do some crazy self improvement thing and oh, I spent the whole day in bed. I'm a horrible person. Like you don't have to feel so bad about yourself because there's not this expectation. And that all just goes back to my acceptance thing. Like you don't have expectations of what your life is supposed to be. Or who you should be, who other people should be, where you should be in your life. Like I'm going to look at everybody else who is 21 years old and has a savings account or a perfect relationship or whatever. And I'm going to feel bad about myself because I don't have a savings account and I don't have a perfect relationship, right? Like that's a tendency. That's what everybody does. That's what I do every single day. I look at other girls' bodies and I'm like, I wish I looked like that, you know? And it makes me feel bad about myself. But if I break it down, like I'm only feeling bad about myself because of the comparison. If the comparison wasn't there, if I didn't know that other people existed, I wouldn't feel bad about myself because I would just be. And that's it. So if you just stop expecting everything to be a certain way, you won't be let down as much. And I think you'll appreciate life more because it's not going to be like, oh, I was so sad today. It was a horrible day. It could be like, oh, I had a very transformative day actually. I cried the whole day and I actually feel a lot better tonight. There's always a way that you can spend things not necessarily to be positive, but just to not be so sad all the time. And when I started thinking like that and trying to complain less, I've just noticed a huge shift in my life in my mindset. So yeah, if you guys are feeling like shit all the time, maybe this will help you. Maybe it won't. I don't know. But I've just been thinking about it a lot and I hope that you guys understand what I'm saying. Before I go, I have a sweatshirt that I made and it's my merch. And it's almost sold out. There's literally 10 size smalls left. Like there's very few unisex size smalls left. It's sold down every other size. So I want to make a new hoodie. I might want to restock this one. I'm not sure, but these size smalls are just hanging on by a thread. So go to the link in my description and check out this hoodie. And if you're a unisex size small, which is kind of just like a min size small, it's like a bigger women size small, go to the description and check it out. Okay, I love you guys.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9OYuxmjYWE,Josy," Part of my junior year and part of my, in all of my senior year, I was attending high school on the Basin Japan. While I was there, I met this woman, this girl, and got to know her through her brother. She was a big girl and everything. She got a job in the NCO club where I was watching dishes. She was Boston tables. We flirted all the time and we were talking to her from Cut-Off. We really had a lot of chemistry. But I was just a shy, fat, sit face. I mean, no self-esteem at all. Get home. And I never did anything about it. And one night I was at the movie theater and I saw her in a distance of the part of the parking lot walking in to go see the same movie. She was by herself. And I sat, I was sitting, I got out of the theater and I sat, I saw what she was sitting because it was just like the big knee on the side. Come sat with me. And I didn't do it. I sat there, just too shy and too insecure. I was rooted in this chair. I was a little bit of a theater. And then I watched the movie. One home didn't think anymore about it. I was used to doing crap like that. My teenage years of terrible. And then I saw her at the end of the year. I asked her if she enjoyed the movie. She said it's sad. She came in and she was throwing trays around and slamming them. She was pretty angry. And finally she came back a little later and she calmed down. She said, you know, guys are supposed to make the first move. And that was the end of that. You know, I know. So on the old line, I'm 63 years old and I still think about her and I still think about that night.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFcOnXMG9co,Josy," I'm 30 years old and looking back in my 20s, in a way I completely wasted them. In this video, I'm just going to explain how I did that, what was going through my mind, my belief systems, and why it's actually a paradox and a good thing that I wasted my 20s. The reason for that being that it led me to where I am today. Let me explain. My entire 20s, I was driven basically by my ego and it's attempt to receive external validation from the world and other people. My ego was very fragile. It caused me to put on many different masks where many different costumes, metaphorical costumes. To impress other people, I wanted people to view me certain ways. I wanted them to view the way I thought I should be viewed. I put on these masks, hoping that they'd see me for who I wanted them to see me as. There's always something missing inside of me. I had a normal childhood. I had a great childhood, great family, a lot of friends, loving family and friends, good school, good opportunities. But there's always something missing. There's always something missing in here, so I sought it from the outside world. In my early 20s, I decided to go to school for something that I knew would make me a lot of money that would make my parents proud, that would make my friends think that I was successful. I went to school for that and I got a job afterwards for something directly related to what I went to school for in hopes that people would view me as successful, view me as somebody who made it. I did all that and I got the job and I worked the job and I made a lot of money all for other people and all for the way other people viewed me. The thing about that is that people get to decide whatever they want to think about me. They get to believe what they believe. Even though I'm trying to do this, trying to make them see me a specific way, they may never not see me that way. That's why it's very futile to seek external validation because at the end of the day, I'm not the one who gets to decide what other people think of me. I went and got this awesome job that at least I thought was awesome and I thought other people would think is awesome. In reality, I did not enjoy. I didn't get any fulfillment from it. I only got money from it and that money just fed into my consumerism and materialism which was also external validation seeking because once again, I wanted people to see me as somebody who is successful. I wanted to be respected. I was sort of the center of the universe in other people's worlds. I was putting myself. I wanted to be the center of attention in other people's worlds and once again, it doesn't work that way. I don't get to decide what the center of someone's universe is. But I spent my whole 20s doing that. I did everything based on external validation and I had a complete external locus of control. I went and I bought a fancy sports BMW $80,000 vehicle because I wanted people to see that and sort of have their jaws drop. He's got that car at that age. Man, he's made it. So I had the house, I had the car. I went and bought a bunch of expensive outfits. There were times where I was probably wearing between all the items of clothing that I spent money on. I was wearing close to a thousand bucks between all the layers of shirts and my pants and my fancy shoes and the fancy chain and rings and accessories and jacket. It was a lot of money I spent because that's what I thought people, because that way I could kind of control what people were thinking of me. Basically what I was doing was I was going to the circus dressing up as a clown and performing for people and I was making an identity, multiple identities throughout the course of my 20s. Based on what I wanted people to see me as, I was a clown at the circus. And the thing about clowns that are professional clowns, they do all that. They dress up and then they go to the circus. But then at the end of the day they realize that that's not who they are. They wipe the makeup off and then they go home and live their lives. I never did that. I was 100% clown all the time. I would play tricks on myself and say, this is who I am. I'm this rebel, this guy who marches to the beat of my own drum. I even got tattoos because I thought people would think I was cool. I had an image I had to give off. I had many expectations of people to see me a certain way. Anyassure, I did. Sometimes get some validation from people. People would ask me what my job people would compliment me on my vehicle or the way I looked. But at the end of the day it was nowhere near of what I expected of people, of the attention that I thought I should get. Poppies, come on. My whole sense of purpose and being was coming from the outside. But it was all on my terms. People had to see me the way I wanted to be seen. And nothing was coming from within here. This led to a lot of suffering, pain and depression. It was all self-inflicted. I self-medicated with substances, alcohol and other illicit substances. My entire 20s, in my early 20s, it wasn't that bad. But as I progressed through my 20s, it built the depression and the anxiety built. So I sort of treated all this pain with substances. And they worked for a time and then they sort of lost their effect. When I was about 20-70, anxiety that had been building in my body because of the way I was living my life, it had built in my body so greatly that it started mapping. I was manifesting in severe physical symptoms. One day I woke up, while I was walking down my stairs and I lost my balance and went into the wall. And for three months, I had no balance. I had to walk. Like I had to widen my stance and walk, just to walk in a straight line. Looking back on it now, it's actually, I look back and it was, I can kind of find, see the humor in it. At the time, it was complete darkness. The anxiety manifested in other forms to it. It manifested as, you know, my whole body was spasming. I would feel sensation of paralysis in my limbs. I would get blurry vision and I would get partial or complete and or complete blindness in one, or both of my eyes. This usually happened at night. It was very scary time. The doctors thought I had MS and there was a lot of testing that was done with no evidence. And one doctor thought that I should go on some volume for the spasms I was having. And it fixed everything. The volume is an anti-anxiety medication and it fixed everything. All my symptoms were gone. Like within two days of on-valume, everything was gone. So the doctor, that doctor, knew right away that I was suffering psychosomatic anxiety disorder and that's what it was. So I didn't start as self-medicating with. I then started medicating in my late 20s heavily with alcohol and other substances that inevitably led to a mental breakdown when I was 29. And I ended up in a detox facility and rehab facility for seven weeks. And that was the point where I sort of had a bit of a shift and then I sought therapy. And I went, I did some heavy therapy for two years. And that is where I learned to sort of disconnect from everything. So my entire 20s I was living through a great deal of pain and suffering and it was a good thing. So I suffered a great deal through my 20s and it was all worth it. Because it led to my breakdown, which inevitably led to a mindset shift, complete belief system reset. I thought I had to believe certain things to be who I was. I was not living as my own person. So this breakdown led me to this and I was able to sort of rebuild and uncover who I truly was. I was able to disconnect from everything that I thought I needed to be. And I was able to disconnect from the fact that I can't control what other people think and what they think of me. That's not any of my business what people think of me. I can only be who I am and people are going to think whatever they want to me whether it's good or bad. That's out of my control. So yeah, in a way I wasted my 20s but in a way it wasn't a waste at all. It wasn't a waste at all. It's a great paradox of life. Because if I never went through what I went through I never would have had the breakdown which led me to where I am today. And where I am today is much better than where I was in my 20s. And a lot of people they go through life struggling, never really understanding why. And I should speak for myself because everybody's life is different. But if I never would have had that breakdown I could have went through my entire life lost. So I'm thankful that I went through the pain and the suffering. And I'm thankful for where that has led me today. So tell me what you think does any of this relate to your experience? The whole purpose of this video is to if this can relate to you or anybody. I wanted to share this experience because maybe there's somebody out there that can kind of relate to what I'm saying.",30 Years Old: I Wasted My 20s,10.08.2021,David Masson,Man,30s,9:38,8,"0,9915"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73emk2THPPg,Josy," Nobody cares about you. I remember growing up just feeling different. Always feel like I'm left out of things. Growing up, I used to always care about people and put others first. When I used to go out and play with my friends at the park or when there's snack time in class, I used to always go to the corner store and buy a lot of snacks and drinks. And when I would get back to the park, I would share with everybody. And everybody would be happy. And I would make sure I give everybody a bag of chips. And if they didn't want something to eat, I would give them a drink. And you know when we're all kids, we just eat chips and drink hugs. Baguette chips used to be a quarter and a small hug drink would be a quarter. Those were the good times. And I remember during class, when I would bring a snack and when some of my classmates didn't have nothing to eat and they asked me if they could get some, I would give them some of my snack, whether it's chips, cookies or whatever I had. But I remember there were a few days where I didn't have any money. I couldn't buy my own chips and drinks. And when they had snacks and we were all playing at the park when they had something to drink, I would ask them, can I get some chips? And they would say no. And that really got to me because all these, all this time I got called back. I would share with everybody. Put them when I'm down, when I don't have any money, when I have nothing to eat. Nobody cared about me. I just sat by myself and I just felt stupid. I just felt like I didn't really have any true friends. I didn't really have anybody that cared about me. And the same thing would happen in class if I forget to bring a snack where I didn't have money and I had nothing to eat. And I asked the same people that I share with, like, hey, can I get a piece? And they would be like, no. That's when I realized nobody cares about you in this world. Everybody just wants to be around you. Everybody just wants to be around you when you have money, when you can feed them, when you can help them. But the moment you're down, and you don't have any money or you don't have anything, nobody sees you anymore. Nobody cares about you anymore. Nobody cares. And life just sucks. I remember when I was younger, just growing up being different and just feeling like I was ugly and I used to think, like, if I could just be average, if I could just fit in with everybody else and just get along. How life would be so much better. And I remember one time I was at the playground with my friends. And there was this one girl that came up to me and she was like, I've never met somebody as ugly as you. Like, you're so ugly. Like, you're really ugly. I remember telling her, I remember saying like, I know I'm ugly. And I wish I was better looking. But I'm not. Nobody cares about you. And life itself is just a constant struggle. I feel like I can never get a peace of mind. There's always the next challenge. Once I saw one thing, another problem comes. It is never ending. It's like I used to struggle with relationships, but then when I get a girlfriend, I guess I just dated the wrong ones a few times. And I was just a nice guy. I was too nice and I always cared about their feelings and always made sure that they're happy. But perhaps I was just treating the wrong person right. And all they ever did was cheat on me and flirt with other guys and just left me for somebody else. Even relationships, it's a struggle to find someone that you're compatible with. Someone that actually has your back. Somebody that actually loves you and cares about you and isn't selfish. Even relationships, you gotta go through so many toxic relationships and so many people who don't deserve you. It's hard to just find some people who are loyal and trustworthy and you know will be there for you no matter what. It's so hard to find people like that. And it's not just finding a girlfriend as loyal, it's finding friends that are loyal. Finding genuine people that actually care about you. It's a constant struggle. And you don't have as much friends and then the little bit of friends that you have in high school, once you graduate, you no longer really communicate with them. We kinda all just go down our different paths and we kinda just separate. And life after school is just loneliness and you really only have a few friends if that. And then all it really is, it's just working nine to five. And most people are just miserable and lost and don't really know what they wanna do with their life or just, and you just work your whole life away until you're old and if the economy is any good, you might be able to retire. And then from there, you have a few years left and then you just die. That's all life really is. You're born, you go to school, you work, you get old, you retire and then you just die. Sometimes I really wonder what the purpose of life is. It's a lot of suffering, a lot of, it's just a lot of emotional trauma and suffering and betrayal and struggles. And the only advice that we really get is, oh, make sure you go to college, make sure you go to college. Not everybody's meant to go to college. Not everybody really, it's not really the best path for some people because some people just ends up getting their degree and can't even get a job in that field. It's just a waste of money. And you know what the worst feeling is when you have a degree and you feel like that degree is worthless. And you feel worthless. That's the worst feeling. When you feel like a degree on your resume means nothing. When you can't even land a job interview, when it can't even get past, they're automated system that just rejects you. You don't even get a human to look at that resume with a degree on there. You feel worthless. And even when you have a degree, you don't have any experience. If you haven't, it's like a degree means nothing when you have no experience, when you have no connections. When entry level jobs require five years of experience, it's just frustrating. It's like, what was the point of me going to school then? What was the point of me getting this degree? Like, can we have some real entry level jobs? Can we get some real entry level jobs that require no experience? Can we see some of that? And then when jobs want five professional references, like I could be hardworking, I could, I'm a quick learner, but I don't have the five references that you want. Five professional references that you want. I don't have that. I don't have that much work experience. And then being an introvert, it's just hard to connect with people to get these professional references. But I know if I put my mind to something and I work hard, I could do it. I could do the job. And perhaps on paper, I don't look like the most qualified person. But then I see a bunch of people that get hired because everything looks good on their resume. They look qualified on their resume, but they're not really the best fit for that company and they don't do the best job, but they get hired. I don't know, it's just life is too hard, man. There's always the next challenge and the next challenge, you fix this another problem. I'm tired, I'm tired. I'm tired of figuring shit out. I'm tired of trying to solve these problems. And it's true, nobody in this world can help you. Nobody in this world cares about you and nobody in this world can help you. The only person that can help you is yourself. And that's just a lonely world, such a lonely world to live in. Like sometimes I feel like if poor people brand the government, life will probably be so much better. Because the rich people, they don't understand the struggles of everyday poor people. When they don't know something, they just hire people to solve their problems. They have connections. They have the money to just fix things. You understand how it feels to be poor and when you don't know something, you just don't have the money to hire people to figure things out for you. You can't hire people to solve your problems. Now, only poor people genuinely knows how it feels to be down here. And I feel like the older we get, we just have less friends and a way society is going. Nowadays, everybody is so isolated. Everybody's just on their devices. Everybody wants human connection, but nobody wants to reach out with nobody wants to actually connect. I just want a few solid friends. I just had your back when you're down and you know you'll have their back when they're down. That's just what I want. And it's even worse when you don't have supportive parents. Your parents are the ones that care about you yet they're the first ones to put you down. They're the first ones to tell you that you're useless, that you're nothing, that you're just trash and never support you in anything you do. Everything, everything you do is wrong. If you don't do what they want you to do, you're wrong. It's like, can I just do what I like? Do you even know what I like to do with my life? Do you even know what makes me happy? And perhaps I have certain passions that I want to pursue. Can I just do that? What I'll be compared to everybody else, like, oh, look at your cousin. Look at this person, look at that person. They're so successful. Can I not be compared with anybody else because I'm me? I'm not them. And there's always about them being better than you as certain things. What about me being good at things? What about the things that I'm good at? Is that not important? Life definitely does suck. And there's a lot of struggles. What all we can really do is live day by day, take one day at a time, one step at a time, and I don't know, life just sucks, man. And just societal pressure. And sometimes the pressure can really get to you and you just feel worthless. And you just feel like you're not built for this world. Like, there's days where I feel like I'm just not built for this world. Like, this world is too much. I'm just not meant to be in it. I don't know, it's tough. I just constantly tell myself, the best thing that I could do is just keep holding on and just keep pushing. I just gotta take it one day at a time, and focus on one step at a time. I just gotta keep going. I just gotta be myself. And I just gotta be my best self and keep pushing. I think we all have them days where we feel like we wanna give up. I think the most scariest thing if you really think about it is not everybody wins. And life you'll have winners and you'll have losers. Not everybody makes it. And that's just biology. It's natural selection. I hope we all make it. But the only thing we can do is just try our best and keep pushing forward. That's all we can offer. That's all we can do. At the end of the day, like, sucks is constant. Constant battles and struggles and tired. I really feel like I'm tired of this world. I have to keep going. We all have to keep going. And we all have to try our best and try to make it. And try not to let, and try not to let the pressure get to us.",Life Rant,14.11.2023,KevSoLitty,Man,20s,13:32,10,"0,9965"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keDTnc2JZkc,Josy," What's the point of life? Tworkin 9-5 in Diabro? I just give that title a like... Ever since I was a kid, all I've done was make videos, bro. That's literally all I've done, bro. That's the thing I've been passionate about. Since I was a kid, I've been doing this. The thing you call YouTube Pressing Playmaking videos. Since I was a kid, bro. And the fact I haven't made yet sucks is I'm not gonna shoot the content. I'm not gonna say I don't feel bad or sad. Oh, it sucks I've been doing YouTube for years. And I have barely just made it. It's fake. But what I've made is so fake. Oh, for sure, man. And it's like I've been wanting this all my life and I can't give it up, man. I can't give it up. So what's the point back to what I was saying? What's the point of life if you can't have your dreams. If you can't succeed, if you can't do what you're all you want to do what you're all you want to do. But you're forced to do what you don't want to do. When life should be about doing what you love and how come I can't make it do it? When I love how come life has to suck God like what is your plan for my life? Am I supposed to just sit and not hear to just suffer? All we all hear to just suffer and die. Because a lot of people make it but a lot of people don't. That's the reality. There's a lot of people who aren't making it. A lot of people say, falling your dreams, takes your dreams and aren't making it. There's a lot of people in a lot of small cities that want to be YouTubers. There's millions of people that want to be YouTubers. Why can't everyone be YouTubers? Why can't everyone be big? Why does majority of society have to settle for less? Why? Why does life like that? And I think I've just come to think there's a life that's unfair. It doesn't always anything. We're not owed anything. It's like we're not owed success. We're not owed a good life. I guess life just people have to suffer. There's no good without evil. There's no yin without yin. Why? What's the point of it all? To just suffering. To die. And nothing after. We're really good. So here's suffering. Die. And nothing after. Is that really? That's our life. That's what we're here for. Work your 9-5. Be a loser. Buy. This is what I do this man. Because I have no purpose outside of this. I literally have nothing. I'll do it in this. Except the regular 9-5. We can live off that. What is the point of it all? Especially if you're nobody. Especially if you're broke. Especially if nothing's going on in your life. What's the point? You feel me?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVvKJgKD06k,Josy, What is good my journey is what is good so today is Jacobs talks this is a new series that I'm gonna bring to you guys I got this new mic hope you guys can hear me really really clearly but a struggle I have y'all is me finding love me feeling like I'm understood by my partner or me accepting I struggle with this some daily basis and sometimes I feel alone but I'm gonna tell you guys the truth I struggle with love you know another struggle I have has to be money I've never really had that big massive breakthrough in my life and I'm trying to find ways to find that breakthrough or have passive income where money is rolling in all the time you know but another struggle I have has to be me knowing the truth me knowing the truth I know this sounds crazy but we live in a world where the truth is bad and lies is good so probably example we just had this massive black lives matter of this writing thing going on and I knew that this person was gonna die before everybody else knew that's how wise I am I'm connected so when things happen on earth and we kind of react we almost hurt that we almost hurt the people that know the truth because now we're trying to come in and helping tell everybody the truth and they're like no that's bullshit you don't know what you're talking about so I struggle with that I struggle with that you know for my thing is I love all races I love black people I love white people I love Hispanics I love white people I love all and I know that when we die this game we are in is an illusion it's not real but you have some people that feel as a dough feel as though it's real so I struggle with with me actually having love for every race because if you're in a room with a person that's wounded that doesn't like another race they're gonna judge you and that's something I'll struggle with I love white people I love them I love them I love Hispanic people I love them I have a white play mother I have a Hispanic friends she's saying Texas I have a black friend her name is Kay I got so many white friends you know I'm saying so many black I got them all and I struggle with this because you have some people where they're so tied to the history in the past and they can't let it go and I understand that but I love all races and I get judged for it I know I do I know a lot of people got mad when I didn't post about the black lives matter I know but once you have this higher mind you know that we all have to come together and not be separated you know but sometimes when I gain all this wisdom I have trouble because you almost go through this whole journey of expressing and learning and now you're placing a room with people that's not learning or that's not really experiencing this wonderful experience you're feeling so now you feel like the outcast because people not talking about the deep shit you're talking about and that's just me where I know all this deep information I know about past lives recard nation that we're not the skin that the soul is immortal and you can't go in a party to talk about this deep stuff you just can't because they go and judge you and that's really what I have to go through is I know too much and especially when I go home my family don't talk about all this ancient wisdom they just don't they either turn up a drink and I accept them I love them but it hurts because it's like I'm holding all the pain and baggage of my family and they just don't know they don't know but it's something that's real so I hope y'all felt me in this little kind of like an interview documentary but just me opening up about what the fuck I feel in man this journey drains me to it drains the fuck out of me because I see so much shit and I know so much and when you know the truth in the world that praises lies you almost feel like I damn alien like shit that happened in this world and I just wrote it I'm like I get it I know why it's here but you got some people that think it's so real and I feel they pain I feel them it's like damn I know you can't escape I know you can't you know another thing to his music like hold on I don't know if y'all heard that music but music man I never really understood music especially when I became awakened so how music really works you know you played a radio and you hear all this crazy shit fuck the bitchy talky she's still my dick yeah I got the block of my waist you know what I'm saying it's just all just pain and anger and frustration I thought music was supposed to be love and another thing too I be in the car with my brother and my family and they playing all this crazy music and I'm just sitting there taking taking a pun all that vibration because music is vibration but people don't know this but this is something I struggle with is where people would judge me because I don't like rap music well I don't like all that extra shit I like something where I can vibe to relax to cleanse my mind to you know I'm saying so this was Jacob's talks thank you best friend for the name we was in the bed I mean it was not in the bed but it was on FaceTime I was in the bed and I was like I need a name for these podcast I need a name for these little shows just like Jacob's talks and I was like I like that I'm gonna give you a shout out when I do this but uh thank you best friend um hope you guys heard me with this new mic if it's signed to heart but let me know in the comments but I love you guys stay real don't hide your emotions don't hide your feelings always let them out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6SnQQjBBGY,Josy," What is up my lovely people today we're having a serious chat This one's kind of heavy man. This one's real heavy But first let me talk about the fact that This video is a replacement for the vlog that I was gonna do for this week Well, it's not our placement. I'm gonna be vlogging tomorrow on Friday, which is my last day of school But unfortunately was not in the mood to vlog today was not in the mood that not in the mood to vlog on Wednesday Because Tuesday was not a good day and also yesterday was probably one of the hardest days I've ever had You know just gonna throw that out there So you might be wondering what happened Tuesday because I post a vlog on Tuesday You guys are like oh, Jay will you man look like having fun you yeah, that a lot of fun but Third hour I was chilling and I was just not happy not at all man and I Just simply could not go to fourth hour and you guys know I've been skipping a little bit I've been skipping fourth hour a little bit because you know the class is fairly easy I just took a final today. It's pretty easy didn't really need to be in class to know all this stuff Still I don't really condone skipping school. I shouldn't be skipping school The third hour I was like you know what I'm so done and then I skipped fourth hour I just went in my car I cried a little bit. I went to McDonald's and had a full large coke within the span of like 20 minutes And if you don't know I love soda. I love soda to death But that was not good bro any who so I basically just stayed in my car for maybe three hours And then I finally went home around two thirty or three and for reference I had Got in out of school because I skipped at 11.45. So 11.45 to about two thirty. I'm doing absolutely nothing but crying, you know and I just wasn't having it that day, you know I've had a lot of bad days recently a lot of days where I just couldn't even Muster up the ability to go to school or work, you know Tuesday. I had to call out work I was supposed to get trained on kitchen Tuesday, but I couldn't I told them I had a family emergency I lied the emergency is me. I'm the crisis. I'm the family emergency So I got home and a few hours later my mom is like hey James Why am I getting a call from the school? Because you know the school they call her whenever you miss a day and I just told her straight up. I was like I skipped I was sad and I cried in my car My mom knows I have some problems. She knows I've been down recently You know if she's the one who I you know I went to her for the therapist. I've been seeing my therapist regularly but My mom had a big talk with me and at one point in the talk she was like are you having suicidal thoughts and I just nodded man I just I just like And it broke her heart And it was really sad to see my mom, you know Uh just to see my mom like that You know And I have these thoughts about running away all the time I always think like if I can't live happy I can just kind of drive cross country do whatever I want And then after that I'll die happy, you know But Seeing my mom like that and obviously I wasn't gonna do it anyway. I wasn't gonna run away But seeing my mom like that was just so heartbreaking And I bet her seeing me like this is so heartbreaking And it sucks It's it really sucks It really sucks man So she knows I have suicidal thoughts her first I was having this conversation with her and she was like do I need to call your dad? I'm gonna call your dad and I was like I was balling my eyes out and like please do not call my dad like Because I wanted my dad to know but I didn't want him to be on the call right then and there I just didn't I couldn't handle it Um but after the talk, you know my mom she's just concerned about me. She's just worried about me She was like do we need to take you to the hospital? I was like you're not taking me to the hospital I'm not going to a mental hospital Like straight simple as that My parents sent me to a mental hospital. I will run away for real And I will move out because I swear to god that is not something I want to do what so ever So My mom was like should we get you a psychiatrist and maybe they can prescribe you something and I was like You know what if nothing else has worked by this point I've been feeling this way for a year and a half And granted it's been worse in the past month or two But I've had like a general depression for a little over a year and a half I'd say And I told my mom how long it's been going on And she you know She was just worried she was sad um So I might be seeing a psychiatrist and I might try to diagnose me with something or prescribe me some drugs or whatever I don't know dude. I think I'm open to anything. I think I'm open to anything If a psychiatrist works a psychiatrist works, you know um Not really the first option I'd go to but It has to be one of the options, you know So my mom told my dad about this whole situation yesterday. I was out with Esther And so now my both my parents know that I've been having dark thoughts like that um It's really tough man. I never wanted them to know I mean, I'm not comfortable sharing things with my parents But I guess um I have to to an extent And they ask me questions like is it because of your relationship? Is it because of school and this and that and I either kind of avoid the truth or I just won't tell them Because I don't want them to know the specifics. That's for me my therapist Another news my dad wants to drug test me Because I guess if someone has a great life and is still sad then It might be a drug thing I guess that's his way of thinking. I mean, I called him yesterday and he was like why are you depressed like you have a great life And I was like yeah, you're right man. I do have a great life But sometimes it doesn't seem that way to me You know, it's a mental thing it sucks. It's it's the whole thing sucks That's how that's how it is man but um we keep pushing through And I don't know if they're gonna go through with a drug test I called him on the phone yesterday. He didn't mention drugs, but he was like is it this it was that and I was like Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's kind of like school stressing me out and I was like it's not a drug thing though Cuz can't guys look I smoke weed If you knew the channel and you don't know that I smoke weed. I do it every night It helps me fall asleep. I've never been a good sleeper and straight up. I just enjoy it I just enjoy the feeling it makes me feel happy at the end of the night And that's why I do it and The but it's not the reason for my depression because it's been going on so much longer I started like regularly smoking weed about almost a year ago now and I've been experiencing depression for a year and a half So it's not a drug thing But if I do get drug tested, I'm going to turn up positive for marijuana and That's gonna suck But I'm kind of at a point where it's like if they find out they find out You know, I got two more what is it yet three more months until I move out like I don't know. What are you gonna do ground me? I'm about to turn 18. I'm about to move out You can ground me you can take my phone. I don't know I'd rather really not take my phone because I make videos on it, but um We'll just see what happens And if it turns out that I do get drug tested I'm just gonna come clean to my parents. I'm gonna tell them that I smoke weed at night because it helps me Helps me sleep and you know all the other reasons I just mentioned I think I'll be open about it, but not unless they like Find out, you know, I'm not just gonna go up to my parents and get as smoke weed But um that's currently what's going on So both of my parents know that I'm suicidal now and They might find out that I smoke weed if they drug test me. Well, if they drug test me they will surely find out But let's hope that doesn't happen Anyways, I have one more day of school. I have to one more day of high school, baby so um Yeah, I got about 4 and a half hours of actual school left and until I can finally be done with high school I have one week until graduation man one week a week from today Absolutely bonkers absolutely bonkers and I'm trying to get in contact with um a friend of mine So I recently found out a friend of mine is into creative writing and he's into film just like I am So I think it would be really cool if I collabed with him maybe made some short films that we can post on here Um right after I'm done recording this I'm gonna contact him and see if he'd be down. So I appreciate you guys for listening. I really do Because I know some of you are either experiencing What I experience or something similar to it or a lot of you guys are a bit older than me and you're looking like this reminds you of your teenage years and Either way, I appreciate you listening either way I love each and every one of you and We just hit a thousand subscribers baby go to go for 10,000.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqwEt_Q0mmY,Josy," You know, I don't really love anyone in this world. I'm like really alone, like I'm really fucking lonely. I just want to come out here and I want to talk, say something, do something before I feel like I'm going to lose my fucking mind. I guess I'm trying to get away from all this shit, but you can't. It's impossible. You have to be around people. You have people fucking suck. People don't care about you. If you're a little weird or you're a little awkward, people fucking hate you. They don't want to be around you. And they don't care about any of your issues or how you feel whatsoever. That's the truth. I'm just starting like feeling this way, you know? Like I'm stuck, I'm trapped, I'm bored. There's nothing to do. Everything about life has to do with other people. And I don't want to be around other people anymore because all it is is disappointment every time. It's like they want you to be a certain way, but I can't be that way. I feel like I'm not supposed to be a part of this society. I don't fit in it. It's like really fucking irritating, man. I want to just drive away. Like I'm here in the back of the park and I just want to be by myself. It is like the most peaceful for me. So just be on my own. Just away from people. You know, I try so hard to like, to try and be normal, to be kind to others, to try and just fit in and create like relationships. But it's like impossible. I don't know. People just, if they don't like you, they don't like you. And it is what it is, you know? That's life. Life is bullshit. If you were born a certain way, like there's nothing you can do about it. And like that will always be a negative on you. It's easier for other people and it will be harder for you. I feel like most of life is decided from the moment you're born, depending on what location you're in, what kind of people are around you and neighborhood you grow up in, what kind of family you have. All of that is decided from the moment you're born and will impact everything else in your life. So if you had a fucked up family life, it's too late. Like that already has a big effect on you and you're going to use the rest of your life to try and fucking counteract all that bullshit that happened to you. Like it's really all about look in that way. But life is bullshit. That's what it is. Life is bullshit. And no matter how hard I cry or fucking complain about it, it's not going to change. This is just reality. I can dream about it. I can daydream all day about something better, but like this is reality. So I have to make what I can of it. Right? Because we're all going to fucking die someday anyways. So I just have to make what good I can of it, like whatever I can get out of this life. And whether it's making stupid videos and I know no one's going to watch this, no one's going to give a fuck or care about this. I'm still just going to put this up and hope someone can relate. I feel like no one gives a shit or cares about the problems I have or can relate to them. I want to try and do something where I put it online and I hope that people can listen and at least relate a little bit. That someone has the same issues. You know, I don't really love anyone in this world. I'm like really alone. Like I'm really fucking lonely. Like to a devastating extent. Like I'm such a loner. Like it's just my whole life. It's all I'm used to is being by myself. And I want to connect to someone. To me, like the thought of being close to someone almost seems like a far away dream. Like it doesn't even seem like something that's real. Yeah, it's so normal for other people. Yet for me to be close to someone, it just seems like something so far off that I could never do. You know, I don't know how I'm supposed to fix that. I was born a little weird, I guess. I don't know, I'm fucking, I've asked Pergerus maybe, I don't know, but I don't really know how to connect with anyone in a real way. She fucking bites at me, you know. I didn't do anything to the surf to be like this, but I'm just like that, I guess. And I'm going to make this video and no one's going to care either. But I just have to like keep trying, I guess. I hope at some point it gets better, but I don't know if it ever does. Or you just learn to live with it, you know. I guess it's a combination of things. Like I'm tired of being alone, but I'm also just tired of like life in the world itself. I'm just in my room and I keep thinking all the time and I just, I wish that there was more to this life. I wish it was better, but like that's reality and I hate reality right now. All I find myself doing is wishing that things were different, that things were better. But like this is just the cold reality right now and I don't like it at all. And it's been like this for years and I don't see it changing and I try and change it and it doesn't. I try and take matters into my hands. It's my own responsibility and I want to do things better. I've started to be more productive for like nothing changes. I've put myself out there to try and talk to people, but it doesn't work. Like I'm just meant to be like this. But I hope I share this video and someone relates to it. Someone can talk to me about this shit and tell me like yeah I did. I feel you man, like I've experienced this too. I don't know, I feel like no one's gonna fucking care. This isn't gonna reach anyone realistically. I say that as I hope that it does realistically probably won't. Your dreams are one thing, reality's another thing. And that sucks to realize that it really sucks. You know like when you watch a TV show, play a video game or something like that, it's like a great adventure. You know there's a plot to it. There's a character goes through a problem, they change, their problem is fixed. And that's not real life. Real life, there's a problem. You try your best to fix it and you don't know if the problem's gonna solve it. It probably won't. You know, you probably just get the bad ending. Your whole life is just a bad ending. And there's not much you can do about it. It feels like I wish I could have lived a normal life. I wish I could have lived a normal life I think. I don't know. I've just always, everything's always been so weird. Life feels so strange. I wish I could have just been normal, lived a normal fucking life. But like from the time I was a small child, I'd be here for real issues. I had family issues, everything was just strange. I've never fit in. I was just born to live a weird fucking life like this. It's tiring man. It's really tiring. And most people don't get it. But I'll finish off with this message is that life is absolute bullshit. But you should have to accept that and try and do whatever good you can do before you die. Because we're all gonna die someday anyways. We're all gonna fucking die. Don't worry, it's gonna come. If you wanna die, don't kill yourself. Just wait. Because you're gonna fucking die. Just try and get what good you can out of it. Especially while you're young. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna try and share this. So that anyone else that's struggling, I hope I really fucking hope that I can try and reach you. And tell you that like, hey man, we just gotta try. You know, we gotta keep trying and hope things get better. Maybe someday it'll give. And that's what I wanna do. I think I'm gonna make a lot of videos and stuff talking about things like this. Just try and make someone's day better as struggles with the same stuff. I have so much more I wanna say. But that's all I'll say for now, for another camera. But anyways, that's all.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmuoMQFcGww,Josy," I think I'm on my last thread. I'm like barely holding up. I feel like I'm losing my sanity and my sense of direction and goals and everything. I've been holding on for so long after graduating and suffering from the usual Gen Z bullshit right now being stuck at home and crazy and mentally ill and making parents that... I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. It's been like over two years. And then I think I'm just reaching my breaking point now. Today, I actually fucking sucked. It's just... I just... The world just fucking sucks. You know what I'm feeling? Like everything seems dim around you. Lights don't feel right. And you're just like tired because you don't get enough sleep or you just sleep too much. For me, I don't get enough sleep. I just sleep deprivation every single day. Even though I don't really have the pressure of like, you know, waking up early. But I go to sleep late and I try to... And then I try to make myself wake up early. Sorry, that was my car. Shut up car. But I just like go through the cycle every single day. And like I hate myself with scrolling. Like on TikTok or YouTube or whatever and bed until 3 a.m. And then I ask this at the same time. I want to force myself to wake up earlier. So I feel more productive. But then by the time it comes at 10 a.m. Like I wake up to my alarm. I press like snooze like 30 times. Like every 15 minutes the alarm goes off again, right? And then I just keep doing that until like... noon. So I wasted two hours and I still wasn't asleep. And I still wake up sleep deprived. And just like frustrating myself. What I've been doing for like the past few months. I don't know why. I mean, I know why. That's like a common signs depression. Like you only feel safe at night. That's how you like scrolling your active at night. It's like almost like manic mode. And then obviously you go on the cycle, right? When you do want to improve yourself. But you just can't... Because your body also doesn't... Even if you get up so your body still doesn't want to wake up really. You just want to avoid... Like having contact with your family. That's the case for me. But... I don't know if it's better or worse that I'm aware of this. Because either way I feel like shit. I feel like I'm too aware and makes me depressed. Like I know of... Just like the common patterns around me. The people around me like why they're acting like this. And it just makes me sad and like the life in shit. So like... Your life sucks. Like I just had a panic attack yesterday. And... That feeling of doom that I'm gonna die for sure. Holy shit dude. I haven't felt that feeling since like... I don't know I was a kid. To like my teenage years. I've been called. I felt that feeling way too many times. That is like a non-normal. To feel like you... At the end of the world. Like you're gonna die. You know that feeling. Especially over like dumbest things. Like oh I dropped this thing on the ground as dirty. Because my mom's a germa folks. She's gonna get mad at me. And she's gonna like punish me. You know? And just...or stuff like... I'm like, I'm gonna die. I'm like a retrospect right now. It doesn't fucking... For me. It doesn't fucking matter what college you want to. Yeah sure. I want to like a top 50 globally ranked school in Asia. Or just ranked worldwide. Like... So what? I can't find a job. It's like I went through all that shit for nothing. Go on with tangent again. But... I'm just recording right now for the sake of my sanity as well. This feels like my kind of like diary journal. Whatever you want to call it. I just can't write. My ADHD is like too shit from what I realized. So I'm gonna get diagnosed. But I've way too many like common patterns of it. But... I also noticed my speech compared to my healthiest years. When I was away from my parents. When I was studying for college. I've been studying like way more. Basically my confidence has just gone down. And I'm just like in my own fucking world. It's hard for me to interpret things correctly. Right now the only hope that I have is that... I know... If I'm at healthiest, I know there's a sense of hope. Because I was at the healthiest. And I know what's in store for me. But... If I were to say my current state right now, I'm no fucking hope. I probably just die. But I'm not choosing to kill myself. Because... I know... Of... That hope. That my healthiest version of me will tell them. Me in my current state.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt8YXETwG64,Josy," I don't know about you, but sometimes I just don't want to live because life is so stressful. It causes me a lot of mental pain, physical suffering, emotional suffering, etc. And the way life is being operated, you know, is a universal thing. Go to work, make money, pay your bills, achieve goals, be a slave, a modern day slave, to the job you work for. And to me, that's as bullshit because we'll some point of all that if it means in the end, we're all gonna die. We're gonna story ends one day for each and every single one of us. So what's the whole reasoning behind working hard, suffering, once again mentally and physically, emotionally? Rinse and repeat, right? Most people do this on a daily basis, if not, you know, five days a week, which pretty much is an everyday grind because on a weekend, when you have time off, right, you're probably spending one day having fun. And the next day you're prepping for work because it's right around the corner. And a few hours, you'll be back on the daily hustle again. So I like to question myself because I'm honest. Why the fuck do I want to live if I have to live like this? And I know it's just not me because once again, so we're a white thing, it exists all around the world. Across the globe, just about anywhere where life exists, right? But I question myself, why? What I want to live like this is not even a choice, either, which is this sad part because everybody's doing it. But just because everybody's doing it, it was a mean. It's the ideal way of living. It's the ideal way to go about life. I think it's fucking bullshit, I think it doesn't make any sense that I'm going to do all of this just to die in the end. Where's the appeal? How is that desirable? How am I living the American dream? You know, because I am from America. But the point is that's most people's dream. They just have a good job, get paid well to buy material, expense on material goods, right? Because a lot of people are materialistic. It's fine, you know, I'm not judging. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but we pretty much just work for money just so we can buy shit. And also spend it on meaningless stuff. And obviously pay bills, which is an necessity. There's no way around that. But I don't see how this is really living. Like I got through all this trouble. I got a work, work, work, work, work. Stress the fuck out. Until retirement day. It didn't have a few years left. Or several or a ton, right? Did you get my point? After you retire, you more likely are at age where you just want to rest because at that age of retirement, you know, you're pretty much beat up. And I don't agree with how we have to wait until retirement. I know we can start living because obviously we're still working full time. You don't have the time to do anything. So are we really living? If we're going to live a life that's unfulfilled because all we're doing is working, getting by, surviving, saving up, right? When in the end is like, you spent your whole fucking life doing that. And then you died. So as mentioned earlier, where is the appeal? How is that any form of being desirable? I'm going to die at the end of the day. I was the point of even doing anything. Yeah, it's pretty much what I'm trying to get at. What is the whole purpose of doing anything? When I'm going to just die, that I can't take nothing with me. I will no longer exist. I will no longer be aware of my thoughts. I will no longer care because I can't care anymore because I can't feel I can't think, can't do anything. So I don't, I don't get it. But to think about it, and to recap, this is what I'm understanding how life works. Here born, you become a workslave, you serve to whatever job you work for, then you die. Where is stuff fun in that? People say, oh, work hard. Prepare for the future. What fucking future? You fucking die at the end of the day. Excuse me, you fucking die in the end. So where's the, where's the reward, right? Because you're working hard for everything that you accomplish in life. So what good does it do for anybody? Really? Your work, you serve, you die. That's it. What's the point? What's the fucking point? It means absolutely nothing. Not the end of the day. What a story ends. I don't know. This is how I feel. Anyways, I'll make more videos that I have under stuff to talk about, which I'm pretty sure there are plenty of stuff to talk about.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v44p9ueyqRU,Josy," It's going on to Rome's raw real car rant. And so I came across a post on social and it was the sky. It goes around interviews, old people for lack of better term, the the olds. And basically like they go through like the number one piece of advice is always life is more than money. And as a young person, you're like man, that old person's full of poop, right? And all all this stuff about hustle culture, grind culture, you know, burdening the candle at both ends. It's really sexy and invoked right now. And also not to get into it, but with the economy the way it is. I feel like most people need like three jobs to get by anyways. But at the end of the day, they're right. And you know, I've been on this rock for 38 years and I've definitely been a part of grind culture as still currently in. And it just taking a step back and being thankful for what you have, you know, family, health, friends, you know, purpose in life. That really is all important. Now, you need money. Like money makes life easier. It gives you options. It gives you flexibility. It gives you opportunities. And it gives you kids opportunities. That's really important. But like I say, it's like the only people who remember when you work late is your kids. Right? And I know. So I'm very self-aware. Like I'm aware that I'm a narcissist. But also I'm aware that I am very bad at work life balance. And you know, trying to burn the candle at both ends and have multiple jobs and careers and also a grown and shown with this channel and cracking out mock draft 75.6. Like I'm fully aware that I have a very addictive personality and I've known it for a long time. That's why I'm very careful when it comes to drinking. I'm very careful because I know that maybe I like it too much. And that's a sign. Also, it's one of the reasons why I don't like I play some poker, sure. But one of the reasons why I don't like gamble in the pit like, well, play a little bit of crap to take that back. But like slot machines, slot machines, table games, I've seen people, even like people close to me like really ruin their lives by that. And I know myself with a addictive personality, gotta stay away from that. It's why I've never really gotten into hard drugs. Oh, sidebar. So when my father was dying of cancer, they had him on all these pain meds, right? And he had like a, all right. So you know, like one of those travel toiletry bags, which is you on zip it and go to to to to to to. He had one of those with like oxy cotton, oxy codone and for curiosity sake, I just tried an oxy one time and it was the first and only time I've ever tried oxy. I had a surgery in injuries and I've declined it because that one time that I tried it, I knew, you know, knowing my personality that this will be very, very bad. And also I mean, there's tons of stories out there about people getting addicted to paint kills, uh, painkillers. I mean, Ryan Leif is a prime example. He's made a recovery, uh, respect that. But I knew because it was like sunshine on my brain. I knew that. Also, do you ever meet someone that you're like really attracted to, but you know that this person will ruin your life? Yeah, it was like that with oxy cotton. I just like got to avoid that. What am I talking about? Oh, so it just slowing things down and just like making sure to take time for yourself and also your family. It's really important because, uh, so we got three kids and, you know, the wife and I were, we got away from having dinner at the table for like, for like a year, right? And something as simple as that because, you know, we're into watching, like our show, like we were watching Yellowstone or something like that. And so we'd have dinner on the couch and the kids would be watching their, uh, watching their Netflix show or Disney show or on the tablets, whatever, eating their friggin' ramen noodles because that's all that they want all the time. Hmm. But we recently, we just got back to eating dinner at the table and no electricity and electronics, no TV, no nothing. And it's something that I really value and I really cherish. And again, it's something small and it may seem trivial, but, you know, sitting down, you know, 20, 30 minutes, talking about your days, cracking jokes. So, uh, my middle kid, Rocco, like his thing right now is just, uh, so he's very aware that he's Asian, but he's half Asian, right? But he likes to make himself look as Asian as possible. So, uh, especially when he's, like, like he made a joke he tried before. He's so, he'll make one of his jokes like knock, knock, who's there? Potato, potato, who? Potato. Something like that. And then he'll just like, hmm. Ha ha ha. Uh, again, it seems silly, but it's amazing. Plus, the really into playing rock paper scissors right now, but it'll be like, rock paper scissors, nuke. They're just creating things. It's funny. It's funny, man. But, uh, I don't know, like, I know that I can definitely get into the weeds with work. I know that I can definitely get into the weeds with content, mock draft 79.2, but I don't know, like, I feel like there, there is a healthy balance like this weekend. There will be mercifully note. Well, so first off, I know that I definitely get a little bit too much into the weeds when it's like three in the morning. I have to get up at like six for, for something. And it's like, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm balls deep in the Dan Brugler beast reading about a priority free agent, uh, wide receiver. Joshua, Joshua, Seffis. He's going to be the one that takes us to the promised land. We have two seventh round picks. That's when he knows just like, okay, maybe she gets some sleep. Yeah. So I don't know, get some sleep, get some steps in, drink some water, everything in moderation, I don't know, I don't know, but yeah, I, so this weekend, like, one of my favorite things like having a picnic with the kids and whether it's going to be great and we're literally just going to make sandwiches and have some fruit and go out and kick the ball and it's good times. And I feel like it's very easy to get away from that, especially when you are in grind mode, especially if you have a lot of plates spinning and yeah, like I'm, I'm cognizant that I'm very bad at it and sometimes I need to improve on and I feel like at the end of the day, like we said, who's going to remember that you work late and just your kids? All right. So take time for yourself, take time for friends of family, take time for all that because I mean, work is work is work. It will always be there. And there always be time for another mock draft. I don't know what we accomplished, but it's beautiful Friday. What we call, it calls like philosophical Friday. It's probably pretty good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv55suOZU7Q,Josy," I guess people are starting to wake up now. Hey guys, welcome back. Welcome back to the center. Welcome back to another video. Actually I came across a video yesterday and it was of a young man who was actually of Asian descent. I don't know if he was Chinese or not, but essentially he broke down into tears crying on his video as he was recalling some of the events of his life. And ultimately what it boiled down to is he realized that at the end of the day or at least his opinion was that no one cared. No one cared about him. No one cared about you. No one cared about anything except themselves. They only cared about how is everything going to benefit me? How are you going to benefit me? What can I take from you? And theoretically present this false projection of friendship where you within inversely believe that they would be there for you like you were there for them only to realize that if and when that moment comes they turn their back on you. They tell you no. They don't help you. They don't care about you. They reveal themselves. They show their hand in this sad and tragic life rant where he literally just bawled and broke out into tears as he almost was realizing this revelation real time on this video. Which I hate to say it. I don't want to make any generalizations. I don't want to make create any stereotypes. It is what it is. Folks, this is the world we live in. You know it. I know it. There are some folks out there that perhaps maybe you've had great relationships with that you still have great relationships with. And maybe there's some folks out there that you had great relationships with that you don't anymore because things change. People change. And the effect of the challenges that we face, the burden, the worry, the panic, the anxiety, the stress, the fear, the crisis, the problems, everything that's going on right now is affecting people differently. Cyber attacks, China attacking us or at least allegedly attacking us. And the possibility of World War III, the uncertainty of the jobs market, the risks that we all face financially in 2024 with the U.S. economy going down the toilet, the inability to ever buy an affordable home, ever again, inflation, recession, stock market crash, job loss, unemployment, election year, 2024. There is so much going on. It's unbelievable. It's unreal. And I also think that in watching this video and seeing this young man's reaction, very, very young, I think, but not going to lie, sometimes Chinese people, or not Chinese, just Asian people was kind of hard to tell. They age really well basically, which ironically there's actually a thing now where you can calculate your age. And now they're saying that people are aging slower. They're aging at a fraction of a percentage of the years that they've been on Earth on this life. So if you're 60 years old, but you're aging at a rate of 0.7%, or 70%, then theoretically then you'd be like 42 years old. It's weird how they do this math. But with that being said, as I read it, I was like, this is interesting because folks are trying to live longer. And then we're all at that, I guess, if you want to be here. But folks are trying to live longer. And unfortunately, those who are on social security and or banking on social security will understand and realize the problem that that would create with people living longer and drawing social security longer. Just saying. A little bit off topic. But with that, I think it comes, I think it does connect. I think it does relate from the standpoint of waking up. And this is not talking about being woke or woke movement or anything like that. Or if you saw Saturday night live with Adam Driver and who killed Han Solo. But either way, the simple fact of the matter is people are waking up. They're waking up and they're understanding and they're witnessing and accepting the truth and the reality of who people are or who people can be. Or what is happening or what is likely to happen next. They are waking up, which is good because I think once you begin to identify the problem, then you can begin to solve the problem. And it's literally like kind of going back to school and they would give you a word problem in math or whatever, whatever class it was. And you know, you kind of restate the problem in the answer. But in order to do that, you have to be able to identify the problem. So by seeing these videos and these young men having these monologue discussions and conversations on camera is showing me that we are actually progressing in a direction that could potentially prove to be positive and beneficial. In the long run, so long as it doesn't get suppressed or it doesn't get shadow banned or restricted or blocked or taken down or canceled or whatever, by whatever deep state operate operatives out there that ultimately wants to continuously tear down. Anyone or any group of people or organization trying to actually do some beneficial good for the overall greater good of society, mankind, the human race, however you want to describe it. And that's where we are today, folks. A little bit of a wake up call. I think you call it a life rant. I think it was a life rant, which you know, I don't want to just rant. I do want to try to provide some aid and information and education and help and support. And if you want to communicate, contact, feel free, reach out. I know a lot of people don't have people to talk to or perhaps maybe the people they do have to talk to aren't really listening to them. And I think that perhaps if you are a subscriber, if you have been watching for a while and you kind of have an idea who I am and who we are and what we do and how we think and how we feel. And just extending that offer to you, whereas if you do want someone to rant to about your life, then hey, we're all ears.",life RANT [crying],12.12.2023,SqT Life,Man,40s,8:01,10,"-0,9944"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvKRQno47L0,Josy, Tell someone life sucks and they immediately become in repair mode and try to fix you or try to fix themselves and say no life doesn't suck how can you say that that's so negative and you're castigated you feel like oh you are an outsider looking into a world that can be discovered beyond happy smiley faces. When you embrace that life sucks stuff goes wrong all the time things break down relationships you get your heart broken you lose jobs you have money struggles the world's at war people always fight they gossip they lie if you go in with that attitude that life sucks it's so contradictory to the way we've been conditioned the way we be conditioned is be happy if you for example if someone asks how you're doing usually they don't care when they ask how you're doing that condition responses oh I'm wonderful I'm great I'm fabulous I'm doing well I'm good thanks for asking I love to say yeah I'm terrible I'm doing really really horrible and the see people's reaction what really what happened what's wrong what's the problem is there anything I could do to help it's like we automatically want to fix ourselves we cannot tolerate being unhappy because we have this expectation that we're supposed to be happy that life's supposed to be great that we're supposed to be successful that we're supposed to have the right job the right relationship the right house the right partner and this is just not the way life works so what we do is we spend all our lives rearranging all the puzzle pieces pieces to make us happy and boom falling on their face boom get bumped boom get arrows in the heart boom get punched get dad get daggers in our back and then we can't understand why we are not happy and it's this constant treadmill approach I need to be happy okay I'm going to be happy this is what I have to do happy I'll read this book or I'll talk to this person or I'll make this change so that's the very complex complement a complicated way of trying to be happy it's like trying to juggle tennis balls or knives or swords and each you know every hour someone adds another sword another sword and you're constantly trying to juggle and make everything work when you go in to life it's like going into a movie the moment someone tells me a movie this is the greatest movie it's fantastic you love it yeah it's amazing and you think oh my gosh I can't wait to see this movie and your expectations are way up here and you go and you see the movie and you're like oh my god that was terrible but if you go in a movie that you let's say you're a girlfriend your boyfriend or your wife or spouse dragged you into and everyone said this movie stinks this movie you're not going to like it it's dumb it's corny it has no plot the acting horrible your expectations are so low that you might actually enjoy the movie that's not going to win Academy where do you mean you're not it's you're not going to love it you probably won't see it again but the chance of you enjoying it is going to be a lot greater what shifted the movie was still the same what shifted is your intention attitude and approach and expectation more importantly before you go when you went and see this movie well life is the same way life sucks get used to it except it there's drama people are complaining all the time it's not it's not a picnic and you want to know what the good news is is the good news is we would have it no other way why do you think we love the news we love negative news that's why they're always showing violence and murders and war on TV because believe me if good news reported good news uplifting stories positive things that people getting along people helping out and volunteering for each other if that got ratings and made money it would be on TV all the time but we love challenge struggle when things go wrong we don't like when things always go our way in the matrix they had a great scene when they talked about how they originally did the computer programming when they had all the people plugged into the matrix the first program was everything was perfect smooth love peace happiness enjoy everybody got along and all the pods all the humans died there's something deep within us that needs that turmoil the struggle the challenge it like refines us and helps us grow but yet at the same on the on one hand we need that on the other hand we resist it and it's not the problems that causes to suffer the challenges those are can be blessings in the skies what causes us to suffer is our resistance to it i shouldn't feel like that we're like we're like little kids all grown up in adult bodies spoiled little brats i can't believe that person said this to me i can't believe i didn't get the job oh my god what's gonna happen this person doesn't like me uh things aren't going my way and we're constantly in that that friction mode friction friction and we blame the problems we blame life instead of looking in the mirror and saying what is my approach what is my approach what is my expectation am i expecting these things to work out because if you are you're a fool you're you're you're and you're up so you're fooling yourself and you're creating your own suffering so when you say okay life sucks get over it and then you can move on and then you go in it's like going into a movie with low expectations you don't have these expectations a plan other people you don't have these high perfectionist expectations upon yourself you don't have expectations upon your job it's you're not trying to extract your happiness externally because you realize everything you need resides within and as within so without so and most people live their entire lives reverse in a chaotic world where there's continuous problems and then they can't understand why they're unhappy and we always think that next carrot if I could only get this that will make me happy and it's this constant walking and bumping into walls so freedom liberation is realizing our true nature getting centered and saying you know if you if it's meditation works for you if it's stillness just something magical about stillness just being still and we claiming your energy and going within and then you realize hmm man despite the chaos outside outside in the real world everything's cool everything's legit everything's a okay and then you're not reactionary right now most people live their lives reactionary oh this person did this to me you know just constant constant suffering that we that self created so man that's great news life sucks life sucks and in that you bring different energy to challenges and when things go wrong you learn you grow you prosper when things go wrong because when life doesn't go your way it reveals your true character it reveals your true nature it reveals your weaknesses it reveals your strengths and it tells you what your homework is and normally we blame other people other situations for unhappiness instead of saying hmm I'm unhappy about this and that is my assignment that is my homework I have to do some self examination some stillness meditation whatever it is we center myself and find out why I am tossed like a read in the wind based on what happens externally oh man when you know life sucks and that there's just tremendous suffering in the world you can be at peace because you're loving things as they are and there's this you're putting out the fire of resistance and enjoy it it's a it's a joy ride once you get on it and once you start becoming a conscious of how often we are in resistance mode and we have this false ideal that life is supposed to be grandiose we're supposed to be life is supposed to make us happy we're supposed to be successful we're supposed to be excellent at things we do we're supposed to have people like us have money in the bank once you say oh man no all that's just all we've been conditioned we've been conditioned to believe all that so we keep on chasing this the the illusion the imaginary carrot that we doesn't doesn't go with us when we die and it's so temporary and let's return to what is real what is important and that's just going in we're finding your true nature connecting to your intuition your inner compass and then having the courage to live

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hSm7nvih5U,Josy," So today I want to talk about how life is so meaningless that nothing matters. So then we get to these slums of not wanting to do anything because we feel like nothing matters. But you are correct. I don't want to be like pessimistic in any way but I'm going to be because that's who I actually am. So you know, we go through life hoping that there's some sort of meaning. This is really funny story. I did an exam to get into film school once. We are talking about life. That's weird. And it is like this really random question about technology. And then I just went on a whole rant about how life is meaningless and we are just trying to do everything we can to grasp some sort of meaning because ultimately the feeling of having no meaning scares us because we're taught that meaning is everything. In the question schools, like, oh, you have to put meaning to this sentence that Shakespeare said, you have to put meaning. There is something behind. You have to read between the lines and whatever because we're always searching for meaning. But meaning doesn't exist. I'm sorry to say, but meaning does not exist. So what is there? Most times when I think about that, then I don't want to do anything for life. I'm like, oh, I have so many talents. Yeah, but at the same time, I don't want to profit off of them because I mean, I don't want to do them because then I'm always thinking about how I can profit off of my talents. And then that doesn't make it fun because I hate the idea of money. And then I am doing anything. You guys do that? I don't know. So I just sit in bed all day because I'm like, this is so pointless. But then when I think about dying, I get sad. And I get scared. And I'm like, oh, I want to have a long life. But then if I have to live, then I have to have a profit, unfortunately. So it's just a constant battle. I feel like we go through life in constant fear and constant stress because that's what we're taught in the beginning. See life for what it is and not for what it isn't or the solution that we created in order for us to feel like we have some sense of purpose. And it matters in the physical world, obviously. But once we die, we just kind of become energy again and disperse and become something else. And yeah, we can spend our whole lives stressing and freaking out and having everything that we've ever wanted and people always talking about. Can money buy happiness or is it can happiness not be bought? And then there's the side where people are like, yeah, money can buy happiness because it can buy you the things that you want that will make and that will make you happy. But people will understand, like, that's just temporary happiness. So long ago, I thought you said that. The big word that we forget basically is temporary. We know that things are temporary, but we try to make them permanent everything. We know that we meet the things in our life. We fight for things even if they're bad for us because we don't like to know what life is like without the things that we're comfortable with. Let's say somebody who grew up in a more wealthy family, right? And then they just lose all their money. And they have to try to live and survive on their own. It's going to feel very unknown and very scary to them. People don't do that intentionally. It's like the last resort that comes to them based on other circumstances. And then they're like, okay, I have to do this. But people don't do that intentionally because they don't want to leave behind that comfortable feeling. So you can see that face in the tree. That's so cute. Love you. And we get so comfortable with our lives and what's going on in them that even thinking about change is scary to us and we keep telling ourselves things like find where I am and find where I am or we say things like, oh, I can never be able to do that. But it's literally just your fear talking because you can get up one morning and throw all your money and just see how life takes you. You know what I mean? I'm not saying to do that. I'm just saying, you can. But you're choosing not to. Like the more you talk about your risk factors, the more you're going to put fear into yourself. And fear is the biggest block between you and this temporary reality because the fear makes you feel like this reality is permanent. What I'm trying to say is just live it. And there's this one song from this artist named Stokel. Something we might be dead by tomorrow, I think. And it's so true. Life is so unexpected. Anything can happen to you. So why are we sitting here with so much regret and so much pain and so much stress in our lives that kills us faster than life itself? Ah, peace it. Peace it out, man. Anyways, that's my little rant for the day. Or a little nature talk for today. Now let's go for some nature together and I'll show you the amazing things that it has to offer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c39MEXiVY1Q,Josy," One of the things that scares me the most in life is losing myself. I guess my interest as a child, like the dreams that I had, as a child, as a young adult, to lose those things, you know, I see almost all of the adults in my life at some point had to give up on their dreams, gave up on their dreams for money or most of the time it was for money or a career, but they just gave up. And I don't know if it's possible to go through life without losing yourself a little bit. You know, I understand that we evolve as humans as we go through life. You get better, you evolve, you become different. But it still pains me to think about losing myself like that. You know, one of my dreams is to buy some land and build a cabin on it. And, you know, I tell myself that I would never give up on that dream, but, and I won't. But, you know, those kinds of dreams, that's what I'm talking about. Those are the kinds of things that scare me. Like, spending the next 40 years at a job that I am only doing it for money. Like, that, that terrifies me or to stop traveling, to stop exploring, to stop spending time outside. Like, it seems like right now, whatever those things are for you, it seems like, you know, that's impossible. I would never lose myself. I would never sacrifice those things for comfort or just because I'm lazy. But I really think we would. Like, if you're a younger person and you still have those dreams and you haven't given up on them, protect them. Because you will, man, the world today just sucks the life out of adults. Like, when I, when I got my first job at a high school, I was working at Walmart. I worked there for about a year. And, you know, I was still, I was full of excitement. You know, I graduated high school. I was ready to start life, you know. I was full of life and, and, and ready for adventure. I was just excited to be alive, you know. Very much is I, I'm still that way today. I don't want to lose that. And that's the point, you know, when I went to that job for the first time. And I saw, you know, my managers, even so my coworkers that were five, 10 years older than me. And I just, like, people walk around like their zombies, you know. And I get it. That job sucks. But you can do something about it. Like part of the reason that I was so happy is because I knew Walmart wasn't my indestination. You know, I knew it was just a step in the, in getting to where I wanted to end up. Given I haven't gotten there yet, but that's how I treat every single thing. Like I'm still chasing that dream. And I think so many of these adults, you know, when you sacrifice everything for money, you no longer have dreams. I think that's why people walk around just emotional, emotionless, just like miserable. And it's because they have nothing left. Like they've sacrificed all of their dreams for money. And, you know, I just, I see that as one of the most tragic things in life. So, yeah, don't lose your younger self. Don't lose that part of you that wakes up every day excited for the adventure. That part of you that has dreams. Don't, don't sacrifice that for money or, or status. Because I mean, just look around you. It's not worth it. Like, yeah. Yeah. Don't sacrifice that part of yourself. So, yep. It's all gone for today. Talk soon.",I'm Scared Of LOSING My Younger Self,22.11.2024,Ponderings,Man,20s,5:20,7,"0,9981"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL5cO7MWmEs,Andre," Shears the wee goby. Because we go, we'll not let me be great. We go to say no man, no man, we're not going to do it to yourself. And I love it. It's a good morning. Good morning, it's Sugar O'Connor. And I am back for what I eat in a day video. I just want to share with you guys what I eat in a day. On my video I saw this morning, ask for help because they say they get bored, they need suggestions, what to eat because that's their problem. They get bored with eating the same foods all the time. And I get it because I'm the same way. And I think that's one of the reasons why my weight loss is not consistent. Like, some people could lose three or four pounds every week because they eat the same stuff over and over. But that's not me. I get bored with food. If I eat the same thing maybe two days I'm done with it. That's why I don't really like the meal per. two people to comment and my last what I eat in a day vlog and they told me about this fair life milk because it gives you more protein than the regular milk because I used to do almond milk but my dietitian suggested I go back to regular milk because almond milk doesn't have a lot of nutritional value in it as far as protein on this journey we need the protein so I am so glad that the ladies told me about this fair life milk because the fat-free fair life milk it has zero fat it has six grams of carbs and 13 grams of protein I need that because the regular milk only have eight grams of protein it has way more carbs and this is apple strawberry Cheerios apple strawberry Cheerios so I'm gonna do a cup and a half that's my serving a cup and a half one cup half a cup now they'll say I'm grossing all out but I like to put ice in my cereal my ice I got a half a cup of raspberry y'all I like to put raspberry in my cereal too when about half banana then I'll do raspberry half a cup and they gives me extra fiber as well I'm gonna do one cup of a fair life milk so with this bowl of cereal and everything of course it's not a lot of protein so I'm gonna have one of those beats pickle eggs that I showed y'all that I made I'm just gonna eat one only one just one of them it's up to you you know how many you eat but I just feel one egg will be fine I'm gonna have one egg so I can have some extra pros and I want my protein to be over 20 20 grams seven grams of fiber 41.1 grams of carbs 6.5 grams of fat 22.9 grams of protein so just say 23 grams of protein now some people may say 21 that's a lot of carbs not for me my daily count according to my dietitian is 140 per day according to my doctor 130 per day so I just got to make sure I watch it for my next two meals and I already tracked my lunch what I'm going to have lunch because I had the same thing yesterday for lunch and I had it last night for dinner and I'm going to eat again today for lunch but I'm going to add something different to it and I'll share that with you when I come back I will be back it's 11.33 I started warming up my leftovers I took my lunch break today at 11.30 instead of 12 because your girl is hungry that's the only thing about when I don't eat around 35 40 grams of protein I get hungry faster for lunch time I did not have any snack at all and I've been trying not to snack until later in the day around two thirty three o'clockish with that being said right here is the brown rice this is the brown jasmine rice and this is a three-fourth cup I'm adding some cups from Dollar Tree these are the three-fourth cups and this right here is the half a cup so you can see the difference in the two to half a cup it's a lot smaller so I'm going to put it in here because you can't microwave these just all thing about these I'm going to put it in this bowl and then I'm going to put it in my microwave so heat up my brown rice so I like when it makes a little shape like this a little round shape and so I'm going to go ahead and warm everything up in a microwave for about 40 seconds and I'll be right back okay so I want to heat it the rice now what I'm going to do you guys I am going to bring over my okra intamatos that I cooked I cooked okra intamatos yesterday cut up onion in it and I um I added some uncle john's smoked sausage so what I'm going to do I'm going to serve a cup and a half of the okra tomatoes with the onions first by itself and then I'm going to measure my uncle john's sausage to make sure I'm getting just four ounces of sausage so let me do that real quick so this is the you come closer to the oven see me just the okra and tomatoes okra intamatos so now I'm going to have put my okra intamatos in here one cup and now I'm going to do a half a cup of this half a cup okra intamatos so I got one and a half cup of okra intamatos three four cups of jasmine brown rice now some people don't like stuff like this and this is one of these are a lot of people don't like to track because you got to separate your meat out and all that stuff I could have just you know put everything that's together and divide it by so many servings but it always don't work out that way and sometimes you track more than what you actually eat or you try less than what you actually eat so to make sure that I'm getting the right servings of everything I take my meat out when I do stuff like this so I'm gonna go ahead and turn this put them into it like this I'm gonna take this half a cup thing here let me turn it off I'm gonna put this on my smart way let me see if I can do it like this so yeah I can see it though sorry make others know us let me come down like this so you can see it okay so here's my smart way still and I'm gonna turn it on so it can zero it out with this on there okay and so I'm gonna put on units make sure I got it on ounces and pounds okay and pound it ounces so can you see it I can see it good so I want to do four ounces of sausage that's 1.2 you know I might just do what I got let's drink one too I think I'm gonna do one piece okay so what's that 3.6 ounces that was a silly and I'm gonna be full there you go four ounces oh I need one more okay so there's four ounces of umpajana sausage okay so now we have the three-fourth cup of brown rice it's just back to the up the scene and down okay so now we have the three-fourth cups of brown rice the one and one half cup of the Oakland tomatoes the four ounces of sausage now hoping I could eat all this y'all but I definitely had this yesterday for lunch now for dinner I did not eat as much I did only a half a cup of the rice and one cup of the Oakland tomatoes that in the evening I really eat a lot so I kind of you know scale back but I'm gonna put in here four ounces of shrimp I just cooked four ounces of shrimp I'm gonna add that just to give me a little bit more protein and I'm gonna splang to y'all so yesterday you guys I missed my protein go by seven I only had seven seventy three grams of protein yesterday my car since red on tray I had a hundred and thirty one cars because you know my doctor said I can have 130 cars my nutritionist said I can have it till 140 so the way I said it in my fitness pal when you put in the percentages it always kind of put it at 131 or 133 for some reason but it got it at 131 so I hit red at 131 but I went over on my fat by 27 that was because of the sausage the sausage got a lot of fat so I'm gonna make sure I don't eat this again later today which I won't so altogether this is 726 calories 48.2 grams of protein 33.5 grams of fat and 54.3 grams of carbs now when I look at my total for today so far for both of those meals it comes up to 71 grams of protein which means I still have nine more grams of protein to eat for today to hit my minimum goal total 95 grams of carbs that's why I said I'm not worried about that 54 grams of carbs because I still have more left my goal is a hundred and thirty four today according to my doctor 140 according to my dietitian but I try to always shoot towards the 130 so with that being said I still have what 30 plus another five I still have 34 grams of carbs for the first day so that's why I say don't get upset if you eat a lot of carbs in one meal just balance it out no because you don't go over your daily goal um fiber 13 grams of fiber so I still need 12 for today to hit my minimum and then for fat total is 40 I still have 10 more um left for today I would not be eating this meal again later so I don't have to worry about going over my fat like I did on yesterday but on yesterday I did really good um I had this meal twice yesterday however I did not eat the same portion size yesterday I didn't have any shrimp at all um what I did was I ate um one cup of the ochre tomatoes instead of a cup and a half and then I had um a half a cup of rice instead of three fourth cups of rice and I like I said I didn't have any shrimp so that's what I had for dinner on yesterday but I missed my goal by seven on my protein I even out my carbs I did 131 because that's what my fitness pal calculates for me is 131 when I put in the percentage rates I can never get that 130 every time I change my weight and I redo my calculation it never gets me that 130 I was putting me a few over 130 so again I hit daddy than at 131 on yesterday with the carbs my fiber it says that I had 22 grams of fiber out of 25 and then my fat I went over so I missed my fiber by three I missed my protein by seven and I went over my fat by 27 I went over big time yesterday that's because I ate the meal twice yesterday and that sausage has a lot of fat in it so but I'm okay because at the end of the day I do not eat my fitness extra points that I say I can eat my extra calories because according to my fitness pal on yesterday I was able if I wanted to eat 29 more calories from a five minute workout I did seven and I more calories from a 15 minute walk I did 481 calories from me doing my bicycle for 45 minutes yesterday so that kind of take care of me going over my fat by 27 and yesterday I did go over my calorie count by 57 I actually had 1557 yeah calories yesterday 1557 I went over about 57 and I'm okay I know I went over yesterday which is fine with me because yesterday I had some ice cream I had three fourth cups of the ice cream though I didn't eat a whole cup but yeah I went over my calories by 57 which was fine I didn't go to bed hungry I was fine and again all of the calories let's see 500 yeah so I couldn't eat it in an additional almost 600 calories according to my fitness pal but of course I'm under that is what it looks like ochre tomatoes onions and other giant sausage so good so good so good put some shrimp on here the shrimp hey y'all it's twine I'm back I tried to eat on my food and I couldn't eat it all so we go to be one let me be great oh my goodness so we go to be great now let me tell y'all I took the fill of me today today it's Friday I used to gonna take the Finch of Me on Fridays but I made up my mind that I was gonna try this week of taking my half a tablet finish every single day instead of doing three or four days like I normally do because I'm thinking that's the reason that my weight loss may have slowed down because I stopped doing a half a tablet every day and only mainly would do it like on Mondays and Tuesdays the days that I know that we go we kind of have this half life and it's time for me to re-give myself the next injection I know those of days that I really excuse me overeat like on Mondays and Tuesday so I really be needing to finish me on Mondays but I decided that I was gonna start taking the Finch of Me every day you know because Wednesday is like the first day of the week for me since that's my injection day and I actually took one Wednesday I took one yesterday Thursday and now I'm taking one today but it won't let me eat all this food I'm gonna let me eat it all I couldn't even drink all my food and this is a Dr. Pepper strawberry and cream zero sugar let me show you how much soda that though put in this glass oh so y'all can see it though I'm just gonna find some glass bowls and dishes so when I show you how food I can see stuff this is how much soda that look like a half a can probably about a half a can because that's what it feel like so I'm gonna finish sitting on my soda before it goes flat and let me show you how much food I have let me get um I still have let's see I still have two shrimp left one two sausage I got one two three four five pieces of sausage left and I know how much ochre and tomatoes let's measure this out and see I want to be on the money with this and this is the thing about this journey guys that we own you know sometimes you feel that you can't a lot in your mind tell you that but you'll be able to say we ain't doing that we did four ounces of sausage okay so that's zero let's put the sausage in there okay I'm getting all right some stuff on it one more piece of sausage in here that's one point five ounces y'all see that one point five ounces of sausage so I ate two point five you got one point five love okay so let's zero it out again let me turn it off so I can zero it out again turn it um okay my shrimp we got two love pieces of shrimp see how much that is okay so we ate three point three ounces in other shrimp because that's zero point seven ounces so yeah now let me see something here I wonder how much other other stuff I want to this one this is a one third cup serving here I'm going to see if that's how much rice and stuff we have left put this over here I'm gonna eat this later y'all I'm not throwing my food away this might be more than this might be a half a cup I'm gonna get a half a cup size thing I'm gonna put this rice ochre and tomato this little in here one whole half cup that's the thing about when you own this journey you can kind of look at when you measure in food you can kind of look at stuff and eyeball it until I look at it and I said the home is gonna be a little bit more than that so that's why I got the one half so I got one half cup of brown rice ochre and tomatoes left point seven of shrimp and what was that 1.5 of sausage left okay I like a way to cover on it I'll eat that later so yeah that's the thing about when you first take your injection you know that first day or two when you first take the wigovi you can kind of like you know eat you know all of your allow calories but then Friday Saturday and Sunday I told y'all sometimes I'm out of the eat like one meal you know and then I have maybe a snack and then a protein shape you know something like that because yeah but it's morning y'all saw I had the cereal and stuff and now that so that's gonna be my dinner y'all that's gonna be my dinner I'm telling you I'm gonna finish the rest of my doctor peple I just had to share that with y'all sometimes we think that we can eat a lot but always always two days out of that injection we over say I'm not gonna let you be great I'm stopping you so thorough and that's why I love taking my injection on Wednesday this is a proven fat y'all two days after like that doctor said that doctor on you too I gotta find him again so I can share him with y'all I'm gonna go back to look at one of my old videos so I can get it because I know I put his link of that video when he was saying that and one of my old videos when I first started this journey over a year ago but that doctor said do your injection on Wednesday because it takes about two days for you to really get the full effects of that medicine and that's when you need it to work for you the most is the weekends because the weekends is when people eat the most calories so when you take it on a Wednesday Friday Saturday Sunday it's stopping you honey I just showed you it just stopped wanting her tracks cheers to we go there because we go we're not let me be great mm-hmm we go to say no man no man we're not going to do it to yourself and I love it okay you guys I am back it is 3 27 3 27 I'm in the kitchen real quick gonna grab me a snack I told you out for some reason I always always crave something sweet around 3 3 30 so I'm gonna have one of these Clio yogurt bars they um strawberry vanilla I'm gonna take one of them out and I'm gonna have that um they both have eight grams of fat which is good because I told you I only have 10 more grams of fat today this is 16 carbs so it's gonna give me more carbs and this is a hundred and 60 calories for the vanilla 170 for strawberry I'm gonna do the vanilla so I pulled that one out first and yeah so this is running my meat they smacked so good usually Friday Saturday Sunday I do the don't even eat this time of the day after I get my snack in I do the thing I use to be done and if I do eat something it might be another little light snack or something like that 29 p.m. oh Siri but I'm gonna make sure I eat the rest of that food because I want to get the rest of my own protein and I don't want to waste you know shrimp and stuff that I actually cook so yeah this might be the end for me y'all because I use it don't really eat after I do my snack like I said if I do it used to be something to kind of put some extra protein in my body or something like that but yeah it's what I eat in the day if I eat something else then I'll record more for the video but if I don't be in the angle size that that wouldn't be my caloric intake for the day so I'm gonna go ahead and scan this real quick and see here's the thing when I scan this it came up to 140 versus what the box say I don't know my fitness pal always kind of be off sometime I don't know why so that being said that gives me a total of 80 grounds of protein 108 grounds of carbs for the whole day I did good I still have 23 carbs left fat that put me at 46 grounds of fat I still have four love which you know I'm not going to eat that fiber that put me at 14 grams of fiber so if anything I probably need to eat some fruit to get some more fiber in me if I do a whole cup of these it give me 82 protein 115 carbs 22 fiber 47 fats so that's good so I'm only short by three fiber and I still have 16 more carbs left I still have three more fat which I'm not gonna have so what I'm gonna end up doing I'm gonna drink some binoc fiber to give me those other three that I need my diet patients have to drink some binoc fiber or metal musa to give me a little bit extra fiber um that being said if I eat anything additional I will come back and I will add it to the tracker and I will come back in video but then I'm gonna try to get this video and with those of you who want to know I'm struggling what can I eat here's something and I will do more videos of these for you guys have a god bless day and enjoy your weekend",HOW I LOST WEIGHT & CHANGED MY MINDSET | what I eat in a week as a dental

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o3s7r-QZyg,Andre," Hi, I'm Ali and I've been in an aneroxie recovery for a few months now. If you follow me on TikTok, which you definitely could, you've probably seen this job before. This is my fear fruit jar filled with fear fruits and fruit challenges that I know I need to face in order to be fully recovered. If you don't know what a fear food is, it's a food that a person with an eating disorder fears or avoids completely. Not everyone with an eating disorder has fear foods and they can just be so individual from person to person. Lately I've been getting frustrated by how full this jar is and I'm finding new fear foods faster than I can eat them. So today I'll be challenging six fear foods, one at each meal on snack. Feel free to grab something to eat and we can eat together but with all that being said, we face the jar. On today's menu we've got ramen and milkshake filled biscuit bar food from the freezer section. I'm like mohon and grapes. I don't know what I was expecting from a day of fear food, but I'm scared. Okay, I'm going to plan up my day a little bit and I will see you at breakfast. I'll eat someone's excited for it. I haven't challenged any of them. I haven't challenged bacon or cheese and I've rarely challenged sauce. I don't know what I'd rate it. So appearance out of 10. I'm shaking. Honestly, it can't really taste the sauce. So kind of hoping they like, they've got it. I think they did. That just looks like cheese. I'm eating cheese. I'm eating cheese. The fact that my eating disorder was happy that they forgot the sauce means I have probably challenged that. Then you were improved. You deserve to add sauce to your food. Breakfast is done and that was also sauce and cheese and bacon. That probably wasn't quite enough for a full breakfast though. So I'm going to go get some wheat bits probably because meal endings and also fuel your body adequately. Breakfast, part two. Breakfast is done. I will see you at Morning Tea. It's morning tea time. I've got a mandarin, a protein bar and my grapes. I just wanted to take the opportunity as I'm sitting down with my grapes to reiterate the fact that eating disorders are not logical, they're not rational and they simply do not make sense. So I'm well aware that grapes are maybe a little bit of a ridiculous thing to be afraid of. My eating disorder doesn't care. So I also don't particularly feel like eating morning tea because I am not feeling great after breakfast. My brain is not very happy with me. It's just because it was later than usual. I'm not super hungry but you still need to feel your body. Doesn't matter when you last ate, if you're hungry, even if you're not, if you need to eat your plate. Honestly, how am I going to be scared of grapes? They're just like a small purple mandarin. One of the frustrating things about fear foods is you have to eat them over and over and over again until you're not scared of them anymore. You can't expect to just have it once and then be cured. I think I have to have protein bars every day for maybe two weeks before I stopped being so scared of them. If I had had it once and then not had it again, I think I would have gone back to being just as scared of it as I had been before I challenged it. So just keep challenging and it does get easier. One in tea. Done. I'll see you all later. It's lunchtime. Let's check another time. I think freezer foods scare me because they kind of feel like takeaway and my brain just equates like fast food with the weight gain. But that's so silly but like nothing bad is going to happen because it has another sponge. It's just another form of fuel which my body needs and your body needs the all-need fuel. love it's cured. The fact that I actively avoided having it means it's still a bit of food. Also, who is having nuggets without sauce anyway? Not me. I've been gaining weight consistently for the last few weeks and earlier this week I outgrew my favorite pair of jeans which has kind of contributed to pretty rough body image, which in turn makes eating more difficult. If the only way I can fit into a certain size of clothes is by restricting my food and mistreating my body, then it's not really the right size for me. Honestly, chicken nuggets and chocolate milk is like the perfect lunch. A lunch five year old mate would have been stoked with this. Lots of people in my comments on my TikTok purse was talking about how their family calls a clean plate a happy plate and I love that. So proud of my mum of the happy plate club. I'll see you at afternoon tea. It is once again time to eat. For afternoon tea I've got a yogurt and my filled biscuit ball. You know I'm wasting any of it. You're wasting any of it. Your buddy needs it all. I think the reason the biscuit scammy is because it's like you've got the biscuit. You've also got the filling. It's like two in one which my brain is like that's so unnecessary. I have the biscuit or just have the filling but you can't just have the filling. So that doesn't make sense. Open your eyes. I'm going to take away from her. It's just filled. It's not going to hurt. That is so good. Oh my gosh. It tastes so good. This is insane. That was such a good afternoon tea. I will see you at dinner. Fifth meal of the day. This one is kind of a big one. That smells so good. I have always really loved Japanese food. The guilt was really eating this afternoon. After afternoon tea. I really was not feeling dinner at all. I wasn't feeling this video at all. I was feeling pretty bad about my buddy image as well. But the thing is, sooner I gain weight, the sooner I get to return to normal life. And yes, that might be in a bigger body than I am in now. But that will be because it's the body I need to be in. I'm even disaughted that I don't get to eat my favorite fruits anymore. Where does that energy come up with that? Just what I would like to know. This is banging. And for some reason, I'm not allowed to have it. Like, sir, what if I gain weight? If I'm gaining weight, it's because I need to. I think people underestimate how exhausting recovery is as well. Because your body is working so hard to keep functioning and to gain weight if you need to. And to repair any damage that's been caused, it takes such a physical toll. But mentally, you're constantly fighting. This is like other half of you. And I wish people understood that recovery genuinely is a full-time job. You can't just give it 10% of your time and energy if you want to fully recover. You have to give it more than that. I was dreading that all day and I did it. I almost gave up off-dial for noontae. You know, you know how I'm done? Nobody needs to know that I was defeated by Roman. But I would have known. And I don't want to lose to a bowl of soup. Anyways, I'm off for some distraction before the guilt sets in. And I will see you at supper. Last meal of the day. Got the shake. This one is like near-polaritan flavor. Can't put a life on me decide if that means it's like three-flaming in one or if it's just one flavor. I'm going to say that's thickening off. That smells so good. That looks really thick too. That's just like drinking melted ice cream. I don't know why it's actually anything different. I actually do really struggle still with the good calories and feeling like they're a waste. But your body still uses other energy. So they're not a waste. One thing that's been really helpful for me to keep in mind is that as much as in that feel like it is, food is not the enemy. Your eating disorder is. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. So it's not you against the food. You and food are on the same side. Or you and your shakes. When you're recovering from eating disorder, food legitimately is your medicine. You will get your brain working again and get your brain to a place where it can fight back against your eating disorder. I just did a whole day of fear foods. Six. In recovery, you don't spend much time feeling proud of yourself. Your eating disorder doesn't let you feel proud of yourself. It just makes you feel bad. But you deserve to feel proud of yourself. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you.","one day, six fear foods | anorexia recovery",16.06.2023,allie,woman,20s,18:25,4,"-0,9374"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Q8WaV0gRM,Andre," Hey guys, welcome back or welcome to my channel, Valerina and home. I'm Jeanette Kakarika, I'm a soloist with the bearishest dance ballet in Munich, Germany. I recently got surgeries for appendicitis. So that's what I'm going to be talking about today. It's going to be a little bit vlog style, but I need to catch you guys up. I think that this video is going to be really beneficial for anybody who isn't necessarily dancer, but is athletic and is trying to figure out answers and trying to understand what's going on with their appendicitis or the pain that they're experiencing. And I just really couldn't find that kind of material when I was looking on the internet, except for like some marathon runners who were dead set on like running a marathon two weeks after their appendicitis. Just to start, there's two things. One is that I'm definitely not a medical professional and I'm definitely not giving medical advice. I'm going to be talking about my own experience. Two, the main point of this whole thing, and if you don't take anything else from this, it is just please, please, please take your pain seriously and if something isn't adding up when you're at the doctors, express that to them. Just make sure that you're communicating with your doctors as best you can. That was my biggest takeaway from this experience. All right, so I wrote it all down so that hopefully I don't miss anything. Basically, I had symptoms of appendicitis for a month before my surgery. Obviously, we're in coronavirus times and so I didn't have any expected performances during this time period. I also was dancing significantly less because after the Christmas holiday, we only came back for a very short time and then some dancers got sick and so they sent everybody home. I wasn't personally quarantined but I only came back after that for one day before my surgeries. So just to give a little context. Okay, so it all began with what I described at the time as a stomach ache. It was just really painful and it had me curled up for several days. I assumed at the time that it was maybe food poisoning because we had tried a new seafood place. The pain slowly started to go down my abdomen and into my lower abdominals and then this is what became known now as shooting pain, which I have said so many times, which was just straight down and I now know that that was my bladder. But I didn't understand that at the time and I kept describing this and trying to Google it and I wasn't getting a lot of answers. So I booked to go see the doctor because the pain just was continuing. At that point, I was thinking maybe it was a bladder infection, maybe it was my first one. I didn't have experience with that so I just I didn't know. And apparently it's very common in women. So the thing is right before my doctor's appointment, my symptoms started to get better. So then when I got there, we took a test and it did say that I did have a bladder infection. So then my doctor just took it for what it was and said, okay, this is what it is. She gave me medicine, of course, for this. Just like didn't really look anymore into it. Little did I know that the symptoms were going to come and go in waves for the next month. I now also know that actually appendicitis can cause, I mean, maybe that's not like the right medical term, but they can cause bladder infections as in it's not abnormal. So I went on this medicine for the bladder infection. My doctor, my general doctor also suggested that I go see a gynecologist. So I went to go see mine. And unfortunately before that, my symptoms had gotten worse again and then they got better. By the time I got see her now, my symptoms were better again, but I realized this was a pattern that things got worse and then better and then worse and then better. So I said that to her, but she basically just gave me like a natural herbal kind of medicine for post bladder infection. And speaking to my friends, I realized that none of this was very normal for a bladder infection. So I just kept googling, but I really couldn't find what the answer was. I really just had pain straight down. It wasn't on my right side. It was on my left side. I didn't really get what it was that I was feeling with the pain, but apparently that's the bladder. All of this dancing wasn't happening a lot, but when we were dancing, I was able to. It really depended on where and the way I was that I could do a lot of physical activity. We're not to a lot of physical activity. I also woke up then sometimes during the night from pain. And that's kind of when I was starting to realize that maybe this was serious. And then I actually didn't feel anything other than the shooting pain except for the night before my surgeries and I finally felt it on my right side. And it felt uncomfortable even to touch it. And I was like, oh my god, okay. I thought, well, maybe it's my appendix, but I really didn't know if this was going to be a surgery situation or what. I booked a doctor's appointment for the next afternoon. She tested for the infection again. I don't think she found anything. She also tested my blood. Wasn't going to come back until the next day anyway. And then she had me wait around for use of the ultrasound room. So she didn't ultrasound. She also had the other doctor there to look. But they couldn't really see much, but they realized it was abnormal. So they wanted to call to book me to see someone at a hospital for like intestinal stuff. But they were on a lunch break. So I left from there. I walked all the way back to work. I then walked to Starbucks. I got myself a tea. I got myself a bagel. I lunch and then I finally got a call from my doctor and she said, okay, yeah, go now. They can see you right now. I walked as fast as I could. So at this appointment, they took more blood and they did an ultrasound. But this time with the blood, they kept a little cap on it because they were like, well, in case we need more later. And I was like, what? The woman who did the ultrasound was like, there is some major swelling. You need to go see the surgeon now. What? I believe that day. I knew I was going to go see the doctor and I knew something was going to happen, but did I really think I was going to have surgery that day? Absolutely not. So I went to the surgeon and he was like, we're going to have to do surgery on you today. And he asked, like, did you eat today? And I said, yeah, I ate like an hour or two ago. And you're really not supposed to eat before surgery if you don't know that already. But I really didn't think I was getting surgery that day. So I thought it did not even cross my mind. And I was hungry and they were taking blood. So I didn't want to pass out, but they were like, we're doing it anyway. So at this point, I think it was like, probably for 430 in the afternoon. They took me straight up. They had me changing. They had me signing a bunch of stuff, translated all the English for me, but luckily the surgeons and all that they can speak English. Oh, also they had to take two really intense corona tests before I was admitted into the hospital. And not two, as in two and two horrible. They got all up in there. And so actually now that I've gone back to work and gotten a test at the feeder, I like can't complain because there's so much more gentle. So I was preparing for the surgery, like super fast. Let's do it. They're changing and I call my fiance in the bathroom because it was all happening so so fast. Oh, it wasn't going to be a lot of visitors because it's corona times. So that sucks. I went into surgery. Honestly, I don't remember much about waking up. By now it was like nighttime staff. I had been in surgery for like three hours. I think that they were saying that they're going to like, debrief me on how it all went the next morning because it was late and the surgeon was going home. And then I, I first was just uncomfortable, but I was like, it's fine. I'm on pain meds. It'll, you know, and I tried to like sit it out. I was like laying there and pain and then eventually it was way too much. And I was like, give me more medicine or something because I'm in so much pain. And apparently they took an ultrasound again, but I have no memory of this whatsoever. And they put me back into surgery because they realized I was still bleeding and that it was an abnormal case of appendicitis. I don't know what that means. But then I was in surgery for another three hours. And by the time I was out, it was like 4.30 in the morning. I accidentally texted my friend instead of my fiance that I was out and it was just like, garbled garbage and I accidentally took a selfie. So the next morning I was so lethargic, so tired, couldn't really move. It was like an effort just to like, move my arms. But that's what they were telling me is that I had to move. I had to move. Otherwise, I wasn't going to be allowed to leave the hospital. I remember two of the nurses forced me to get up and stand up and they wanted me to even walk around. And following that, I was in so much pain and it was not good. It turned out that there was sort of like a bladder situation that they had to resolve and then I was in a lot less pain because my bladder had been swollen and giving me pain and had been infected for a month. This was a symptom of appendicitis. So my appendix presumably had actually been swollen longer than that. Then that day, I think my general doctor called me to apologize. She said, I'm so sorry that we didn't do all the tests the first time. You know, please feel comfortable coming back. You know, she was like very apologetic and realized that we didn't do enough. The first time I came to her, you know, I have to say, although I don't want to like necessarily like blame myself for other patients, at the same time, I now realize that maybe my pain tolerance is slightly different. And I think also at the same time, we're very in tune with her bodies as dancers or athletes even. So if you really don't feel like something makes sense, which I didn't feel like it made sense when I first went to her, you should just speak up about it, especially with like a general doctor. She's not specialized in intestinal medicine. So it's better to speak up and demand more tests and then just be safe. Also the next day when I saw my surgeon, he also apologized to me because I didn't want to surgery twice. They didn't realize how complicated it was and they didn't know until they got in there. They'd actually put a drain in the first surgery. And then when I was complaining about the shooting pain, which was the same pain I said before the first surgery. So it doesn't make sense to me that it would be the drain. They took that out and then I was bleeding more. And are those things related? I don't know because I'm not a medical professional. All I know is what they tell me. The one thing that did help was that even though all I could do is like pretty much lay there. Eventually I was able to like raise the bed up so at least I was sort of laying in like a relaxed position. I could even put my feet up eventually to be sort of almost sitting on my own but with support. I would maybe turn on a yoga with a drain video. Even though I couldn't do absolutely everything, there was something very relaxing and calming about it and at least you know I could maybe do the arms up. I could maybe do like a small like the smallest twist you've ever done in your life and just like breathing exercises. Moving your arms and all that is so important. I was so swollen like my arms like none of this. And I would also say like trying to do breathing is really important. They were really nervous about that because I had been in surgery for six hours. They gave me a tube to make sure I still breathe. They actually had a machine for me to blow into to make sure I had the lung capacity to do so. It was quite funny. They also gave me a sheet on like doing like little feet exercises. But yeah, you'll feel better if you're able to like move even the smallest, smallest amount. And I knew I was better when I was finally able to stand. I wasn't able to stand upright because the back is quite flexible. The first time that I tried to stand up and be completely upright, I felt my back kind of go on me. I had had a laryscopic surgery which was the three points and although that's less invasive than having to be cut open, it is also three different points and then you know, you're going in and being quite small, being a dancer, they also had to put some gas in there to enlarge it. So all this stuff, my poor body had gone through. Oh. I basically just stayed in bed and got up a little bit, you know, to be allowed to shower, to go to the bathroom and stuff. So I was walking a little bit within our apartment and my fiance was taking care of me. Then I had to go back. I had to do the blood test and get the wounds checked a few days later. When I was at the hospital again, it was around lunchtime and I had been quite consistent with my meals and they took the blood, they checked my wounds. I was with my surgeon and I started to feel super lightheaded and I had not felt like that since I was like a preteen back forever ago and I had a need breakfast that day and I nearly passed out like the lights closed on me and that was the only time I had ever happened before in my life but I recognized it straight away and I was like, oh my god, I'm going to pass out. So I had to ask the surgeon if he had anything sugary and if I could have some water and luckily they did. They had some gummies so I ate the gummies, I felt instantly better but yeah, just take really good care of yourself and if you got to bring snacks. So the first week post surgery, I did basically absolutely nothing. I did just walking around in my apartment or walking to the doctors appointment and that was it. After the Chinese New Year actually, I started doing yoga that morning. Very, very, very simple and I did that every single day just to get a little bit of moving, just a little bit of twisting and to get some belly breathing. I also went out for walks because they say that after a appendicitis surgery, it's good to walk because that's a safe form of exercise and walking is actually very good form of exercise anyway. So I did that for two and a half weeks, almost three weeks and then I actually decided I felt good and I wanted to go on my bike very lightly, nothing fast, nothing crazy, no going up and down hills. That was also the week coming up on three weeks post surgery that I started finally doing some physiotherapy. Okay, I believe that's everything. So I'm going to let you catch up now on everything I've been doing. I'm so happy looking. I just got back from my general doctor appointment where I got some physical therapy written off through insurance, some extra physical therapy because the theater offers us so much. Fortunately, our budget has been cut and so that's one place where they're asking dancers to cut back. So I need to be able to do like twice a week or so to see acupuncture and to see a holistic kind of physical therapy, which has been so great. And even the difference between just a couple of days, between sessions has been so good. And tomorrow I'm going to go see the acupuncturist, but it's all just super, super gentle with a focus on like getting my organs healthy and running efficiently because that affects the whole body. And I'm really into that whole idea. I like Western and Eastern medicine together. Actually the guy that I am seeing for this physical therapy and who's kind of guiding me through it, he was a principal dancer here for a long time at the ballet. So I know that he knows what he's talking about. He has a lot of experience himself. So that's nice to be in good hands. I actually saw my surgeon yesterday also because I had to talk to him about some more testing that he wants me to do. I also spoke to him about extending my work leave because the amount of time was really for somebody who's going to go and sit at a desk, not a ballet dancer because I had read in one place that six to eight weeks recovery time is probably best for like heavy lifting and like difficult athletic work. But I mean you see so many different opinions, but that's why I really wanted to start vlogging. Even if this video is not like super helpful for a lot of people, maybe it's helpful for a few because I felt very lost. Anyway, I also spoke to both of them about how I'm feeling a little bit of discomfort. And it's not the same sort of sharp pain, but it's like a dull achy kind of in the bladder. Not a lot, but it happened a couple of times last week. That's one suggestion I have for anybody who's going through something similar or maybe not even so similar, but to write down how you feel like your symptoms and how things are going because it's so easy to forget. And I think it's good, especially in this situation where I clearly had some trouble understanding and they had misdiagnosed me basically. I think I want to be extra careful and like really know what I'm seeing and what I'm feeling and experiencing. And my general doctor said about this discomfort after doing more tests because she really wanted to be sure she took my blood again. She didn't ultrasound on me. She didn't see anything. There was no inflammation. So she said to me that it's very possible that it's scar tissue, but she said that very hesitantly and she said it saying that, you know, if this kind of thing worsens though, I have to tell her because she wants me to then go and get a scan at the hospital, which I really appreciate that she's working with me to make sure that whatever my pain threshold is that I get the right treatment for now on. Okay, that's it for now. Bye. Update, I've done some more tests following the recommendation of my surgeon and there's nothing glaringly wrong, but we're still waiting to hear back the official results. But it's still good news that there's nothing clearly wrong. I am increasing some movement. I'm hoping that maybe I can get some clearance to start maybe doing some Pilates and gerotonics and maybe some easy bar next week, but we're going to have to see what they think today. The people that I'm working with, they feel like things are going well and like flowing and like every week is making a pretty big difference. So this is good news. Hopefully we're coming to a little bit of an end with me being stuck at home. I would quite like to be a little more active soon. And this isn't just like the guilt talking because yes, I do have that, but I feel like I'm mature enough that I can compartmentalize that it's not like overwhelming my life. But I just miss like, I miss dancing. I miss dancing. I just miss dancing. Also I miss seeing my friends. Because as much as I am an introvert, like I need to see a couple of people sometimes, you know? Okay, I'm done talking to the camera. Bye. Okay, with log style, we're more casual now. Today is my first day to go and do some training. And by training, I mean, it's going to be very simple gyrotonics. And why gyrotonics? Because you're able to distribute the weight. With distributing the weight, you're able to focus a little bit more on what group, muscle group or area of the body you want to be working on. I might also talk a little bit about leg stability with my guy who helps us at the ballet. So I'm very lucky also to have to pay for this. And yeah, that's what I'll be doing today. Also an update that I am still as of yesterday, feeling that bladder aching again. Like I mentioned, I had started feeling that around three weeks post surgery. And it's dull. Actually, I'd say it's probably less pain than before. At this point, I'm not going to contact my doctor about it, but I'm actually supposed to see her next week anyway, because I need to get more physiotherapy credits through the insurance. So I'll be seeing her next week. Today, first, I'll be seeing physiotherapy. And then I'll go see the Pilates Gyrotonics guy. And we'll do a little bit of movement. Really, the focus for me is not on getting back into shape. It's on quality of movement and building blocks and having my body be healthy and not trying to go faster than I should. So with this in mind, let's do it. Final update is things are pretty good. I mean, I'm not 100%, but I feel like myself 95% of the day, I'm not even thinking about this. This final test has turned out to be pretty much fine. I just still have a little inflammation going on in organs nearby, which isn't surprising. Although this test was actually taken like three weeks ago, I did have a little bit of a drama trying to get this info. Oh well. Sorry for my makeup is a little wacky, but I did take class today. I've been doing some bar, just really simple, keeping my legs below 90, except to stretch. I can stretch to the front and to the side, but not to the back really. But I'm just keeping everything at 90. I'm also avoiding like really fast tendus because with tendus, when they're really fast, there's a lot of clenching and I don't want to be doing that. Opposition is really, really hard, so I'm not there yet to do center like that, which is good. That's fine with me. And I've been working on Pilates and yoga and gyrotonics is very, very helpful. I just actually filmed this video of one of my sessions yesterday. And it's helping to give me confidence and also more range of movement and to feel confident within that movement. I'm very lucky all of this happened when it did because not really missing out on anything. I don't really have to rush back either. I don't think it's a good idea. When I Google stuff, there's such a wide range of what they suggest. But you hear about like runners trying to do marathons. I heard of an ice hockey player who just three days after his surgery. I mean, supposedly he planned it with his doctor, but I mean mine was definitely not planned and it was quite complicated. But even so, he said, yeah, the doctor just said it was really going to hurt and it really, really did. And if an ice hockey player says that, I'm sure it did really, really hurt. But he said that he was fine. I don't know if I really believe that. I think we should be taking care of our bodies, especially as athletes. And I think we should be holding ourselves to higher standards personally. I don't know what he was playing, but if it was like for the Stanley Cup or something, I'd get it. But yeah, I'm just really grateful that like I don't feel the pressure to rush back. I did speak to some ex colleagues of mine who also had appendicitis and they also had bladder swelling. So they had a really similar experience as me. And one of them I know she took like nine weeks to come back to work, but she said it coordinated with their summer holiday. Kind of just talking to her about it made me feel a little better. If you made a today on this video, good for you and wow, you must be very interested. But I know that maybe it was a bit long, it was a bit rambly, but I just really wanted to give out some specific information to just like the few people who could really use it. It's okay if this is too long, I don't blame anybody. But hey, if you are all the way here, maybe you want to subscribe and please like the video. I do vlogs, I do ballet, I do DIY, and I do recipes and I have a couple of travel videos. Hopefully someday we can expand upon that. Future is looking bright. See you next time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6a8DPWMl-U,Andre," Good morning everyone. Today what I thought I was going to do is film a what eat in a day, but I am on my period right now and having like not had periods for a long time and struggling with anorexia, dealing with that has been quite hard because I've had so many like cravings come up that I just haven't ever had before. Craving foods that my eating disorder told me for so long like I couldn't have or bad fuel weren't healthy and suddenly like knowing that I really fancy those foods was quite hard but this time around I'm doing really well with it. I'm doing very well with actually honoring what I want to eat and accepting that like okay I might be fancying things that like society says is like not healthy but it's healthy for me to eat that because I'm going against my eating disorder and also just because I'm giving my body what it wants and like as I always say a healthy relationship food is much healthier than a restrictive diet so you see so today is going to be a what eat in a day on my period honoring my cravings in a rectory recovery. I was also working around the three things I've got to do today which is go to college walk my dog with my friend and go to my boyfriend for the evening for dinner. Also one of my period I do get really bad body image which does come upon past with anorexia but especially when I'm on my period I just feel awful about my body so eating is then kind of even harder. Today I'm going to be overriding all of that eating what the hell I want I bring you along just to show you that actually you are allowed to eat what you want you're allowed to on your cravings. Let's go get breakfast. Full breakfast I have my mini chocolate wheat books and cup of tea and then after this I'll get something else because I know this one will fill me up. I feel like sometimes your lips are just fancy chocolate in the morning I'm definitely more of a sweet breakfast person. I pick sweet over savory any day. So I always have a part two of breakfast. Today I'm going to have a crumpet or I have a crumpet of spread and jam actually that sounds good. I love crumpets in the morning. I'm done and I think I'm full so I will see you at snack which will probably be early because I have college today. I'm going to put a welcome on my meals around it. It's hard to understand my health obviously. It's just food. Doesn't matter when you eat it it's all what you do and you have it regularly enough actually. I'm hungry again. It's only like and I run a hot off later but I do have to go to college in a minute anyway so I was going to get my snack. I just wanted to talk about the fact that like I like throughout my recovery I've really beat myself up for feeling hunger and my eating disorder has kind of told me that like me feeling hungry or me fancying things is me being greedy and like if you're in the same boat I just want to tell you that literally it is not greedy or gluttonous or you're going out of control or any of those things to want to eat food or to be hungry or to want specific things whether society says that like healthy or not it's not you being bad or greedy or wherever society is like drilled into us. Your body needs fuel and your body knows what it wants and if you fancy something then you are allowed to have it basically yeah I'm going to get some yogurt and some granola because my mum has made some granola and I have some vanilla yogurt in the fridge and my soot. I'm actually losing my mind my throat is sore so I'm going to go and eat yogurt because I think it will save my throat. You can see my lap desk that I've been working at on my bed. I mean I didn't finish work because I'm so studious. Let's go get a snack. I don't know what the hell I was just doing. I just walked around for like five minutes of the spoon of my mouth wondering where my spoon was. Right. Oh god I just sat on these foot. Sorry, it's the apple. I'm alone right now just munching my snack. I've got it with my own accord which if you've been following for a while you know I didn't ever really use to manage to do that. So I've actually got a lot better recently just being independent and being like you know what this is my recovery I've got to do for myself not relying on everyone 24-7. So that's great. I'm going to go get a granola. Such a solid snack and my mum makes incredible granola. I'll try to leave the recipe in the description if I can. Look at the size of that. How I should miss my mouth. Why did I try and put it in my mouth was shut. I think I'm getting a cold. My throat's kind of sore. It's croaky. I hate colds. I like an undirected level of annoying. Like what's the purpose of them really? Like what is the purpose? Like why? They're just irritating. Finished. That was really good. Now I've got to go to college and then come back in between to eat lunch and then go back to college and then I meet my friend for a walk and I go to my boyfriend's for dinner. So it's a busy day but that was very nice and I guess I'll see you at lunch. I just got back from college and I'm going to get lunch which is a bit early but I'm going back to college at half 12 for another lesson. So I do need to get it early and like I said earlier like timing does not matter. I used to focus so much on everything happened to be like at the exact time but honestly if you're eating when you're hungry or you're eating enough around what you're doing in the day then it does not matter. There's no rules to when you should or shouldn't eat. You can't eat too late and you can't eat too early. Like if you're hungry and you're eating then it's the right thing to do. I'm going to have some vegetarian moga tawny soup. I think I'm like butchered that as a name. Mum made like a big batch of it and then we like stuck in the fridge. So I'm just going to have some of that. She's going to microwave it. It's like it's kind of like curry soup. It's like loads of rice in it. It's really good. This won't be all I have obviously because that's not enough for lunch but um. I'm also weirdly craving less chocolate today which is interesting. I'm just rolling with it. I'll just eat what my body wants me to eat if I crave chocolate. I'll eat chocolate. I bet I'll crave chocolate tonight but yeah. This soup is really good. I'm very awesome and warm. That was really good. I just cannot figure out what the heck I want is a part two or you know the rest of my lunch. I need to get in there. What do I want? So fancy banana. Something else. Something sweet. Oh I'll show you what I found. Yeah. Oh yeah. What are these ones? Oh hey these or not? And the mint mariglanz. The mint mariglanz are literally incredible. You would not think they would be good but they taste like mint chocolate ice cream and a biscuit. Oh thank you mum. Mmm. Banana. It's really nice that I'm at a point where I'm just like food is food and I just need it when I need it. I'm just going to eat it. There's no question in my mind now like what do I fancy. It's lunchtime. What do I go for? The mint ones or the hazelnut ones? One of each. Mix it up. They're just weirdly really good. I genuinely don't get why. You're wrong. A little cream bits in them as well which probably isn't natural. There shouldn't work but they do. Oh yeah. Now I'm eating the chocolate everywhere. I'm so really happy. It's crazy chocolate. If you're craving something right now and you have it available this is your sign to eat it because cravings are not bad then. Crabings are very natural. Everyone gets cravings and you deserve to eat things that make you happy with it fancy and hazelnut ones as well. Mmm. It's weird. I thought I'd get like a nutella vibe from it but I'm not. Now I'll go to upper furtherment ones. Are you having any more? Or slap it my way. I don't know. I think I might still be slightly hungry. I have another biscuit. Also, so I can't really talk to this channel about like fact that it can be hard when you're in recovery to get your period back. Not hard to actually get it back but hard mentally knowing you've got it back. I know I really struggled with that because I was like oh no that means I'm healthy now. My brain obviously took me being healthy as like oh I must be fat and then because of my eating disorder I had like awful connotations of that so then I just felt really guilty and bad that I got it back but I think the way I got over that is like to realise that I want to have my period because I want my body to function and having my period means that it is doing what it needs to do in that sense and also means I can have children which is what I'd always wanted and I know that's not a motivation for everyone because not everyone does want kids. Oh my hoodie strings been like top right at the whole time but yeah just remember that actually it doesn't mean anything about your worth or your weight it just means that your body's doing what it needs to do. I'm still kind of hungry. Are you feeling biscuits? Yeah I might have another biscuit. You go for that one. Who cares about serving sizes? Not me. I think I'm good now. I will see you after new snack which I think might be in a cafe but we'll see because the weather's awful. I genuinely am scared for my camera's life right now. I don't want it to fall off. I am at boyfriend's house. I'm just having a little snack because I'm really really really hungry. Oh these two loops are already open. Do I have to be okay? I was really craving crisps. They're very much open and they soft. That's fine. I don't know if this is a bad idea. I already need salt. They're a bit soft. That filled a hole. I might still be hungry so I'm going to eat an apple. I will actually see you again. For dinner I have a burger. What is it? Southern fried chicken burger. A Southern fried chicken burger but a vegan one obviously and there's some chips and then salad. How did I just forget what salad was called? Whoo! A little challenge moment. Look at the size of the bun. That's a massive bun. All good, all good and the hood. I'm just going to go in there. It's not like I haven't eaten a burger before. I'm real hungry. After I've had a very productive day. That's actually really good. This is really good. I think it's so really good. Wow. I'm going to finish this and then I'll see you in a bit. Finished. Whoo! It's all good. It's just normal. It's just very normal. Eating a burger. Thank you. I will see you. That's snack. Good evening. It is evening snack time and I am craving chocolate. I'm going to be honest that I'm craving chocolate. Can you supply me with some chocolate? What do I want? I don't know. Happy mint arrow. Snack draw. This is the snack draw. Okay. This is little recovery snack draw This is the options. Oh, Oreos. Milky way. Snickers. Crunchy. Why do I just really talk to a double decker? I'm going to have a double decker. It's bad, bitch. I'm a fat. It's been actually a really good day. Actually, I've eaten very well. I've actually wanted my cravings a lot today. I've wanted more I've eaten more and now I have a double decker because chocolate is not bad. Chocolate is actually really good. Chocolate gives you serotonin, no? I do look like a bit of a state, but it's like 9pm. Why am I not doing my fingers? It's so early, man. I'm gonna put my body that fuel. They're so chewy. They're nice, though. I've went a long time about a double decker. It's a very tragic time in my life. I'm going to have a restricted decker take. Let's get some chocolate. They're so chewy. That was like perfect for like chocolate craving, though. What's that you feel different from those other chocolate? It's like chocolate new gar. New gar? Yeah. New gage? It's new gar. It's new gar. It's new. It's new. It's not new. It's not too early. I swear, but it's still new gar. Not hot nor. Nugget. Nugget. It's not Nugget, is it? It's new gar. Look at that. It's new gar. It's not gonna be new gar. Is it? I don't know if it isn't real. There it is. It's interesting. It would be new gar. There you go. Anyways, I'm gonna end the video here. I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope you have taken something from it and it's helped you realise that you are very much out on your cravings. Anyway, whatever you want, I've had a very good day. I've done very well. I am doing very well. I'm very happy at the minute. Have a very good time. Please like and subscribe if you haven't yet. And I will see you all soon.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orQhpZzREjE,Andre," Hi! Guess who's back! So, I've been away from filming for maybe like the past month because I was so busy with uni. Right now we're having a breeding week which means I don't have uni. Well, I don't have to go to uni. And I'm at home and honestly all I'm craving is to do something creative, to stop thinking, stop using my brain and just like decorate my house, make art and so around myself with pretty things. Somebody is not feeling well today. Somebody is going to the vet today. Leo has injured his papa. I don't know how, so we're going to go to the vet later. I also have to decorate the rest, finish decorating the rest of our house. I don't know what to put in this area here. If anybody would like to suggest something to me, I would love that because I thought we were going to get some chairs. I was thinking to get two sort of leather chairs here, but it would just be decorative and it would not be functional and I want it to be functional. What I'm really supposed to be doing is finishing my essay. But I don't want to, I promise myself I would finish it today but I just, I can't, I want to not do this. Good morning. I'm getting ready to take my husband to get his first tattoo ever. I can't believe he finally decided to get a tattoo. I'm going to talk about something real quick before I head out. I have this kind of new perspective on anxiety, especially the social anxiety. When I started this series, I talked about the fear of being perceived, which was a term that I heard for the first time on TikTok actually. I relate to that a lot because when you have social anxiety, your anxiety becomes, comes from perception, from being seen, heard from others. What I recently realized is that there's even deeper layer to that onion, not fear of being perceived. Yes, there is a fear of perception, but behind fear there is shame. There is an incredible amount of shame that personally I carry just for existing. But I think something very common, if you've experienced childhood trauma, I think especially if you were neglected as a child, you're going to have some shame regarding your existence. I found working on this particular aspect of anxiety much easier than facing fear because it's easier to face your fear when you know what you're afraid of. It seems to have helped me really make a big bound ahead towards my healing. Especially because if you feel shame, you're going to feel other associated emotions that come with it, like for example, you don't have to feel like you deserve to be loved and praised and respected and so on. I think it's an important aspect to address. When I think of someone who carries shame, I immediately imagine someone who would have a posture which would have perhaps huts forward shoulders, someone who finds it difficult to maintain eye contact, someone who feels incredibly unsafe in the eyes of others, someone who may not put their own priorities and comfort ahead of others, like a people pleaser, someone who found it difficult to express their wants and likes, someone who's not in touch with their authenticity and who's not perhaps not even aware of what they like because they've spent their whole life adapting to others in order to feel safe, they're only able to live in the eyes of others. They're not able to connect with who they are, they can only be what the person in front of them wants them to be. So you have no taste, you have no opinion, you have no backbone, you're just whatever that person wants you to be because that's the only way you felt safe in the world. And it took me a long time to create boundaries, to figure out what are my likes, what is my comfort. It's still to this day, takes effort for me to, when someone is being toxic towards me, to not jump into a dessert that I probably did something wrong, yeah, to not like go into self-blame and take it as confirmation of my shame and of my negative self-talk. And someone is toxic around me that it just means that that person is toxic because there is absolutely no place in the world for someone being mean towards you, for someone being rude towards you, for someone disrespecting you, for someone making you feel uncomfortable, like those are all red flags for someone that you shouldn't be around. Or I thought, yeah, if someone is bringing negative feelings in me, that means I need to adapt more to that person. And I would stick around and do as much as I can to make that person like me and happy so that I feel safe rather than thinking that's not right, goodbye, which is what I would do now. It sounds so basic because you learn this stuff when you're a child at school, when you learn to socialise, but if you were abused as a child, you did not learn these things because your priority was not to learn to socialise, to be creative, to find your authentic self, your priority was just to survive, that was it, there was nothing else. And here we are now at 38 learning things that most people already know for decades. Yeah, today's bit. I think I'm going to wear this to you, kind of cute. Sometimes you kind of get hit with a bit of grief about the fact that you have to work hard at healing, while other people don't even have to think about hearing, while other people live their lives and do all the things that you're trying so hard to become normal at. This is what we're working with. Looks a bit messy. Is this cute? Do you think so, no? Are you doing to me? Are you doing to me? Yes, I like it. Very nice. Do you like what I did with my Gucci? Oh yes, nice. Yes, nice. It matches my shoes. Oh yes. Where you going? Come back. Where you going?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAEqhEmpkwE,Andre," When we talk about stress, we often think that it's caused by big life-changing events, but stress can also be caused by a buildup of small pressures in life. Waking up to a pile of dirty dishes the afternoon, seeing the junk mills slowly accumulate by the front door, always running out of printer ink and paper when we're in a time crunch to get something done. I know I might sound silly to stress over these seemingly meaningless situations, especially with everything that's going on in the world right now. But these non-stop strains of everyday life can add up. Until one day, it'll sneak up on us, and we won't be able to ignore it anymore. I've come to terms with the fact that some days will be more difficult than others, but that also doesn't mean that we need to give up, and just wait around until we start to feel the stress, take a toll on our emotional and physical well-being. I found that there are habits and systems that we can put into place to minimize these small stresses in life, because we all know that we don't need to add more things to our list of things to worry about. My first suggestion is to find a way to balance your day. Like everything in life, we need harmony, and this applies to how we spend our days as well. I noticed that I used to dedicate 80% of my time to work, and 20% for my personal life. No wonder I was always feeling burnt out. I had to find a way to rearrange my day to work less hours without feeling guilty or feeling like I was falling behind. I don't know if you guys can relate, but I noticed that I made up a lot of these arbitrary rules in my head. I mean, no one was telling me to work overtime or to reply to their emails as soon as possible, but it was out of habit, and over time it left me prioritizing work over everything else. Now I try to schedule my days and my weeks to reflect how I actually want to spend my time, because how we spend our days is how we spend our lives. This means scheduling meetings, but also date nights, family dinners, self-care days too, because what goes on my calendar gets dead. Of course, this is much more difficult if you don't have full control over your own schedule, but the least that we can do is to look at our calendar and find a day, or even just one hour of our day, to schedule some time to have fun, relax, and detach from our responsibilities. My second suggestion is to find mindful practices that work for you. When I decided to incorporate more mindfulness into my routine, I eased my way into it with five minute guided meditations, daily walks, journaling prompts to guide my writing. Well, these are great methods to help us to be more present. Now I know that mindfulness doesn't have to be a specific activity. It can be as simple as taking a moment to be mindful of the small, everyday pleasures. Maybe for you it's gardening, turning off your phone when you're eating, cuddling with your dog on your couch, or just taking a small break to listen to the rain. Whatever helps you to connect with the present moment, do it, and do it often throughout your day. These pockets of mindful moments act as a reminder for me, not to worry about the future, or to feel anxious about the past, but to pay attention to the life that's going on all around me. I am a perfectionist, not with everything I do, but I do have high standards for things I truly care about, and creating these YouTube videos is one of them. During the editing process, I find myself making endless little tweaks, going over the tiniest details that no one other than myself can probably notice in the final production. Making sure that the font is the right size, the skin tone is perfectly saturated, that the song transitions are seamless. While I don't think there's anything wrong with caring so much about what I produce, trying to live up to this unrealistic expectation week after week created an unnecessary stress to my life. It forced me to constantly look for mistakes, and I never felt quite satisfied. Having this mindset felt absolutely exhausting, and took the fun out of the creative process all together. I know it's just the perspective change, but now instead of looking for my flaws, I see my improvements and my growth. I even set a rule for myself that I will publish a video when it's 80% quote, perfect, and even if I make a mistake, it's okay because I can try again next week. One of the biggest reasons I get stressed is when I feel overwhelmed with everything I have to do. Too often I would feel anxious, procrastinate, and end up not doing anything at all. But I realized that a lot of this was due to not knowing how to properly manage my time, and not being able to get over the hurdle of just starting. This is why I find the five minute rule to be so effective, to get rid of the unnecessary everyday stress. I look at all the list of things I need to do, and decide which tasks need my uninterrupted attention, and which tasks I can tackle with the five minute rule. Five minutes doesn't sound intimidating, right? And I think that is why it's so effective. This is not about cramming more and more into our day, but it's a way to push through so that we have less things on our to-do list, and it takes a load off of her minds. So the next time you are feeling overwhelmed with your list of things to do, don't dwell on it. Just give yourself five minutes to start crossing off some things off of your list, and you'll be amazed at what you can do in such a short amount of time. Lately, when I find myself stressing over a situation, I started asking myself, is this something even within my control? That doesn't make the situation go away, but it has a powerful effect on easing my mind. The Stoics believe that we have very little to no control at all. We can't control what happens to us, what people say about us, other people's actions, the world and its problems, and if so, why are we more than willing to spend our time and our energy trying to solve it like it's our own problem? The more that I try to control everything around me, the more anxious I feel, and I don't want to go through life carrying this heavy feeling. Some try my best to accept that, some things will always be the way that they are, but what I can do is focus on what is in my control. I hope that you guys enjoyed today's video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT78DiGk8sk,Andre," In our free time, it's so easy to slip into doom scrolling, mindless browsing, binge-watching, or reaching for junk food. But what if we replace these habits with activities that genuinely make us feel good? I think in the busyness of life, we forget what really brings us joy and fall into habits that don't really serve us. This is where the dopamine menu comes in. A list of activities to lift us up during our downtime. The goal isn't to fill every moment with a task, but to help us avoid slipping back into those less fulfilling habits. By having an actual written list of our go-to activities, we can literally pick out what we need and make better choices. Jessica McCabe, the creator of this concept, explains it like this. It prevents us from going to the grocery store when we're hungry. So how do you create one? The menu has to be tailored to you. So the first thing is to make a list of all your favorite things. Then, like an actual menu, organize a list by starters, main course, dessert, or specials, depending on how much time and effort each activity takes. One only has three parts. I'll share with you my favorite go-to's and how it completely reshaped my daily routine. First starters. These are the small, quick activities that require minimal time and effort that can have a big impact on how you feel. Like making the bed, displaying fresh flowers, meditating, the list goes on. But I want to share with you my favorite three. I noticed that I tend to reach for my phone whenever I need a little break from whatever I'm doing. So I wanted to replace it with an activity that was a little more intentional. So when I have this urge, or should I say reflex, it's my cue to get up and make myself a herbal infusion instead. Instead of consuming more information, this is an actual break from my day, and I always feel refreshed afterwards. You know how they say to build good habits? We have to make it as easy as possible. Well, for me, it has made all the difference to leave my yoga mat laid out right next to my work desk. It's there as a reminder to do some light stretches and sometimes it even turns into a mini workout session. And afterwards, a little breathing exercise, taking just a few minutes to close my eyes and connect with my breath calms my nerves so much. Nothing resonates with us emotionally, quite like music. No matter what's going on in my life, no matter how hectic things get, listening to my favorite playlist can instantly winating my mood. I actually always have a pair of earbuds with me so that I can listen to it whenever I want to. I think it's because for that moment, I can tune everything out and reconnect with something that I love. Whether I'm in the car, cooking in the kitchen, or even in the shower, it works every time. And now we move on to the main course. The things that require more engagement, effort, and time, but also has a long lasting effect. First one for me is always to have a creative project. Our current creative project is to make all the art pieces for our home. It's rewarding to learn things along the way and also to display something that we made ourselves. I have a long list of things that I want to do next. Learn how to make throw cushions and even build small furniture pieces. Learning a slow skill is the best way to slow down and appreciate the gradual progress. Whether it's learning to play an instrument, baking from scratch, gardening or crocheting. For me right now, it is learning Portuguese. Of course, the best way is probably to go out there and interact with people, but the flashcards and games make it so much fun. And it's really easy to do when I have even just a couple of minutes to spare. Having healthy homemade snacks around is so crucial in my opinion, because obviously, this helps us make better food choices. I love looking up new recipes and making it is just as much as fun. I am obsessed with chia pudding right now and also these almond butter stuffed dates with the chocolate drizzle. It is so satisfying. The purpose of a sensory walk is to discover new sights and sounds. I love walking around the city in the late mornings or early afternoons because it's usually really peaceful. I also love bringing my camera along because it makes me pay attention to the things that I would usually overlook. Most of us have to be on our screens for a big chunk of the day, so going out, getting fresh air and discovering new things is the best way to reset our senses again. And then we have the specials, the activities that don't happen every day, but can make a big impact when they do. Maybe for you, it's going to see a play, a concert, volunteering or going out to a nice dinner. Two things that I've been loving lately. The first is a fashion show. Not going to see one, but having one. We get a dopamine hit from clicking that Buy Now button, which is why online shopping can be so addicting. But if I ever feel the urge to buy something, I'll go into my closet and just try on a whole of my clothes. I don't know if this is fun for anyone else, but I have a blast. It's also such a good way to appreciate what we have and create more outfit ideas. Okay, the aftermath is not so fun, but it's also a big motivator for not buying any more things. And of course on the list, my new favorite thing is exploring new parks in Lisbon. I love the parks here. They're so unique to the neighborhood, trees, the views, the energy is all so different. And we're starting at the parks closest to our home and working our way throughout the whole city. It always makes me think that we really don't need much at all to feel good. Sometimes just sitting quietly on the bench and watching life go by is all we need. I hope that this video inspired you to create your own menu. You'd be surprised how a few small changes in our day can make such a big difference. Thank you guys so much for watching and I'll talk to you very soon.",I tried the dopamine menu to reset my habits (game changer!),15.11.2024,Malama Life,woman,20s,8:01,10,"0,9997"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2WXiwg36P8,Andre," I'm doing the best I can. I really want to make it. I'm working for the whole day. I'm working for the whole day. So, my parents have a 12 years age gap. Been major differences in their personalities. I'm not going to go into detail, but let's just say it hasn't been easy. Mom is super into healthy stuff. I like to enjoy some unhealthy food from time to time. But he has a height of form. I��터 a lot of time. I love to eat food. Hey, glad you're here. I'm Chloe. This is the story of me finding love and trying to figure out what that really means. that really means. You're all my life that met some people, but somehow never worked out. To be really honest, I'm starting to wonder if I'm the problem and being the common denominator. I don't think I grew up having a good idea of what an ideal relationship or marriage should look like. And still not quite sure even to have a stay. I don't know. What is love? What on earth truly matters in happy relationship and marriage? And how do you know someone is the one? Ever since you're home from looking at your parents, I started developing this life goal. I need to find a partner whom truly compatible with I want to find someone who I can connect with emotionally, intellectually and spiritually on all levels, also having a cancer with. I want to be able to chat about anything. I want to be able to be myself and all in love with the way that I am in an relationship. And I want that for the other person to us. But how where is that person to see even exist? I don't believe there's such thing as soul-made. I don't think there's someone perfect for me on theory there. But I want to know how close I can really get. You know, I mean it's a decision of a lifetime, isn't it? However, as time goes by, I'm starting to feel the clock ticking louder and louder as my friends are getting married and having kids. And then there's me. I don't know what to say. I think as I get older, it just gets harder and harder. I remember the good old times when dating gets to be easy. But now I don't know what happened to me. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever be able to find someone. Perhaps it's really time to take it more seriously. But meeting people is honestly so time-consuming and tiring. We don't have that much time to spare. We need to approach it more effectively. We need strategy. I'm ready. My wings drives me crazy. Dressing up, fixing my strife. Always prepared. You never know who. Show some for a raccoon. Maybe it's that director. Oh, I can sing. I can dance. I can learn the smooth moves. I will do anything you ask me to. Jump out on the stage. Get locked up in the cage. I read your. Glitter and it's such a glamour. Why not impress me? Show me your ring. I hate you. So I've been reading this book. How to not buy a loan. Buy a logonery who is the head of relationship science at hinge in a Harvard behavioral scientist. I started reading this book because personally, for a really long time, I thought dating is quite difficult. I think it used to be pretty easy, but the older I got, the more difficult has become. And I do believe that dating is a skill that can really change your lives. This book gave me some perspective on what a meaningful relationship is and what it's like to have a more healthy approach to dating. So top five tips that I found very helpful. Tip number one is know yourself. Finding all your dating blind spots. A lot of us actually have this pattern that may be hindering us finding a partner. And Logan, I demify it three types of data. One is the romanticizer. Second is the maximizer. And third is the hesitated. And the romanticizer loves love. These are the type of people who believe that they're so made. And they believe that there's this one person out there for them. And they just need to go out and look for this person. And once they find this person, loving and dating would just be so easy and effortless. And so when their inner relationship and things don't work out, they tend to think that it's because they're not with the right person and they'll just end things and go off on the journey of finding again. And the cycle just repeats. And the second type is the maximizer. I think personally I fall into this category. I want to know what you guys are. Hopefully not in these. But I think I'm the maximizer. So the maximizer are the ones who try to optimize their options. And they have unreal expectations of their partner. This is a kind of person who is always thinking, can I just be with someone that's just 5% hotter, just 5% smarter. So they're always wondering what else is out there, rather than fully committing into a relationship and making things work. And third is the hesitator. This is type of person who has unrealistic expectations of themselves. They feel like they're never really ready for a relationship and they'll say that I'll be ready to date. When I lose 10 pounds or I'll be ready to date when I have a more impressive job. So instead of getting out there and learning about dating and learning more about themselves, they're always waiting for the day to come where they're fully ready. Share in the comments and let me know if you identify yourself within you at least. I think I'm the maximizer. And tip number two. Throw away your checklist and forget about ideal type. You know the song I'm looking for a guy in finance, trust fund, 65, blue eyes. I think it's really interesting how we often ask others what is your ideal type? I used to think about this so seriously, but now I've come to realize that it doesn't really matter and they probably don't exist. Logan suggests that we should throw away our checklist because after we go on a date, we tend to prioritize things that are more on the service, things that are easier to measure such as appearance, height, status, over long-term qualities that are deeper and more long-lasting. However, these are actually the key to a happy and fulfilled relationship. So what are the qualities that truly matter in a happy and meaningful relationship? Instead of looking for a guy and trust fund finance, look for someone who is emotionally stable, someone who is kind, someone who has a growth mindset, and someone who can communicate well and fight well. So these are actually the qualities that really help the couple building in a relationship, nurture the deeper connections that help you weather the ups and downs of lives. Tip number three, don't fall into the interview trap. So I like what we talked about earlier, we really go into a date with a list of boxes to check. I'm trying to figure out if this person is worth my time and if there will be a second date. I'm not going to lie, I was definitely like that. Constantly evaluating rather than just being in the moment. So the problem with that is when you treat like an evaluation, it's easy to miss out on the spontaneous and genuine interactions that foster real chemistry, and for you to really get to know this person on a more genuine level. So instead of treating like an interview where you're focusing on the checklist, try to be present in the moment. I think that would just help both of you to relax better and be yourself. Stop focusing on what they look on paper, focus on how you feel around them. Tip number four, take the experiment to approach and get out of your comfort zone. So instead of just getting dinner, why not try doing activity together? Why not go do a new place together? Now just go and have fun and see if you vibe. I think this is especially true for me because as I get older, I notice that my checklists tend to get longer and longer. But at the end of the day, I think I can still be really happy with someone even if they don't check all the boxes. And so nowadays when I approach dating, I think I'm definitely more open-minded to meet all different kinds of people. And yeah, just really challenge my assumptions about what brings me through happiness. And try to avoid getting fixated on the sparks or love at first sight. Instead, try to embrace this concept that's mentioned in the book called Slow Burn. So Slow Burn means someone may not be particularly turning upon your first meeting, but would make a great long-term partner. Tip number five, this might be my favorite. Don't let perfect be the enemy of great. We often see people living in very envious life who has everything but are not happy. And we also see people who don't have much living a simple life and very content with what they have. And it's going to be thinking like, what is it that separates them? And I think the answer is the mindset. It's how we feel about it, rather than what it really is. When we're choosing a partner, I think it's impossible to just feel completely happy and satisfied by the choice itself. But rather, it's how we feel about that decision. Because you're never going to know what it's like dating everyone else. It's not a real issue to be bothered with. You can either constantly wonder what's potentially out there, but in that case, there will be more difficulty for you to feel happy. Or you can learn to appreciate the love and support that your partner is giving you. The bond and connection that you share. Life or things in general don't come with inherently. We create and assign our own means to them, your actions, thoughts and values. In fact, it's usually the investment into building something, till it nights, the artwork, perseverance, the imperfection that makes something so beautiful and meaningful. And that's greatness. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. When people talk until what you wanna hear now, But they all disappear, they will let you down. So we better stick together, It's come whatever we're not coming home tonight. What is love? I think I finally come to understand love a little better. It's commitment. And in a way, it also means settling. Love is a decision. A decision to settle. A decision to stay. A decision to give. A decision to trust and embrace. It's made up by a series of small choices we make every day. Every morning we wake up and we choose this person again and again. Even if someone better comes along. Even when things get hard. Perhaps this is what real love is. A simple, yet solid feeling. And the answer was never out there to be looked for. The answer was always been here within me. I need only you and this crazy girl. We got along.",Why You're Struggling To Find Love: things I wish I knew earlier,30.10.2024,Chloe Shy,woman,20s,15:37,8,"0,9999"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzw-qZMYdqU,Andre," You don't really peeve me the freak off. Several things like slime and ASMR videos and other things that I'll go over with you. Give me the napkin. Is it still there? You still got it on. It's still there a little bit. Did I get it? No, there's still some. Yeah. All good? Yep. Perfect. Pet peeves. No matter how mundane, peeve you off. They just peeve you. I consider myself a go-at-the-flow kind of guy, but sometimes there's things. There's just a couple things that really peeve me off. I don't know if anybody else is with me on this because it seems to be a very popular thing. But one of the top things that gets my goat, slime. It's kind of razz- my eyes a little bit. When I was younger, I got a gift and because I am a boy, it's slime. You know, you get boys, gross bugs, bleh, make a bug from the thing, da-da-da-da-da-da-da. I fell into that category and so I was gifted slime one day and I played with it for like, I don't know, a little bit. And not even after a minute or two of playing with it, my hands were filled with like this weird texture. It was like an oily texture. Whatever else I was touching was also getting oily. And then the slime itself was attracting all kinds of hair and dust. It was disgusting. And it was like two minutes. I don't want to play anymore. And now I can't stand slime. When I see people make those satisfying slime videos, it just throws me into a deep, terrible rage. Anytime I see it, I just think of like sticky hair and oily texture. I don't know what's going on my brain that makes me mad, but when I see it, it makes me mad. I get angry. I don't like slime. And the threads. And more of a moon sand kind of guy anyway. Is it not just the better of the two? Would you rather play with soft, silky beach-like sand or icky, oily, gross, sticky, booger, snot toy? Something wrong with your kid. Anyway, moving on. I'm glad that we can all agree that I'm right. Next up is ASMR. I get it. There are some people that listen to it and they love it. The sound goes in into the brain and it gives it a little tickle and it makes them feel good. So for some reason, it feels the opposite for me. Oh! Stop it! You think it's like a personal space thing. ASMR makes it feel like somebody's right up in my bubble. And I don't like that. I like my personal space. I like me a good amount of air between me and people. Don't touch me. If I'm on a plane and your legs are touching my legs, I won't say anything because I'm pretty non-confrontational, but I'll be upset about it. Next up on the list, a pet peeve I think everybody can agree on. This video is sponsored by NordVPN. You know what you do at NordVPN is a virtual private network that keeps you safe online.

There's another thing that peeps me off that I'm tired of being quiet about and something needs to be said. One moment. Look at these two burgers. Observe how easy it is to eat this regular-sized normal burger. See? Relatively easy. Not dry this. It's messy. It's bigger than your mouth. It falls apart easily. Isn't it the worst? It's okay. I've been there, buddy. I don't like food that I physically have to crush with my hands to be able to eat it. I think there should be a law that prohibits burgers from being bigger than the average human mouth size, which is about 2.2 inches, which is around the width of three human fingers. Take your fingers out of your mouth. You'll be excited to eat a hot dog that required you to unhinge your mouth to eat? I don't think so. I think the rule of thumb is if your burger needs a stick to stay together, maybe it's time to go back to the drawing board. People who say short instead of average height, like people are tall or short, and somehow there's no room for average. What you're always hot or cold and there's no warm, faster, slow, full or hungry, day or night is your world so rigid that you are bound by the rule of black and white. Will you give no time for the brilliance of the sunsets of dance and the stage of the horizon? I'm 5'9 and that's short to you! It's average. Imagine what house you could build with hundreds of millions of dollars. Beautiful marble, gargist statues, water features, with that much money you should be able to make something really amazing with a lot of good taste. Well, I found a place that's somehow the opposite. I was on Zillow trying to find the most expensive place to live in New York. No, I am not procrastinating. It's important. Research. Anyway, I found this one. Look at how unfinished it looks. It looks bad. Can you guess how much this mansion costs? $125 million. Isn't that insane? You know, like wood at Home Depot that's like not finished or part of any complete project? That's what this place looks like. It's like a table where you got all the parts but never finished them. I'm not mad that the house looks bad. I'm mad that the house looks this bad with so much money behind it. How can you be so rich and make such a bad interior? It's offensive. Cough! Let's put this into perspective. Rich people can buy crazy things like F1 fighter jets and race tracks and probably a scrying orb. But then they go and get this. It just doesn't add up and it makes me pretty mad. Like if you're gonna have a bad house, it should at least be cheap. Or it's like spending millions of dollars on a party on the moon and then you bring out the dessert and it's yogurt. Just plain yogurt. Why ruin the million dollar party? With yogurt. I can only assume whoever owns this house just wanted to feel something. They've experienced so much opulent and extravagance that this disgusting violent interior is the only thing that's made them feel anything in years. Next up, the craft mac and cheese boxes. Bring it exhibit A. As you can see here, there is a nice perforated edge designed for the user to easily access the mac and cheese and cheese dust within. Perfect. It will make opening it so much easier. Except it doesn't. And every time I want a bowl of mac and I'm just crushing the box and I feel stupid. Okay, here I go. Perfect. It's so incredibly pointless. I'm having a hard time believing it's a real machine making these perforated edges. Probably just a guy at the end of the production line making indents in the boxes with his fingernails because he thinks it's like helpful or something. What is it? Even if it was. There's an entire bag of cheese dust in there that needs to be extracted. It's not gonna fit through that tiny hole. Just copy cereal boxes. They figured it out and you could do the same thing. Probably. No. There's this thing that gets my goat so bad when I'm on a walk with Ria and we're having a great time of taking in the nature. She's sniffing around. We come across a lawn that she's already been walking in with a tiny little usually green sign that says this lawn has been completely treated. Keep children at pets off until dry. Why is that sign so small? Tiny. Clearly the chemical that is treating the lawn is harmful to pets and children. Otherwise why would there be a sign? So when something is harmful, why is the sign so tiny? To still contradiction, it never, like why is it also green which blends into the grass? The issue arises when I don't notice it until Ria's already been in the lawn sniffing around. Clearly the solution is to have several signs, have a little skull and crossbones on it and then like string together some pink string between each sign surrounding the treating area. Imagine you had to store some nuclear waste from a nuclear power plant. But we need to keep this away from the public. It's harmful nuclear waste. So what should we do? I have just the plan. It's perfect. If I were to give you a vial of poison and say drink it, would you probably not. But then if I said, oh don't worry, it's only enough to kill small children and pets. Would you feel safe drinking it then? Probably not. Just hate those signs. Huh. I'm watching. And don't forget to subscribe. If you don't subscribe, it'll make me mad. You will like it when I'm mad.

Make this a 101 conversation between you and me or you maintain eye contact and focus the whole time. My name is Stefan Lathish or Stefan Lathish in English. I was born in Romania in 2006 and I moved to Canada in 2010 and I've been living here ever since. Let's get to it. Today I'm wearing the bathroom, I just showered some of my hair a little bit wet. Although my back's gonna get hot because it's on the way to the seat. I think you may have noticed that if you look through my older videos that like my face was pretty straight the whole time as in a technique this with my mouth was like kind of born. I didn't really have any facial expressions. Now I'm like mostly smiling with this. I can say from my experience, from like just being observant that when I walk around, when I just interact with people, now I'm just naturally smiling. I'm like, I'm just naturally smiling. I'm naturally happy. I naturally enjoy stuff again. And the biggest reason why I'm like that is because self-improvement, self-improvement basically saved my life honestly. It put me on this path that it made me love life again. It made me see all the possibilities of who I could become and I try my hardest in becoming the best version of myself. Knowing that, knowing that I'm trying to become the best version of myself, I walk around knowing that I'm trying hard and that just makes me much happier. It makes me see the bright side of things because I don't have anxiety thinking about, oh, I didn't do this, I didn't do that. I didn't try hard enough in my goals. Now I'm like, I know I did. I know I tried. I know that I'm better than I was a year ago. I know that I've improved my physical life, my appearance, my mentality, how I talk, how my charisma, my work ethic. I've improved so many aspects of my life. I really, there's so many things to be happy about that I'm just naturally happy now. And it shows a couple days ago, I got a text from a friend, this, I got a text from a friend, this girl that I know. And she says, hey, I notice you've been smiling a lot more recently and I think you have a really great smile. I was like, what the hell, thank you. Like, I was really appreciative of that. And in that moment, I thought, holy shit. Like, yeah, I have been smiling a lot more than I asked her. What about how I was a couple of months ago? Like right now I'm in first-year university. What about how I was in high school? Like grade 12 of high school? How was it? It says, oh, you always had this straight face. You always look so serious and sometimes mad. And I was thinking, yeah, what the fuck? Yeah, she's right. Because back then, I was just beginning my journey, like, relatively, I was like, just beginning my journey of improving myself. And so I was still kind of unhappy with my physique. I was unhappy with my mentality, my work ethic, how much progress I've made, all of that. I was really unhappy. And so just naturally, I walked around with this. Like about, like, I don't know, it was like some macho fucking, I don't know, stoic thing. But now it's, I've entered this like era of my life where I can enjoy stuff. I can enjoy it because I know that I've come so far. Even in this past year, I've made so much more progress in this past year than I ever have in my life. And that just makes me so happy, that just makes me so appreciative. Like, I'm gonna be honest, I'm not where I wanna be in life. 100% not like money, career, physique, all of that. I'm not where I wanna be. But the fact that I've gotten so far from where I started makes me so much happier. Like, my physique right now. Right, hold on. This is my physique. It's all right. It's all right at best. I'd give myself like my physique, like, six, maybe seven. Judging by like, or like, I guess relative to the people around me, I'd give myself a good like seven. And that's not where I wanna be. Like, eventually, even now, I'm trying to be bigger, all of that. But the fact that I've come so far, the fact that I've made so much progress and making me so happy, like, I'm no longer that shy little kid. I'm no longer that skinny guy. Just like, I should build up my arms, holy shit. Like, I'm not that big, but it still makes me so happy. Like, that still makes me so happy that I made so much progress. I'm so happy that I can read books and enjoy them. I'm so happy that I can watch podcasts, like a movie that just makes me so happy how far I've come. And this is like the beauty of self improvement. Once you become this like newer, better version of yourself, you'll start to realize what the fuck. The person who I was before wasn't all that great. The person I am now is exponentially better. And that I guarantee you, once you start to improve your life, ask anybody in your life that goes to the gym, when they were skinny or fat, or skinny fat, were they happier than how they are now? 100% guarantee they're gonna say, yes, I'm much happier now. Why? Because they look fucking great. Like, obviously I'm not that big, right? I'm not that big, but it's still a decent amount of muscle. Like, I'm not gonna be narcissistic, even statistical about it, but it's still really fucking great. Like, I'm proud of this, holy fuck. Like, holy shit, this makes me so happy just thinking about all the problems that I made about how much I've improved my life. And it's also makes me happy that like, so many people nowadays are also improving their lives. I'm like joining this community of self-improvement of people always trying to become better. It just makes me so happy. I'm trying to inspire my friends to do the same. I have inspired my friends to do the same some of them. And it just makes me so happy that they're on this path. And that in and of itself is such a great feeling. If I like, with that feeling, there's no way I'd be frowning. Like, knowing that I've been helping people, knowing that I was helped, knowing how far I've come. I have like a permanent smile on my face. It's just natural. And also like quick bonus smile, it just makes you more attractive. Come on, it does. Who, if you were a girl, who would you rather approach? Me, like this. Or me, like this. Like obviously, I'm not smiling like a lunatic, just, no, maybe I have my phone out and only like that. Or like I'm talking to a friend with some shit. I'm smiling. I'm not just straight faced. Who would you rather approach? Yeah, so smiling is so much more attractive. It just makes you so, it's put you in this like great state. It's like being in meditation. Meditation like calms you down to put you in this sort of like headspace of focusing on your birth and just like just focusing in general. Happiness is like similar. It's like a similar headspace when you're not, I guess meditating when you're not in this like focused in deep state, you're happy. You're in this like joyous yellow stage of your life. And that's, I think that's just so beautiful. Holy fuck. I'm just really great that our generation has come so far because I truly believe that Gen Z Gen Alpha, I truly believe that like we're gonna do like great fucking things. And that's just making me so happy. Like holy shit. I just ordered this book on like the history of humans. I sat here a couple minutes ago just looking at it. I didn't even read. I was just like doing this. I was just flipping through the pages. I was just appreciating it. I was just thinking the amount of effort someone put into this book. How many people have read this book? All of these things makes me so happy now. It makes me so happy to know that there are so many things available to me, to know that there are so many like, to know that life is so ripe with information with opportunities. If I haven't ever, if I didn't go on self improvement a year or two years ago, I wouldn't be like this. I wouldn't be so appreciative. I wouldn't be so happy. I wouldn't be so attractive. Not that I'm wow, so attractive, but I wouldn't be as attractive as I am now. And for that, I thank God. Basically, I can just look around my room and be happy because of all the things that I have. I bought this glass bottle from a store the other day. I'm telling you, this might sound like super autistic or some shit, but as I was buying it, I sat in my car and I was just looking at it and I was like, this had milk in it and I was just like, one of my water bottles, I have a collection of glass bottles. I was just looking at it and I was appreciating it. Someone actually like, milked the cow, delivered it to the store and I'm here buying it. And I milked like tasted better than ever. It tasted better than I would have if I just sat there and I didn't know that. Get what I mean. My monitor, it makes me so happy that there are monitors that makes work insanely easy compared to how it was 70 years ago. Computer, same thing. Books, holy fucking shit. Where would we be without books, without all this information? We'd be nowhere. Our race would be like done for it. Oh yeah, we're gonna pass information through stories. Okay, yes, people have done that through the years, through history, but who are the successful ones in history? Who are the successful empires? The ones with knowledge, the ones with books, one with written history. My bed, holy, I switched out my bed last year. I used to have like a twin bed. I think it was, now I have a queen and it makes me so happy because my twin bed, like kind of give me a back problem. It's like every time I woke up, I had back problems, all of that, my spine hurt, my back hurt. But now it's just like I'm thinking holy fuck. If I never switched it out, I would still have those problems. I'm so appreciative of this fucking bed. It just makes me so happy that I've come so far. It makes me so happy that I have all these things in my life that I can be grateful for. Never stop being thankful. I'm telling you, never stop being thankful, never stop learning. You'll become such a happy person. You'll become such an attractive person. I want you to take what I said in this video very seriously, as if you do apply what I talked about in this video about happiness, about gratitude, all of that. If you do apply it in your life and start to become more, more grateful of the things in your life, you'll start to become happier. And if your angle's to just become more attractive, then I guarantee you, like, you'll become much more attractive if you'll start to just appreciate things because that appreciative nature inside of you will make you happier. And happiness is a very attractive emotion. Thank you for watching this video.

Hi everyone, it's Keilani. You've never seen this side of me. Today, I'd like to talk about my long-standing struggle, which is chronic depression. I have been struggling with persistent depressive disorder for many many years. Persistent depressive disorder is also called dysthymia and it's a continuous long-term form of depression. You may lose interest in normal daily activities, feel hopeless, lack productivity, and have low self-esteem as well. These feelings last for years and may significantly interfere with your relationships, school work, and daily activities. Depression is not just feeling sad all the time; it's a serious medical illness. Sometimes I push myself to go out, but even when I'm having a good time with friends, there's always this low-hanging cloud over my head. That's how it feels like. There are so many things that I've done to get better, such as practicing CBT, healthy diet, mindfulness, and so on. When I lived in the States, I took an intensive yoga course. Ever since then, I've been practicing on my own. Those of you who have seen my lifestyle through my other videos may think that I have such a peaceful life, but that's not true. And I meditate whenever I can. Meditation helps me within the moment, especially when my mind travels back and forth between the past and the future. In order to stop feeling anxious, I practice positive affirmations. There are times when I can't function at all and have no energy to step outside the house. That's one of the reasons why I have many plants in my living room. I surround myself with greenery to give myself a sense of comfort. However, when major depression kicks in, I can't get out of bed. Can you imagine how it feels like? It feels like you're going through hell. When I'm in this condition, I can hardly take care of myself. Even though I love taking a long bath, when severe depression comes around, I can't even take a quick shower. I can say the same thing for cooking; when I'm in that condition, I can't cook. Before the pandemic, I visited Guam for vacation. If you see me like this, you probably cannot tell that I suffer from depression. Especially on social media, many of us only share the highlights of our lives, but you never really know how things are going in the lives of others. My parents and Jasmine have been my great support system, and I feel grateful for that. Especially my dad, he is always there for me to listen and empathize with my pain. Also, he always gives me credit for how far I've come. Spending time with Jasmine feels like I'm taking animal therapy. It's very comforting. Whenever I cry, she licks my tears and sits right next to me. I can see that she's aware of my condition. She literally heals my soul. I can't thank her enough. Good girl.",【Japan Vlog】Life with Persistent Depressive Disorder & Chronic Depression,04.04.2022,Keilani,woman,20s,06:40,9,

https://youtu.be/9dClhhVkCkc?si=BRWxjbCKF5OmEC7-,Marysia,I've always struggled with happiness not necessarily becoming happy I I can be happy even if it's not always real but maintaining my happiness I am coming at you guys crusty and Dusty as hell I don't know what's going on you guys I don't know if Mercury is like in retrograde but this week I just have not been in it to win it like at all I've been so just in my head having so much anxiety lately like just crippling anxiety to the point I feel like I can't even do anything and it's been so hard but today I actually finally decided to get up and do a little something I just feel like I need to like cleanse my energy I need to revamp my aura so I decided let me like clean the house let me shower do a nice shower routine like do a good skincare routine like let me read my book like let me do things that like bring back my energy that's the plan today because I can't live like this no more I can't live like this no more [Applause] [Music] thank you okay you guys I don't know how good this camera angle is but it's just gonna have to do because your girl is trying okay I'm sure like a lot of you guys are wondering like why didn't I post last a week um by the time you guys are seeing this you probably saw my community post on YouTube and honestly like I don't know what like I I feel so bad sometimes because I feel like sometimes like you guys are like dang this chick is in her little moods you know but like I've this year has been so moody for me I don't know what's going on I just been going through these periods where I'm like close to happy and then I get into these really deep periods where I'm feeling pretty sad depressed low-key and I don't know what's happening it's like I can't really shake this funk I'm trying to give myself grace these days though yeah it's just been really tough this is the biosons um squalene vitamin C super bomb please get it I actually went to a tarot card reader today which that's how you know I'm really going through some because I don't normally go to a tarot card reader unless I've noticed I only go if I'm really going through something and I just like don't know what to do anymore then I'm like dude freaking Give Me A Sign because I'm I'm literally a hair close to giving up and she had like a lot of good things to say and she made me feel better in a lot of ways but one of the things that she said that I was like no girl is that I'm gonna move to Florida the if any of you guys know I actually went to college in Florida I went to UCF honestly Florida's not for me like I am not a Florida girl Florida is just like it makes me depressed it gives me so much so much anxiety like anytime I have to go there to visit family I have some family there some family in New York I'm never excited when I buy the plane ticket like I'm excited to see my family don't get me wrong like anytime I go to Florida I'm like excited to see the family you know after like two days I'm like itching to get the out so when she said that I was like no mama I'm sorry I know you've probably been doing this for a long time but I am I'm just not moving there I'm sorry I'm just not going there but she did give me like a lot of like reassurance that like I'm gonna be okay and stuff and that that feels good I'm like okay so my life isn't completely over because sometimes as a content creator I guess because it's not like a job that comes with a lot of security there are moments where I am just like this this is it like it's it's the end for me it's I've had my time I had fun like and it's just over it's just is what it is I need to find a better balance with social media I have not had a very good balance with social media and it has definitely affected my mental health like I find myself comparing myself to other people a lot and picking at certain parts of myself and it's just like unhealthy thoughts pretty much that are just like not good I want to get back into my reading era I remember I used to be such a bookworm I used to read all these books I used to read every single night I remember I used to journal every night meditate every night and then read myself to sleep and that was the best routine I think I ever had like the mental health was on 10 freaking thousand oh [Music] got me feeling better one minute I'm in like a depressive episode and then the next day I'm just like I feel good I feel so much better today like last night honestly I just took the night to like cook a nice dinner for myself did skincare like read my book and fell asleep this morning I like woke up I did a meditation I took my time realizing that I need to start setting like better intentions in my life like I said before I feel like I used to have like a morning routine I used to have a night routine like I used to have intentions in my day and I think I've it's funny how when we get to like a good place in our life mentally and physically we stopped doing those those routines and those intentions that we placed for ourselves to get us to that mental high and that good place in our lives like that's what I feel like happened at me like I got to a really good place like mentally physically and then I stopped doing those things that helped me get there in the first place and now I I struggle with like some days feeling low and some days feeling good and it's because I don't have anything to really fill my cup anymore so I just set some intentions like I said I want to read more I want to get back into meditation I want to do things in my life that fill my cup in order for me to keep going because honestly that's the only way your girl can keep going because when I tell you I am a hair away from popping off like Kanye eye my hair away

then it also detoxifies and energizes skin from for revitalizing low sounds like it's going to bring my skin back to life and I'm super excited about it I can also use this overnight oh I love that I love a good overnight mask so I don't even have the urge to go out honestly I think I'm going to spend the rest of the day just like reading and meditating and relaxing I just want to stay home I have

https://youtu.be/la-xmYdtc7Q?si=rcSrAloi2R6_-v2M,Marysia,working on your mental health can feel a lot like trying to Pilot a boat through the ocean on a foggy day there's not a lot of sense of direction or sense of progression you're working really hard but you can't necessarily look around and see if you're getting anywhere or if you are getting anywhere are you heading in the right direction or are you just wandering about aimlessly it's a very lonely frustrating and demoralizing journey but if you keep at it and if you work hard and you keep going in some certain direction sometimes eventually you will start to see your destination off through the fog on the horizon it may still be a long ways away and you may not be sure if you're going to reach it or not but it at least starts to feel possible if not probable that you're actually getting somewhere and that someday this might actually work out okay unfortunately a lot of the time when you start to get closer to that destination out of nowhere a storm rolls in a dark storm windy rainy dangerous and you have to go below deck you have to just hide and stay safe you can't stay on the deck anymore you have to bide your time and let this storm blow over and sometimes the storm lasts a long time weeks months sometimes years when you finally come up when it's finally safe to get back on your boat or from low deck I don't know exactly how seab boats work and look around can't see your destination anymore you've been blown who knows how far off course by this storm whether this storm is a depressive episode a period of heightened anxiety trauma triggers a new physical health condition grief some other life stressor you've been blown off course and you once again have no idea where you're going or whether you're even pointing in the right direction for the purposes of the video let's say it was a depressive episode a depressive episode if it's severe enough can stop you from using nearly all of your resources it can take almost everything away from you as it drains your willpower drains your energy messes up your social functioning messes up your physical functioning all this stuff you work so hard to build up and build habits with and build consistency with can be taken from you and you have to start over again from scratch it's so overwhelming and you don't even know where to begin if you think of it if we go back to our boat on the ocean metaphor you were in this boat you were going the right way and now this storm has come and knocked you very very far off course right if you keep moving straight in other words if you keep going the direction you're going in you're going to miss your destination now and you're going to end up very very lost when an depressive episode hits it affects how we spend our time our sleep hygiene gets messed up we often are not physically active we stop spending time with people we stop taking care of our homes our bodies we don't go to work we don't go to school we stop doing all the things that keep us on course because we no longer feel able to what I see happen to people time and time again though is that when the episode itself passes and if you have major depressive disorder bipolar disorder or any cyclical mood disorder your depression then does come and go in episod that doesn't mean you feel completely fine when you're not in in a depressive episode but it means there's going to be ups and downs es and flows but when you're feeling better whatever that means for you you don't automatically get back on track you don't automatically revert to the lifestyle and the habits that you had before you often continue to live like a depressed person even though you are no longer in a depressive episode because the those are the habits and routines and momentum that were built up for you it's not your fault this just happens but that were built up for you during that depressive episode and so you continue to live like a depressed person even when you are not necessarily clinically depressed during this period of time the only way to get out of that and get back on track is to look at what changed during the episode what did this depressive episode take from you what did you stop doing and that may be a very very long list I know writing it all out can be very frustrating very ironically depressing right but I do think you should probably do it this is what I encourage people to do we covered this last week in intensive outpatient programming because this is where a lot of people are right now and here's what I had them do we all worked on making lists of everything that our most recent depressive episode took from us every single way in which we were knocked off course and these were lists of maybe you know 15 20 25 items many many things on this list sleep nutrition physical activity social functioning vacuuming dishes work school you know the list goes on playing guitar writing reading next I had them divide the items on their list into inputs and outputs inputs are the behaviors that give you more than they take from you and terms of things like time energy and attention in other words they more than pay you back for what you have to put into them outputs of course are the opposite your outputs are things that take more time energy and attention from you than they put back into your system but the outputs are usually things that are still really important for our lifestyle sustainability in general let me explain that a little more because this this is the centerpiece of this whole idea and I want to make absolutely sure that you guys get it it's very similar to a financial budget so most systems have inputs and outputs in a financial budget your inputs of course are your income so it's your paycheck and whatever other money you have coming in and your outputs are your expenses your bills and whatever else in any system that has inputs and outputs the ideal is to make sure that inputs exceed outputs or else the system is unsustainable and will eventually collapse your inputs in your mental health system some of them are going to be Universal and some of them are going to be specific to you so Universal inputs these are really pretty much going to be true for all people what includes things like sleep hygiene nutrition if you take psychiatric medication compliance with psychiatric medication um minimal or no substance use these are all not even really basic mental health tools but really basic brain health tools for all people and they certainly don't have to be perfect but if those things are not in at least a decent place it's very very hard for your brain to work correctly and it's very hard not to function at a deficit there are also things that are almost universally going to be outputs there's always an asterisk here because some everyone's brain is different and we perceive and react to things differently but for most people things like work and school are probably going to be outputs they're things that are important things we do need to do but they're not things we can just do indefinitely they're things that take a lot out of us and we have to recharge or replenish from them I think also for most people a lot of your chores your activities of daily living probably fall under the output category as well as probably hygiene for most people but that one I know can be an exception there are also a lot of variables on this list that are really going to be dramatically different from one person to the next in terms of which category they fall into so you have to really know yourself to do this activity correctly I'll give you a couple examples of that that so for me physical activity like exercise is 100% an input in fact it is one of the most important inputs that I have yes it does take a lot of energy and time to do but it pays me back throughout the day and ultimately it gives me more than it takes for me personally I recognize that that is not true for everybody and that many people find it to be really just a burden um and it does not function that way something I'm on the opposite side of is socializing I am a pretty introverted person and so being socially active takes more than it gives from me I cannot socialize indefinitely it puts a major drain on my system to do so even if I like and love the people I'm interacting with and I do have to have a recovery period from that for a really extroverted person social engagement is probably an input it is something that is really really giving to their system and helps them keep going it might be one of the most important resources for them to recover from a depressive episode for me it is not once you have determined what falls on the input list and what falls on the output list what I encourage people to do next is focus as much as possible exclusively on the input list we want to get as much coming back into your system as possible before we try to start taxing your system by putting expectations on you I know sometimes there are real world limitations to this in terms of things like your job or you know some of you are parents it can't always be perfectly all inputs first then work on the outputs but to the best of your ability I encourage people to focus almost exclusively on rebuilding those inputs work on getting back on track with the things that are going to recharge and replenish your system and make more resources available for you to do the things that fall in the output column far too often the things that are on the output list are often the things that other people see in our lives other people don't necessarily see how you're sleeping or how you're eating or whether you're taking your meds or not they do see whether you're going to work or not they do see whether you're going to school or not they do see whether you're showering or not or you know you get what I'm say saying um and so those are often the areas that other people really emphasize for us to get back on track with they tell us you you know you last time you were doing better you were doing all of these things so you should try to get back to doing all of these things to stay better what they don't realize and and I think this is usually a well-meaning But ultimately unhelpful perspective to take is you were doing those things because your system was working properly those things were not the cause of your improved mood they were the effect of your improved mood the cause of your improved mood was the inputs the behind the-scenes stuff that most people cannot observe in your life and what I see happen far too often is as soon as people have started to recover from a depressive episode or any type of setback they try to jump right back into their lifestyle at full speed they don't have all their inputs set back up yet and they start to reintroduce all of these RS on their system and they ultimately end up in an unsustainable pattern which hastens the onset of the next episode and keeps you stuck in this vicious cycle of episode after episode after episode because you never have a chance to fully rebuild from the last one I know I'm mixing metaphors and it's dangerous but it's like you your home gets destroyed by an earthquake or something like that right and the foundation is damaged and you work on the foundation a little bit but the foundation is still very cracked and very unsettled and you start building all the upper level stuff you start rebuilding the kitchen rebuilding the bathrooms etc etc but the foundation's not rebuilt yet and So eventually along comes another earthquake and since the foundation is still unstable the whole thing falls apart again and we just get caught rebuilding these upper levels over and over and over again either not realizing or just not having the luxury of working on the found you have to rebuild the foundation if you want the things you're going to stack on top of the foundation to be resilient to the es and flows in your mental health status and the general ups and downs and stressors in life that you will face so that was that was our focus last week I hope this little peek into the psychoeducation portion of my intensive outpatient program maybe has some applicability or at least some interest to you all as always please feel free to ask any comments that any questions that you might have in the comments I'll do my best to answer them and if the same question pops up for a lot of people I will make a follow-up video on that topic to explain it more thoroughly I always want to say too like I recognize that this is easier said than done I break this down into a very simple concept I know that actually executing the plan that I have laid out here is not as simple but knowing is half the battle and hopefully by having this information you've at least got that half covered good luck and take

,Josy,"So I just wanted to take a moment to reflect on how happy and nice my life is. So usually I feel like all of us in general, we can get down sometimes and not take enough time to reflect on our actual lives. So that's what I wanna do right now. I wanna reflect on my life and how grateful I should actually be. So overall, my life is amazing. I mean, if we're looking at the world in general, there's so many bad things going on. There's so much war, so much suffering, and I'm inflicted to none of these. I am able to wake up every single day and make breakfast, have food. I never have to worry about whether there's food on my table, which is already something we should be so grateful about. And I am like, there's so many children, not even just children, so many people in the world right now who are struggling to get food, and I'm not one of those people. Secondly, my friends and family. I am so grateful to have so many loving people around me. Also so grateful to still have so many people around me. I know a lot of people have had to deal with a lot of grief of family members dying. I'm so grateful with the fact that not only are all of my family members still alive, I mean, except my great grandparents, but my grandparents are still alive. My parents are still alive. Every every aunt and uncle is still alive. So I'm very grateful about that as well. And secondly, not only are they alive, but they support me in everything I do. Because at the end of the day, family is not blood. Family is someone who you choose. And I, even though my family is my blood, I would choose them over and over again because of how loving and amazing they just are. They constantly provide for me. They have everything I need. I can get to call them every time and just get their love and support. And I'm so happy about that, and I don't really realize that as much. I always forget that and view the negative sides of my life, which none of that matters. All of the negative things are usually things that can be solved within matter of minutes, hours, days, or weeks. And there's nothing actually threatening, to my life. Next is where I'm living. So Amsterdam is such a great environment. There's, I mean, everything has everything to offer. There's nothing I could want more. No city maybe except the weather, but, that's something again, a little thing, which actually does not mean much in terms of life and happiness. And I'm just so happy. And I realize this over and over again when I do actually take a moment to reflect because taking these times out of your day is so important to just sit down and think, well, actually, it doesn't matter that this and this person did this and this because who actually cares? What matters is that I have all the necessities. I have food, I have water, I have shelter. I have love from my parents and friends. So what else could I truly need? So I really think that general reflection is so important because it's just doing this, just taking, like, 2 seconds from my time and think about this. Getting up from bed, stopping the horrible mood, stopping this constant cycle of being on my phone and just scrolling and scrolling, which is doing nothing. It gives me a little bit of peace and knowledge that actually everything is okay. And especially saying out loud, recording it, it makes it more real rather than just thinking it because some thoughts can get so muddled up and you can constantly find yourself on a new, train of thought. And it's hard to sometimes stay on the same train of thought. But when you're talking out loud, it's a lot easier to continue the sentence to say, I love my life. I love my friends. I love my family. I love where I live. I love Amsterdam. I mean, what is there to not like in my life? There's I bet so many people out there who wish they could have a life like me. So, yeah, I think it's so important to do this. And, yeah, overall, I am very happy. I'm very grateful. I should be more grateful than I am. I should be doing more gratefulness activities. Sadly, I am not, but that is something hopefully that could change someday soon. So, yeah, overall, I think I'm doing okay. My studies are going well. My university course is great. I think, yeah, my life is moving the direction it should. Of course, there's always hills and bumps that might, like, seem harmful, but actually they're just leading us in the right way because going somewhere where you shouldn't, even if that at the time seems right, is also not good. So, yeah, I just wanna end with another. I'm so grateful for everything in my life.",,,,,,,,
,Josy,"So my life, how is it going? Well, at the moment, I'm actually extremely happy. There's so much to be grateful for. When I think about the past couple of weeks, I recall memories of always hanging out with my friends, doing exciting stuff on the weekend, and feeling so much happiness. It was just Halloween. Halloween was great. We went to multiple parties. Wong was at an amazing penthouse. It was so big and I went there and I've I've never seen something as big as that. I felt I felt like a giant. I felt I felt so happy being in such a place like Amsterdam where I may be able to experience all of these crazy things that I've never seen before. Then we had the proper Halloween party on Halloween where we went to a club. I may have went to Little Bit too overboard but it was still so much fun. I had I felt so much love from all of my friends and I was so happy to be there. Now this weekend, I have so many exciting plans this weekend. There's 2 clubs that I'm going to and I I can't wait to spend more time with my friends and hang out and do fun stuff. Amsterdam overall has been such a great experience. I can't even imagine doing something else than being here right now. I'm I'm so happy. If only there was more sunlight. The weather is sadly getting a bit gray, which is my mood at times but I'm still trying my best to keep up my spirits. To do this, I I try to eat healthy, do exercise, and maintain a healthy body. This truly lifts up my spirit because I know that when I'm not participating in these acts I get a little bit sad. Hence, I'm always happy. Of course there are times when I wish that something was better in my life but overall there's it couldn't be better. I'm so grateful. I'm a little bit sad that I'm not with my family all the time but then I have even more excitement in seeing them soon. In just a month, a little bit over a month, I'm going to be visiting my parents for Christmas, spending our lovely Christmas holiday together, eating amazing food, and just feeling happy and loved. Last Christmas, for example, we had such a great dinner. We had a, a goose with some red cabbage, some nice gravy, some potato. I'm not exactly sure how they're called in English, actually, but overall, such good food. I was with my whole family. Nothing makes me feel better than being with my family. And, of course, with my pets, I can't wait to see my 2 cats. My 2 cats bring me so much joy and happiness. It's it's the best feeling in the entire world. Overall, I'm so grateful for having my pets and I wish they were with me at the moment. However, that's one thing I can't wait for. I, in a couple of years, when I will be living by myself in a nice place, I can get some animals like a dog or a cat which again will bring me so much joy as they are doing at the moment. School is going great as well. We have such nice teammates. We have everyone's everyone's collaborating. Everyone's working together. We all share the same mindset. It's it's such it brings me so much peace to know that I can trust my teammates with everything and to know that they're always working on the things I want them to. So life overall is great. I'm just so happy with myself as well doing everything I am, keeping on top of work which is always good, making sure all my tasks are turned in on time. This also creates less stress myself which is important because stress makes me sad. But because I have no stress, I am allowed to feel happiness. This also lets me not have idle time because if I stress that I procrastinate, which makes a lot of idle time where I wish I was doing work, but I'm not because I'm not doing this and doing my work on time and I have so much time to spend relaxing as well, which allows for for balanced life. Because then when I'm going out and I'm doing my favorite activities, I know that I don't have to worry about not getting enough sleep because I've already done my work. So then I can sleep in and relax and get up and do my next activity because, overall, my life is so great, and I'm so so happy. Yeah.",,,,,,,,
,Josy,"Hi. So I just wanna reflect on my life a little bit, talk about my well-being, talk about how I'm doing. So of course there's goods and bads. I mean, I've been feeling a little bit lost in life. There's been some bumps at the moment. I do think a lot of that has to do with my hormones, which is just a scientifical fact. I mean, I'm not trying to say that. I'm just like this trying to blame it on anything because but while I was having my period I was feeling very down, very sad. I was crying for days at end which is not fun at all. Thankfully my period is over now so I'm not just crying, which is always good. Yeah. But I've been feeling quite stressed lately actually. I mean just the thought of masters blooming, thought of life continuing, thought of again, having to move on, move to a different country, which is just something I've been doing my entire life. I mean I feel like I've low key a bit of fear of abandonment issues as, especially living abroad my entire life. Most people don't stay in one country. Well my parents and me we did stay in a country for a very long time which meant however that I was the one who got left behind a lot of the time and my friends kept moving on which of course is not great either moving from country to country. And I guess I had more stability in that sense but at the same time I do did always then suffer with having to live lose friends over and over again having to find friends because of that. I feel like I find it quite easy to find friends, however, I find it quite difficult to make extremely strong bonds which I do realize all the time. There's only 2 people in my life who were in my life for 8 years. So there were also some people who stayed in the country for a very long time who we think I have extreme bonds with. Other than that, I do struggle a little bit. However, my life is not all down, of course. I am very happy with everything in my life. I have a great family. I have great friends, and I should be extremely happy. To make myself more happy, I should be increasing stuff like diet and exercise. But at the moment, I'm just always paralyzed with the stress of uni even though there's very little to do but just that little bit sometimes paralyzes me and then I can't do anything and I chill in bed which of course is never good. So I think that's something I definitely need to work on because stress is, I don't know, stress gets me a lot, but I do it to myself because I I tell myself, oh, I work better under pressure. I work better under stress. But is that really true? I'm not sure, to be honest, because it just makes me sad because then I'm so stressed that I can't hang out with my friends. And then I'm sad and I'm lonely because I'll just be in my home for days at the time trying to do my work and failing and then crying because I'm lonely and I'm sad and I'm not doing anything. My life feels stuck. And to do that, I should just do my work, but I have this paralyzing fear of procrastination, which is so horrible. But here I am doing my work for once, which is good.
So that makes me happy. The thing is, at the end of the day, like, it's so weird. I feel like humans, like, don't do what they should because if I just did my work not only would I not have the stress but I'd feel so great about myself which would make me happier and my well-being better. But because I'm not doing it I get more stressed and I get more sad. So just doing the work but for some reason sometimes I just really cannot and it's such a struggle and it's really painful actually. But, you know, doing one step at a time. The problem is just that we have we're in such a new generation of this this TikTok brain dead population that has no attention span and constantly needs to be doing something, which is really horrible, and it affects me too. I tried I tried deleting TikTok, but it's just my phone in general and just the Internet that there's so much to do. And the best thing would be to just put away our phone, put away the Internet, but it's not as easy as that because that's a way of communicating. That's a way of doing any work, any presence with friends and family. I mean, my family is abroad in so many different countries that I just could not even, like, couldn't communicate with them if I didn't have the Internet. So, of course, there's so many positives, but but the positives comes negative negatives. And I feel like people always try to, I don't know, wash over them and and say, oh, just don't talk about the negative stuff. Talk about the positive stuff. Your life is great. Yes. But we need to address the but to make it even better because if we ignore it, it doesn't get better. So, yeah, even though my life is great, I do feel very sad and lonely and stressed a lot of the time. And this is just me being honest about my well-being. So, yeah, thank you.",,,,,,,,
,Marysia," Hi so today I'm just gonna talk about my life and why I am so grateful for everything that I have because I realize that usually when I make those kind of videos, I just talk about how bad I feel and know about how you know how great my life actually is and how grateful I am for what I have. And so. You know, just thinking about my life now, like first thing obviously on my studies, because that's just what's on my mind the whole time. I'm a full time student. So yeah, I'm just. I'm also trying to be grateful because, you know, I made it to the second year, even though some of the assignments were actually. I'm challenging I'm I still managed and I'm I I'm really, really proud of myself that I just keep going and I, you know, I'm trying my best and I feel. Like I'm I'm really. I'm doing really, really good actually. So that's that's the first thing. I'm just. I'm just really happy that I I found something that I actually enjoyed doing. And you know, I'm just, I'm just happy to be here and yeah. And apart from that, you know, you know, life is is a big. Part of my life, obviously, and and I'm also like, I'm so happy and I'm so grateful for the all of the friendships that I that I did here. And you know, I couldn't even imagine when I moved to Amsterdam that I would be able to have such, like, amazing people around me. And I I am really, really grateful because of that. And it's it just it just makes me feel so proud of myself because it's sometimes it's just challenging. To make new friends and and somehow I managed and I feel that I succeeded honestly. So that just makes me really, really happy. And it's truly a wonderful, unique experience, so. Say and apart from that, obviously of UM, the other relationships that I have that I'm that I'm trying to like, you know, work with and I'm. And I'm also, I feel like I'm doing really, really well. I I managed to get like a lot of like pure connections in my life. You know, I live with my. Best friend from back home and it's. And it's also like it's been great, you know, being friends, being friends with someone for over five years now. It also made me realize, like, the the power of. The the friendship and how much it just gives you. And also my my friends from back home, even though we are so far away from each other, we were still in touch and we are we are always happy to talk to each other and we always you know support each other and we and we talk and we call and we are just yeah we are just really, really good friends. Even though it's it's, you know, we are so, so far away from each other. And and also my family. Obviously my family is, everyone is back home, but still I am. I'm so happy of like the relationships that I have with, you know, within my family with my parents and with my siblings, I just feel like it's it's so pure and it's so beautiful and it's so important. And. And it just makes me feel really happy that UM, you know we are. We are like this big family that just supports each other and UM and we we love to spend time together and we visit each other and it's and it's just it's been great. It's honestly been great. And yeah, and also, you know, my job here, I I feel like I met so many wonderful people and. All of the customers that I have are usually really nice to me and you know they they know my some of them know my name by now and they know some things about my life and it's. And it's also like it's it's so important to find something that you actually enjoy doing. And I and I accomplish that. And I'm I'm really, really proud of myself and happy that I that I managed.",,,,,,,,
,Marysia,"Hey, so today i am gonna talk about my day and i'm gonna, because i realized that, you know, whenever i have a really, really nice morning i i never do like those kind of videos like i i i realize that people only make them and i only make them when i'm sad and it's like, oh, you know, I woke up at like 3 p.m. and i've done nothing and it's just horrible and, and shit like that. And, you know, whenever i have a nice morning, I never think about, you know, making a nice video and just sharing with people like oh look like i had a really, really nice morning so i'm gonna get you through what i've done and what i've left to do. So basically, I woke up not even that early, like around 10 a.m. or something. 
and yeah this this video is not gonna be about, you know, the most productive, successful, beautiful day. It's just like the kind of morning where i'm happy and um and i feel like my my life is my life is great so yeah i woke up at 10 a.m. I spend a bit of time on my phone just like going for instagram and some other social media and just you know just spending chilling, just getting ready to start my day. And then I left the bed, I made the bed, which is really important. It really makes a big difference. For me right now, it's like a crucial part of my routine to make the bed. So I did that. And then I made myself some breakfast, some oatmeal with apple and cinnamon. 
And then I had a tea, a really nice green tea with mango and mint. And that was amazing. Yeah, and after that, I did my laundry that I've been trying to do for like the last couple of days, but I just, I didn't have time and I didn't have any motivation. So I did that today and I'm really proud of myself. Then I cleaned the bathroom. It was just like, you know, like a quick, touch up, I would say but um yeah now it's now it's clean so it's amazing. I had a shower, so that was great. You know, after cleaning the bathroom, really nice um way to start your day. Then I read a bit of my book um which is like, also a book about, you know, introducing new habits and like, 
you know, making your life easier and more efficient and, like, more, it makes you just more productive and, like, successful, I would say so yeah that was that was great and yeah then I watched, like, one episode of this show that I'm watching now. And, yeah, I still need to do the groceries. I I have a couple of things for me to finish, but it's fine, and I just wanted to share with you guys that I had a really, really nice morning, and, you know, I just feel like I need to make more of those videos where I actually express, like, my gratitude, and, you know, and it's not only complaining about, oh, I could have done this, I could have done that, because I could easily, like, switch the 
the situation and yeah, and I'm just trying to stay positive and grateful. And today I am quite successful doing that. So I just wanted to share it with you guys.

,Josy,"Yeah. When I was thinking about my well-being back in the old days, I actually think it's really positive. I had such a great, amazing and wonderful time. Um, when I was a child, I was jumping around on the playground with my friends, with my best friends. They were so friendly. They were so, I don't know, wonderful. And, uh, just, I don't know, exciting. It was just an exciting time to be alive. An exciting time to to run around, to explore new, wonderful, um, neighbourhoods in my town. We went to the woods, we, um, played football. Um, we won. We won a lot of games. Um, but, um, also we played other games which were really, really fun and exciting as well, Like basketball or just tag where my friends ran after me and they tried to argue.

And that's really amazing. And that's why I'm looking forward to the next years of my life.

,Wentao,"Hey guys, today we re gonna talk about the influence of journaling And Here is my Journal Its basically about something something bad moods, something something difficulties that has come in to my study, like my procrastination, uh, you know what is happening There are almost no differences with other journals, no beautiful illustrations or images, just quite a simple one. But, journaling has become an essential part of my daily life that keeps me balanced, my mind clear, and my spirit calm. It's amazing how this simple habit can make such a huge improvement, not only in the way I spend my day, but also in the way I feel mentally and emotionally First of all, journaling gives me a way to get myself organized. Sitting down to journal at the end of the day allows me to release my mind. Writing down thoughts, feelings, or any unresolved issues helps me make sense of them. It's like I'm clearing out mental clutter and allowing my brain to relax. Often, just by seeing my thoughts on paper, I can understand them better and even see solutions to problems I hadn't noticed before This habit has also been very beneficial to my mental health. When I feel stressed or anxious, writing helps me calm down, especially on chaotic or overwhelming days in Netherlands. It's a quiet moment where I can let go of everything bothering me and focus on how I'm feeling. This process of self-reflection is almost therapeutic. By gaining a deeper understanding of my thoughts and emotions, I feel more resilient and empowered to face whatever comes my way One of the surprising effects of journaling is that it encourages gratitude. Over time, I found myself naturally noticing the positives of each day, even if they were just little things like a beautiful sunset or a nice meeting with the girls. It helps me turn my attention to gratitude, which improves my overall mood and perspective. This daily gratitude is a powerful antidote to negative thoughts or emotions, creating a more balanced and positive outlook on life Finally, journaling strengthens my connection to myself. In our fast-paced world, it's easy to lose sight of our goals and values. But by journaling, I have a space to reconnect with the things that are important to me. I can track my personal growth, explore my thoughts on different experiences, and even make plans for the future. It's a constant reminder of who I am and who I want to be, giving me a clearer sense of direction In short, journaling keeps my daily life both organized and calm. It's a simple yet effective way to reflect, reset, and grow. With each journal entry, I feel more fulfilled, more grateful, and more resilient.",,,,,,,,
,Wentao,"So today I am gonna talk something about meditation Meditation has helped me stay in the present moment and has greatly improved my emotional well-being. In a world full of distractions, it is easy to get caught up in thinking about the past or the future, constantly reacting to things without a moment's pause. However, meditation has taught me the value of simply “being”. Through this practice, I have learned to focus on each present moment, observing my breath, my body and my surroundings without judgment. This focus allows me to move through each day with greater peace and concentration, letting go of unnecessary worries and experiencing life with a more open mind I also found a book titled A Practical Manual on Meditation, written by Massimo Scaligero, who is a master of Western esotericism and meditation tradition. I highly recommend this book! After reading this book, I realized that meditation is beneficial in developing a stable mental state and ultimately mediating negative emotions. I felt it was exactly what I needed. It is a crime that few people in need of improving well-being know this book Meditation has also become an important tool for self-reflection. The techniques I have learned, especially from the Buddhist tradition, encourage me to look inward and examine my thoughts and feelings with curiosity and compassion. Buddhist meditation usually involves observing a person's thoughts, noticing patterns, and understanding the root cause of the thoughts or feelings rather than trying to change them. This approach has given me a clearer understanding of who I am, my motivations, and how I react to different situations. Over time, I noticed a change in my relationship with myself: I was kinder, less critical, and more forgiving. This practice of self-compassion has helped me better understand my inner world and develop a healthier relationship with myself One of the most significant benefits has been the impact on my emotional well-being. Meditation provides a refuge, a space where I can release stress and regain inner peace. Buddhism focuses on positive thinking and letting go of attachment to fleeting thoughts or material issues. This philosophy helped me cultivate a state of acceptance and taught me to face challenges without being overwhelmed. Now, when I experience stress or anxiety, I can rely on this practice to calm my mind and allow me to face the ups and downs of life with greater balance and resilience In addition, meditation connects me to a deeper sense of spiritual well-being. The teachings that inspire me-especially Buddhist teachings-suggest that true peace lies in moving beyond surface thinking, beyond the chatter and agitation we often feel. Through meditation, I experience brief but powerful moments of calm and insight, moments that remind me that there is more to life than the daily grind. This perspective is priceless; it keeps me grounded and keeps me focused on what really matters Meditation has brought about countless positive changes in my life. It has taught me the art of being, encouraged self-compassion, and provided me with powerful tools to achieve spiritual peace. Inspired by ancient practices, meditation is more than just a routine for me; it is a way of understanding myself and the world around me, providing me with a path to a deeper level of consciousness, serenity and a fulfilling life So if I have a problem that I can't solve on my own, the first thing I do is use meditation to calm myself down",,,,,,,,
,Wentao,"Today we're talking about a brilliant trick for promoting emotional well-being: spending less time reading the news In recent months, I've made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of time I spend reading the news, a change that has brought noticeable benefits to my daily life, my ability to self-reflect, and my overall mental health. We live in an age where news and social media surround us on a daily basis, and much of it is designed to engage us. Limiting my exposure to this information cycle has proven to be extremely valuable, allowing me to regain control of my time, maintain a clearer mind, and experience a greater sense of calm Imagine you open your browser, X, Instagram, Tiktok ...... every day and everyone is unapologetically telling you that things are bad. Can you be in a good state of mind every day then? Come closer, I'm telling you the real deal right now: this is how modern media works. These guys are cringing. Every day, over and over again, feeding you the same pile of garbage so they can take the opportunity to take control of your life, even the time and money you spend After reading many, many of these things, I eventually got bored and quit. Because news stories on social media are exaggerated and often emotionally draining. Modern media tends to sensationalize, constructing stories to grab attention in a way that maximizes shock or fear. Something as small as a fire in your city or as big as a potential economic crisis is usually given only an uncertain time period as well.blablabla...... These methods may suit the media's purpose, but they leave me feeling anxious and heavy. By getting out of this cycle, I freed up time that I can now spend on truly meaningful activities. I read more books, explore hobbies, and connect with others in a more genuine way. My day is no longer determined by the latest breaking news, but by my more intentional organization of my time Reducing my news reading has also increased my ability to be self-reflective. Without the distraction of constant updates and information overload, I was able to reconnect with my thoughts and feelings. In a way, reducing my news and social media reading has cleared my mindspace and made it easier for me to reflect on myself. I found myself thinking more critically and focusing on my goals, values, and personal growth, rather than getting caught up in endless arguments or worries about events beyond my control. This quiet time of reflection clears my head and helps me understand myself better and make choices that are in line with what really matters to me Additionally, reducing the amount of time I spend on social media has stopped me from regretting it. I used to spend hours scrolling through tons of information, and I would often feel regret or frustration afterward, wondering where the time went. Why was I sitting on the couch reading this? Why didn't I go do my homework or read some books, go to the gym, or even go play cards with my friends during this time? By limiting this habit, I've managed to redirect my time to activities that add real value to my life. This decision makes me feel empowered because I know that my time is being spent on something meaningful rather than passively consuming information All in all, staying away from constantly updated news and social media has made a huge shift for me. It has improved my day-to-day life, allowed for deeper self-reflection, and enhanced my mental health. Instead of reacting to news headlines, I now choose to focus on enriching my life and cultivating a sense of inner peace and purpose. For those who are overwhelmed by today's media environment, I highly recommend trying this approach - it may give you the clarity, peace and freedom you didn't realize you were losing",,,,,,,,
,Wentao,"Today, I would like to talk to you about the University of Amsterdam's undergraduate program in Computational Social Sciences, and as a second-year student in this program, I would like to talk about how my experience of attending it was. What are its pros and cons First, let's talk about the interdisciplinary nature of the program. Computational Social Science at the University of Amsterdam blends social science, computer science, data analytics, and math. You're not just studying sociology or psychology; instead, you'll learn how to use data-driven methods to explore complex social issues. Imagine analyzing real-world problems like the impact of social media on mental health or climate change while learning the computational tools to solve them in innovative ways. That's pretty cool, isn't it Another advantage is the break from traditional classroom learning. Many of the courses are project-based and involve collaborative work, and you'll be working on real-world challenges with your classmates rather than sitting in a classroom listening to lectures day in and day out. This approach not only makes learning more dynamic and engaging, it also gives you hands-on experience in applying your skills to real-world problems. Through these programs, you will develop teamwork, problem-solving and communication skills. In these programs, you also have the opportunity to work directly with professionals and organizations, which is invaluable for networking and understanding how to apply what you learn in the real world However, these experiences depend on how outspoken you are. If you unfortunately have a fear of frequent group meetings and speaking in front of crowds, then my advice would be to switch programs. In addition, you may also encounter some ...... less than “ideal” teammates and maddening demands from your project partners, so be prepared to accommodate and assist them in their endeavors Finally, one thing that many students appreciate is that the program relies very little on exams. You know, we college students have had enough of test after test. Compared to other undergraduate programs at UvA, we don't have exam weeks or make-up sessions, so we theoretically have the longest vacations, don't we The corresponding consequence, of course, is that, at least for me, the lack of exams to push me on, and relying only on essays and projects for assessment may be detrimental to my mastery of real knowledge. The advice I would give as a second-year student is to make sure you are prepared to study on your own. For example, in the second year, what you are taught in lectures and workshops is not enough for you to master the real machine learning, and you have to make extra time for self-study. At least 40 hours out of the week should be devoted to studying, and the amount of time spent on self-study is likely to be more than the total amount of time you spend listening to lectures Of course, UvA has long taken all this into account during the online matcing activities, which is why I strongly recommend everyone interested in the program to take part in the matching - it's the best opportunity to get a preview of the program once you get your con offer. If you have good scores and hold an interest in the program, then come",,,,,,,,
,Wentao,"Hello everyone Today, I’d like to introduce you to a writer I’ve recently been exploring, Gustav Meyrink. He’s a fascinating author whose novels are as mysterious and haunting as the man himself.Known best for his novel The Golem, Meyrink was an Austrian writer who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his works blend mysticism, surrealism, and philosophical ideas in ways that make them timeless and intriguing Meyrink’slife itself is something of a legend. Born in 1868, he was involved in the esoteric and occult movements of his time, experimenting with alchemy, mysticism, and even  freemasonary. These experiences deeply influenced his writing. He often infused his work with mystical and philosophical themes, questioning reality and exploring altered states of consciousness. You get the sense that he wasn’t just writing to entertain; he was trying to understand the nature of existence and the spiritual realms that lie beyond our everyday world The novel The Golem, one of his most famous works, is a great example of this blend of reality and mysticism. It’s set in the Jewish quarter of Prague, and it draws on the legend of the Golem—a creature made of clay. One thing that stands out in Meyrink’s writing is his exploration of duality. He often presents life as a balance between light and darkness, body and soul, or reason and the unknown. He had a deep interest in the occult, but he also wrote with a philosophical, almost existential tone. In The Golem, and in other novels like The Green Face and The White Dominican, Meyrink explores these themes of duality and transformation. His characters often go through personal awakenings, journeys that force them to question the fabric of reality and their own identities What I find particularly fascinating about Meyrink's work is how he writes about the quest for self-discovery and enlightenment. His characters are often searching for something beyond the material world - an inner truth, a spiritual awakening. Meyrink believes in the concept of the “higher self,” which he interprets through his knowledge of Eastern philosophy, Gnosticism, and Kabbalah. He seems to believe that everyone has hidden spiritual potential, but that this potential can only be unlocked through intense and often painful self-examination and transcendence of the self In reading Meyrink's novels, you almost feel like you are entering a world of ancient wisdom. His writing style is immersive and symbolic, which makes his books feel more like a journey than a simple story. The cityscape, the weather and even the architecture are full of meaning, as if every aspect of the environment reflects the inner states of the characters. The book isn't always easy to read - Meyrink's writing can be dense, and he doesn't hand you the answers. But that's one of the reasons his novels are so engaging. He encourages you to look between the lines and think deeply about what he has to say about life and reality.Thanks for listening, and I hope I’ve inspired you to check out Meyrink’s work",,,,,,,,
