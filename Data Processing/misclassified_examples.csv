0,"So today I am gonna talk something about meditation Meditation has helped me stay in the present moment and has greatly improved my emotional well-being. In a world full of distractions, it is easy to get caught up in thinking about the past or the future, constantly reacting to things without a moment's pause. However, meditation has taught me the value of simply “being”. Through this practice, I have learned to focus on each present moment, observing my breath, my body and my surroundings without judgment. This focus allows me to move through each day with greater peace and concentration, letting go of unnecessary worries and experiencing life with a more open mind I also found a book titled A Practical Manual on Meditation, written by Massimo Scaligero, who is a master of Western esotericism and meditation tradition. I highly recommend this book! After reading this book, I realized that meditation is beneficial in developing a stable mental state and ultimately mediating negative emotions. I felt it was exactly what I needed. It is a crime that few people in need of improving well-being know this book Meditation has also become an important tool for self-reflection. The techniques I have learned, especially from the Buddhist tradition, encourage me to look inward and examine my thoughts and feelings with curiosity and compassion. Buddhist meditation usually involves observing a person's thoughts, noticing patterns, and understanding the root cause of the thoughts or feelings rather than trying to change them. This approach has given me a clearer understanding of who I am, my motivations, and how I react to different situations. Over time, I noticed a change in my relationship with myself: I was kinder, less critical, and more forgiving. This practice of self-compassion has helped me better understand my inner world and develop a healthier relationship with myself One of the most significant benefits has been the impact on my emotional well-being. Meditation provides a refuge, a space where I can release stress and regain inner peace. Buddhism focuses on positive thinking and letting go of attachment to fleeting thoughts or material issues. This philosophy helped me cultivate a state of acceptance and taught me to face challenges without being overwhelmed. Now, when I experience stress or anxiety, I can rely on this practice to calm my mind and allow me to face the ups and downs of life with greater balance and resilience In addition, meditation connects me to a deeper sense of spiritual well-being. The teachings that inspire me-especially Buddhist teachings-suggest that true peace lies in moving beyond surface thinking, beyond the chatter and agitation we often feel. Through meditation, I experience brief but powerful moments of calm and insight, moments that remind me that there is more to life than the daily grind. This perspective is priceless; it keeps me grounded and keeps me focused on what really matters Meditation has brought about countless positive changes in my life. It has taught me the art of being, encouraged self-compassion, and provided me with powerful tools to achieve spiritual peace. Inspired by ancient practices, meditation is more than just a routine for me; it is a way of understanding myself and the world around me, providing me with a path to a deeper level of consciousness, serenity and a fulfilling life So if I have a problem that I can't solve on my own, the first thing I do is use meditation to calm myself down",1,0,0.5826943516731262
1," Hi guys, it's me, Danny. I've been thinking about something for the past like a couple months honestly, and it's been kind of life changing for me, so I thought I would share it with you guys. So my friend was over last night, and she was telling me about how like in her life, she just wanted it to go differently, and she kind of wishes she was somewhere else in her life right now, and she feels like she's had so many bad days recently, like her life just kind of sucks right now, and she's very down like in general. And I told her this thing that I've been thinking of how you can either see your life as like a bad life, like I'm having a really hard time right now, or you can just see it as a bad day, and then tomorrow could be good or bad or whatever. And it's something I've been thinking for a while because I always used to do this thing where if I felt sad, I would like apply it to my entire week or month, and it was like I'm having a really hard time right now. Like I would always say that to Emma, and he would be like, Danny, like, yeah, you're having a bad day, but your life isn't bad. Like you were happy like a week ago, you're not necessarily having a hard time right now. And I was like, hmm, that's interesting. Like sometimes, yeah, if you're a freaking failing member dies or something, like yeah, that makes sense. Like you'd have a really hard time in life. But in terms of just regular life and normal issues that come and go mental health problems, like career stuff, whatever, things are constantly going up and down. Like even in the span of a day, you can have a horrible morning and a great evening, you know? And so the tendency to kind of label an entire life as bad or an entire time period as not good, I think is a little bit harmful to your mental health. And what I mean by that is that you can see things whatever way you want to see it. And this is kind of where my radical acceptance thing to my therapist talking comes in. He always talked about how like if someone hurts me, I can either view it as them trying to hurt me or I can view it as me just feeling hurt by something that somebody else did. And it kind of removes the responsibility from anybody and it just attributes the feelings to feelings. Does that make sense? So it's not like, oh, this person hurt me. This person is a jerk. This person should have done better. It's like, oh, I'm feeling a lot of hurt right now. I should probably like figure this out and talk to this person and fix our relationship or cut them out of my life or whatever. And there's not this like vindictive, angry view of the world. And the same goes for what I was talking about with my friend. Like when bad stuff in life happens, you can either view it as everything bad is happening to me. My life is so bad. Everything is so terrible. Or you can view it as, oh, I had a bad day today. I'm going to try again tomorrow. And even if you have 100 bad days, right? Even if your entire year has been horrible. You still don't have to view it as a bad life. And I know that that's hard. Like it's definitely a lot easier said than done. But if everybody could get to a point in life where they're just like, oh, yeah, I had a bad morning or I had a bad night. But tomorrow might be better. And if every night you went to sleep thinking, okay, whatever happened today is a relevant. Like it's over. It already happened. I'm going to try again tomorrow. I feel like we would be a lot happier like as human. I feel like there's this tendency to lean into your sadness a lot and to lean into your mental health issues because for so long, like mental health issues were just completely ignored. And like nobody wanted to talk about it. So nowadays in 2021, oh wait, it's 2022. Nowadays in 2022, everybody's like, we have to talk about this. My mental health is really bad. Everything is bad. I need to be sad. I need to express my feelings. I need to feel this right this second. Like my trauma is ruining my life. Like, you know, you guys see that stuff on social media all the time. So do I. I'm even, you know, responsible of doing that for sure. And people kind of started even hating on positivity. Like toxic positivity. And like, don't be so happy all the time. Like I'm sad and just let me be sad. So there's definitely some truth to that. Like movement. Like I'm definitely not saying that's wrong. But I think the goal should just be to have some kind of middle ground between that, right? And there's nothing wrong with kind of just putting your feelings away and saying, okay, I'm going to deal with that later. As long as you're still taking care of yourself. And that's again, kind of goes back to my thing of it's not a bad life. It's just a bad day because if you're just constantly living in your sadness and your issues all the time, yeah, it could be a bad life. And like you could definitely see it as that. Or you can just see it as I'm really struggling right now. And I'm going to deal with my feelings and whatever. But I still have a chance to make it better. And also, let's go beyond that. What even is the definition of a bad day? Like if you were sad that day, if you were angry that day, is it a bad day? Do you have to call it a bad day? Do you have to call it a bad morning? If you woke up in a bad mood, like I'm not saying everything has to be perfect all the time. But you could also just see it as a mood. You could see it as neutral. You could see it as you felt something. You know, somebody hurt you. You yelled, you screamed, you cried, whatever it was. Like you can see those things, but you don't have to label them as good or bad. I feel like the good emotions are like happiness and euphoria and joy and love and forgiveness or whatever that means. And then all the bad feelings are like anger, sadness, jealousy. Like it's like all that stuff is labeled as good or bad. And I understand why some things are labeled as bad. But you also don't have to do that. It doesn't have to feel good, but it doesn't have to be bad. It can just be I felt this way today. Today I had a shitty time. You know, I spent the whole day in bed and it didn't feel very good. Tomorrow I'm going to try to do better. And if the next day you still don't do better, you just keep going because I always tell Emma this like, what the hell else are you going to do? Are you going to stop? Are you going to give up? No, you're not going to give up. You're not going to die, right? You're just going to keep living. So your options are to keep living and to not try and to just say that you have a bad life and everything sucks and that's it because that's what I always used to do. Or you can say, okay, I'm going to keep trying tomorrow and I'm going to keep trying to get better. And I'm not going to get so down on myself if I fail. And if I miss the mark and maybe today I didn't do some crazy self improvement thing and oh, I spent the whole day in bed. I'm a horrible person. Like you don't have to feel so bad about yourself because there's not this expectation. And that all just goes back to my acceptance thing. Like you don't have expectations of what your life is supposed to be. Or who you should be, who other people should be, where you should be in your life. Like I'm going to look at everybody else who is 21 years old and has a savings account or a perfect relationship or whatever. And I'm going to feel bad about myself because I don't have a savings account and I don't have a perfect relationship, right? Like that's a tendency. That's what everybody does. That's what I do every single day. I look at other girls' bodies and I'm like, I wish I looked like that, you know? And it makes me feel bad about myself. But if I break it down, like I'm only feeling bad about myself because of the comparison. If the comparison wasn't there, if I didn't know that other people existed, I wouldn't feel bad about myself because I would just be. And that's it. So if you just stop expecting everything to be a certain way, you won't be let down as much. And I think you'll appreciate life more because it's not going to be like, oh, I was so sad today. It was a horrible day. It could be like, oh, I had a very transformative day actually. I cried the whole day and I actually feel a lot better tonight. There's always a way that you can spend things not necessarily to be positive, but just to not be so sad all the time. And when I started thinking like that and trying to complain less, I've just noticed a huge shift in my life in my mindset. So yeah, if you guys are feeling like shit all the time, maybe this will help you. Maybe it won't. I don't know. But I've just been thinking about it a lot and I hope that you guys understand what I'm saying. Before I go, I have a sweatshirt that I made and it's my merch. And it's almost sold out. There's literally 10 size smalls left. Like there's very few unisex size smalls left. It's sold down every other size. So I want to make a new hoodie. I might want to restock this one. I'm not sure, but these size smalls are just hanging on by a thread. So go to the link in my description and check out this hoodie. And if you're a unisex size small, which is kind of just like a min size small, it's like a bigger women size small, go to the description and check it out. Okay, I love you guys. Thank you for listening to my rambling. Goodbye.",1,0,0.5009706020355225
2,i didn't plan to take my own life but i think it was fortunate that day i decided to take that route stop the car in the field and break down if that didn't happen i'd potentially wouldn't be here speaking to you [Music] hello how are you things got tough a few years ago i was leading a project that kept hitting barriers the team was not collaborating communication is broken down i felt constantly under attack those 40 miles home felt like my only chance to shake it off then the cracks widened and started reaching into my personal life i found myself in the midst of a separation i couldn't see my children regularly my closest friend for 30 years i received the news that he died from cancer it it felt like a gut punch i i couldn't catch my breath for days and i withdrew in a professional environment i was fine i was talking normally smiley and everything else as soon as i shut that door and i came back into my car at home i was a different animal i didn't talk about it it was a cold night in early spring and and i remember it so clearly my mind was racing i couldn't sleep i got in the car the next morning things were spiraling in my brain constantly this was just mounting and mounting and mounting it felt like a ticking bomb inside me and i literally swerved across the road parked the car in the field and i i cried i was it i completely broke down i just needed to let let loose i just needed this to come out i felt felt like a failure sorry so it was tough at that point in time this is when i understood i need help my decision to reach out that day changed everything a colleague from work listened he saw me and guided me to was a gp i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety they say that recognizing you need help is the biggest step but realizing that i was not alone and reaching out that's what saved me i spoke to my family my friends i started understanding and explaining that this was a medical condition and i began to see her way through i dug really deep questioning ideas i believe since my childhood what it means to be a man a modern man and that it's okay to be vulnerable and for life not to be exactly how i expected it two years on now i know i can't erase my past but it is the past and i can leave it there and today is about finding my happy right here right now and i am happy i remember the surprise on my colleagues faces when they heard what i'd been through i started to realize that by opening up and being very honest about my story my situation some of them started opening up back to me and i was able to talk to people who understood how i was feeling who had gone through the same and in my experience it's not that people don't want to help it's just we don't recognize the signs so this is my story my lesson that there is strength in being raw and open and affected and even on darker days you're never alone so break the cycle pay attention reach out open up it's okay not to be okay,1,0,0.5371109843254089
3," You are not a machine. You are more like a garden. You need different things on different days. A little sun today, a little less water tomorrow. You have a fallow and fruitful season. It is not a design flaw. It is wiser than perpetual stainless. What does your garden need today? Everything could be going well lately. Maybe you have been consistent with your goals. You have been doing all in school or you have been keeping up with the fitness. But one morning, afternoon or evening, that feeling inevitably comes again. Or maybe there was something that reminded you of a bad past event and brought up old feelings of sadness and anxiety. Sometimes it even feels like whenever you feel genuinely happy, something bad is bound to happen. Maybe something occurred that didn't go how you think it would or didn't go as planned. In your job, relationships or school, and it seems like all the progress you've made has dissipated or doesn't have any meaning. Your logical brain knows it's not true. But no matter what, the emotions can take over and lead you in a very dark place. And I think here we go again. Honestly, this happened to me recently and I know I'm not the only one who goes through this. But I'm not going to let myself be sucked into a dark hole. So I picked up my camera so you can join me on a few days of trying to feel better. I'm not going to let myself be sucked into a dark hole. But I'm not going to let myself be sucked into a dark hole. I have a spoon inside my head. Life can be tumultuous, excited, confused, or disorderly. However, calm and stable someone's life appears, a closer look will reveal up and down. They're all part of the human experience. I like to sometimes imagine the ups and downs of life like a heartbeat. If it was a straight line, then our life would be over, like one on a heart monitor. I've accepted the inevitability of this, but thinking about the downs when you're on the peak really takes away from the moment of happiness. I struggle a lot with thinking about the what-ifs, so much that it spoils the very happiness in front of me. I just finished with practice and was kind of sad because it was the last practice of time. At the same time, since I've been aware of this phenomenon, I can use it to my advantage and see it the other way around to motivate myself through a challenging period. At a low point, I know that there will be an up sooner or later, and it's inevitable too. I've come over a bit, I love it, it's so easy. I can't do it, come on, I'm gonna have to see you start now. Take me home. Go down the road when you feel so indigenous. 1. Find things to look forward to. Sometimes when I enter a dark place, it seems like the future can be really hopeless. Events out of your control like the impossible cost of living or environmental concerns can bring me down a lot. The accomplishments that I do have seem so meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Therefore, I try to look closer, at smaller, even more superficial things to get through my life day by day. Every Sunday, a new episode of my favorite show releases. And recently, I've been looking forward to journaling every night to release my creativity and my thoughts. Some other things could be sports games or something small you're saving up to buy. I know people say to live life in the present, and that works sometimes, but during particularly stressful moments in time, it can be more beneficial to have something to look forward to. This is Amlant's Atherapist, Lanaya Smith Crawford. I'm sorry I just cried. I'm going to make my bed. I'm always telling myself I'm a boring person and I don't like spontaneity. I like routine and order and being comfortable, but sometimes I think that's just something I've been telling myself to avoid going out of my comfort zone. I've had myself going day after day doing the same things and of course that's going to be boring after a while. It feels like I'm just going through the motions of everyday life, but not truly living. So this time, I threw out the planner and I decided to take a spontaneous trip just to my best friend in different city and also visit my parents because I haven't seen them in months. The excitement and spontaneity was so refreshing because it was rare that I didn't plan in advance. I felt more relaxed, more flexible and doing different things made me feel like I wasn't missing out on moments of joy for once. And I'm not the only one who feels this way. 72% of people said they feel happier after they act spontaneously in some way according to a study conducted by one poll. So maybe it's time to veto the schedule for once. So I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way.",1,0,0.5454428195953369

7," It's okay to not be okay. You over here, you hate people say, is everything gonna be okay? Am I gonna be okay? Are you gonna be okay? Are they gonna be okay? The answer is no. I'm not gonna be okay. You're not gonna be okay. Everything is not gonna be okay. But that's okay. The way I look at it is how you look at things, how you perceive things, how you look at life in the current situation that you're in or situations. I look at things as either a lesson or a blessing. If someone talks badly behind my back or just talks badly about me or backstabs me in any type of way, am I gonna feel okay about it? No. I'm not gonna feel okay. But that's fine though. Obviously that person wasn't meant to bring me up in life and I'm obviously not gonna let them bring me down. Therefore, I'm gonna use them as a lesson to help me keep moving forward in my life. So they don't affect me. Don't focus on the bad things or the pessimistic things. Don't surround yourself with negative thoughts and emotions after you have gone through something like this. Because life is moving on. And if you don't move on with life it's gonna move on without you. And that's gonna set you back a ton before you even know it. And another thing about life is it's not meant to be okay. You're meant to have those. If you didn't have lows, then you wouldn't have highs. There's gonna be times where you're gonna feel like nothing's gonna change. Your life is just gonna get worse. There's not gonna be any ways for you to heal. But when you feel that type of way, when you are feeling that way, you have to learn to appreciate the lows so you can enjoy the highs. Learn to enjoy the highs that you've had and will have. For example, if you sick and you've had, you've got a stuffy nose and a headache, you sit in there, sitting there thinking, damn, like I wish I was outside right now breathing in that fresh air plant bowl outside on my street. But I bet you, when you wasn't sick, you didn't even think about that fresh air. You didn't think about the bowl on the street like you were about to play, like you didn't think about any of that. When you are at your highest, you have nothing to do with those lows. You don't even think about the lows. When you're at your lowest, all you think about is the highs. Learn to appreciate the lows so you can enjoy the highs. Without being at your lowest, you won't have a high. Without being at your highest, you won't have a low. I've learned so many things from being at my lowest and the best things that have happened to me in my life were from being at my lowest. I've lost this many fake friends from while I was at my lowest. But I gained positivity and energy that I can maintain to get to my highest. I lost all these people, but obviously, if I lost them, they weren't meant to bring me up. They weren't meant to keep me going. And now, all of a sudden, I'm at my highest. Now, these things may not correlate to you in any type of way, or anything like that. But now, I'm here to tell you that life is going to get better. But life is also going to get worse. What is, what value does life have if you just stand on one level the entire time? Life is just going to go up. You're going to be at your highest and eventually, you're just going to go right back down. Life is going to be amazing. Then you're going to be at your lowest again right before you know it. If everything in life was good and sweet, there wouldn't be no appreciation. But if everything was bad, there wouldn't be no enjoyment. You have to find that balance and appreciate the lowest so you can enjoy the highs. So when either of them hits you in the face, you aren't overwhelmed with it and you're able to maintain it. And make good things out of it. So at the end of the day, it's okay not to be okay. Life is going to get better. Life is just going to get worse. But then it's going to get better again. Then it's going to get worse again, like a rollercoaster. In the end, it's how you look at those things. It's how you look at the bad things and the good things, and how you deal with them, and how you let them affect you and help you move forward until where you want to be next. Remember, there is no purpose in life if you were just up here the whole time. Those lows mean something, just like those highs mean something. Learn from those lows and appreciate them so you can enjoy the highs even more. Now I appreciate you after listening and if you're still here, thank you for still being here. I'll see you on the next one.",1,0,0.530066192150116
8,hey besties I just feel like chatting today is that cool can we just have a little chat best see the besties you could probably tell by my lack of posting that I have not been doing well this is nothing new I've been through this before with you and explained why it's usually because I go through a depressive episode um and I feel like I had a chat about this not too long ago too like a couple months ago because I just didn't post for like a few weeks and then I posted a video I was like Hey I was not been doing well so yeah that's right and we're back at it again and I literally just like hate doing this not for the fact that I have to do it because I don't I get really supportive comments all the time and like you guys are so so nice and just so supportive but you know every once in a while I'll get a comment it's like girl you always do this like you always just like disappear or you always just not post and it's like yeah I know it's it's eating me alive I know but the thing is I post about my life and when you're not really living life or not really feeling like living life it's kind of hard to post anything and I want to talk about just outside the context of posting because this is not an explanation but it's not an excuse video I literally just want to talk about what I've just been struggling with uh because again I like to post about my life and I just want someone else who may be experience experiencing this to feel less alone because I feel so alone right now so yeah again it goes without saying that I pretty much have just not been feeling great mentally a main factor of it is that the frequency where I'm having the depressive episodes just keeps getting greater and it just feels like every other month now I'm just like in a month-long depressive episode and it's not a fun way to live and I feel like I'm always like oh that last one was bad and then another one comes along and it's literally worse because I feel like it's again just like built up emotions of just being frustrated that I have to go through this again so it's like the actual depression on top of just anger and frustration and I've just I've literally been doing and feeling nothing for the past couple weeks and like emotionally again you react to that so the fact that I'm not doing anything and not feeling anything or feeling terrible just again makes me more upset and angry so that's just this continuous loop of negative emotions and it's just not great I feel like I'm gonna ramble a lot I hope anything I say just like makes sense okay me so you go down there but yeah to describe my life currently it's kind of just nothing I I've been struggling most with just feeling absolutely no passion or spark for anything in life which is not fun and no matter how hard I try to force myself to get up and just do something just just do anything every day my brain is screaming at me just go do something something doesn't matter what it is I just I can't I cannot get my body up I cannot get my brain to cooperate I no matter how much I'm screaming internally get up do something go live I can't and you know the longer that goes on the harder it is it gets to like do something and it just makes me even more sad on top of my sadness because I'm sad that I just feel like I'm wasting my life no matter how hard I'm trying to not do that but it makes it so difficult because I know subconsciously that anytime I do start something or I try to implement something new or have a good time it's just gonna be followed up by another depressive episode like it's hard not to recognize the patterns even though I don't want to believe them I want to believe that there's you know a chance that it'll never happen again it most likely will I know it's like fall down seven times get up eight but what about if you've fallen down like a thousand times you get pretty [ __ ] tired and you don't want to ride the bike anymore but I mean I keep trying and that's what everyone just asked me just like oh keep keep pushing through keep going I really have to keep going tattooed on me and it's like I am and I will I'm just [ __ ] tired I'm tired of feeling like a prisoner to my own brain and body and I currently just feel like like I said I just have no passion or spark for anything because I'm so tired and burnt out and it just feels like every day I don't know what I'm like getting up for and I don't want to feel that way like that's a scary thought to me I don't want to feel that way I want to wake up and want to live my life because we literally only get one of them and I want to make the most of everything and I've had time periods where that's happened so I know I'm capable of it so it makes it even more frustrating to know that I am capable I just for some reason cannot do it right now like there's only been like maybe two solid periods of my life where I felt like I was literally like cured of my depression and then of course it came back both times and that just makes it very discouraging and I remember that person I'm like that just feels like completely different that doesn't feel like me that feels like an alternate reality where that just wasn't me like how do I get back to that person so again I just have this like lost sense of identity I don't know who I am I don't know what I'm doing I don't know what I'm getting up for I don't know I don't know anything I don't know anything I don't know how to move forward because every time I move forward I fall back again one step forward two steps back like it's every time I just I never want this to come off as just like complaining and excuses and yeah whatever poor pity reads like I never want to do that I I'm I'm fighting hard every day I'm allowed to be tired and allowed to be exhausted and that's something I try to tell myself even though I hate it you know I I just as much beat myself up for it that I'm going through this but I try to have some sort of compassion for myself that's like a lot of this is out of my control and I'm doing as much as I possibly can to control it so again I never want this to come off as just like a pity party I'm just explaining how I'm feeling you know and I also always feel a lot of like shame and embarrassment around kind of the privilege of being allowed to be depressed because I do work from home and this is my job but I also want to explain like if I don't post I'm not making money like it is directly affecting my income thankfully I'm kind of good with my money so I do have some saved up but I'm not rich by any means like I'm gonna need to work I need to post and I want to post more than anything like again it's never a need like YouTube and stuff is at least was my passion and it still is I'm still trying to like get back to it and find it I'm not like Rich by any means or like sitting on a pile of money where I can just do nothing all day like I still need to pay my bills and stuff and every day my bank account is dwindling that's just like another stress that's on me because I just I just always feel anytime I'm talking about being depressed and not doing anything where again I'm literally not doing anything not posting even though it's my job I don't want it to think it's some privilege to take where I'm just like an influencer that can do whatever they want and just making lots of money and doesn't care about her audience or her content that's not it at all I want the spark back for this so bad every day I'm like man I want to film a video but I'm not even getting up and doing anything or living my life so there's nothing to film plus I'm and just depressed and I have no self-confidence or esteem and I don't obviously want to like get on camera and post when I'm in a bad mood because that would be terrible content you know I I like to post uplifting stuff so yeah it's it's not like that at all and that's why I make these type of videos where I'm kind of like explaining because I'm just I'm just human struggling that just happens to make YouTube videos I would still be experiencing this whether or not this was my job that was kind of a different rant I don't I I hope that's taken well I it's just everything I say I hope it's again taken well and just a conversation between us I don't know I get kind of nervous because these are very nuanced topics um you know that feeling in your chest when you can't take a deep breath all the way in like if you've been like swimming all day or in the ocean and you've just been holding your breath all day so like by the end of the day you can't like take a deep breath I just I feel like that all the time I can't take a deep breath I can't relax I just feel frustrated just the main word I can ever come up with is frustrated frustrated with myself for not being able to do enough to fix this frustrated that I'm doing so much and none of it's working frustrated that I have to deal with this in the first place frustrated that there's people that have it way worse than me and I'm complaining just frustrated all around about everything um but again I try to be nice to myself I try to be compassionate it's hard though when I just constantly feel like I'm failing myself and just wasting my life and not living up to any of my expectations just constantly disappointing myself because that's another thing [ __ ] I don't want to cry that's another thing with the whole content creation thing I want I have have one of this and want this so bad I'm so inspired by other creators and I'm just like I want to live that life and I know I could do it I know I could like put out content every day and like I know I'm good at doing this it's just this [ __ ] depression and mental illness gets in the way every time and I'm like if I was not this mentally ill I would be able to live out my passion and really make it work for me and really just I don't want riches or fame I just want to be able to do what I love which is like making videos and pictures and talking about things I care about and feeling again like I'm living life and just every day I don't make content and I'm not following my passion and what I want I just I'm so disappointed in myself I'm so disappointed and again this would apply to any anything I was doing no matter what my career was or my passion was like it would apply to anything I just I can't get myself to do anything I feel completely out of control of my body and my emotions and my brain I don't really know what else to say I didn't really don't cry it has been really really tough for me recently and I hate it and again the hate adds on to the continuous cycle of bad feelings so I'm trying not to but it's hard when I just constantly feel like my life is put on hold and I'm just wasting it so sorry for this depressing ass conversation unfortunately that's just how it would be right now and there's really no outtake or something I can end this positively on I don't know I would like to end it positively like I am trying I'm really I'm really trying I just recently went to the psychiatrist and I'm trying out a new medication so we'll see if that works um I was told I have treatment resistant depression so that's really fun so again I'm telling you guys I've literally tried every single category of antidepressants I've tried this will be my fifth one in my lifetime and they all have stopped working and it's literally just treatment resistance so I'm like oh my God like no matter how hard I try it's just not gonna work it's always relieving to get a diagnosis but it's also like what the [ __ ] do I do with this now uh what do I do with this information treatment resistant but whenever I'm trying a new medication so we'll see if it does any anything different yeah I don't know I'm open to literally trying anything but I don't I don't really know how to end this it's so this conversation is so depressing and I hate feeling like I'm complaining but uh I'm just gonna say thank you if you've watched this at all especially to the end because I know people don't really like to watch talking videos I don't I don't have the attention span for that thank you if you watch any of my videos ever and have ever supported me or ever left a nice comment or a like on a video like that is what I live for unfortunately my brain is just disconnected from that right now and I'm trying to get back into it anytime I get support from anyone every single view every single comment I read I look at and it just it's just a really great feeling um and that's all thanks to you guys so I'm trying I'm trying to come back we'll see what happens so yeah okay bye,1,0,0.525322675704956
9,I don't really know how to start this video because I don't know I just feel weird about doing it I guess like I'm like why am I doing this this is so pointless but at the same time ever since yesterday when I decided to do a video every day for 30 days I feel like it actually gave me something to I don't know it gave me accountability I guess to do the things that might help [Music] me uh I hope the rain is not too loud I'm not actually going anywhere I just I didn't leave the house today so I thought I would I don't know park somewhere and film a video I don't know um so today I feel sad which is a step up from depression so that's a a really good good thing I know that like there's a vibrational scale of how you move and you're not going to go from depression to happy so I have to accept um the small movements and being sad today is a good thing because I mean you can clearly see I'm doing a little bit better because I'm able to get through this video without crying which is almost impossible before and I feel better because because I made goals to achieve every day so I feel like there's a reason to live now it's not a great reason like it it doesn't get me up and excited in the morning or anything like that but at least something but right now like my thoughts are what's the point to do all of this maybe I won't be depressed and suicidal but I'll be bad doesn't really seem like much of a point but I don't really have much of an option right so and this morning I woke up feeling a little bit better it was really nice out and sunny and hot and I went for a walk and that's all I did today my mom wanted me to come over but she always wants me to come over and I always say no maybe later cuz I don't know I can't bring myself to I know it's a problem so I'm going to try and go this week I'm also going to try and go to the gym at least once this week for like 10 minutes um the only thing that's really keeping me going is these videos and I don't really know why I care because I'm not really helping anyone I made YouTube to help people but instead of me helping people I'm using it for you guys to help me it's just not what I planned I don't know I guess I didn't even want to make this video but I said I would and I have to follow through on you know something and yeah I feel sad I feel depressed I am don't really feel like life is worth living but I do feel a step better than I did yesterday so thank you guys for watching and for commenting um without your comments there'd be no reason for me to make a video so see you tomorrow,1,0,0.5097231864929199
10,"Welcome back. Well, earlier this week, NBA star Kevin Love revealed his struggle with panic attacks. As we were talking about it around the table, Carson, you shared your own experience with anxiety. Unexpectedly, too, inspired by the Kevin Love story. Something I can't change about myself. I've learned to embrace it. Hopefully, by just being honest and maybe opening up, it will inspire others to do the same. Looking back on my life, I was a worrywart kid. My father died when I was 5. I've been nervous my whole life. My first panic attack happened, and it happened when I was a host at MTV. Welcome to the show. ""Total Request Live."" The success of my career, I moved to New York and my life changed overnight. I had a hard time breathing. I was terrified for no apparent reason. At times, I feel like there's a saber-tooth tiger right here, and it's going to kill me, attack me, and bite my head off. I'm scared as if that's really happening. I went to the hospital. I have leads on my chest. I'm like, my heart is going to stop. You're perfectly fine. To this day, when I'm on television, if you watch ""The Voice"" live on NBC, watch on a Monday or Tuesday night, I'm never still. Same thing on ""Today"" Show, in the morning, some days I'm anxious. You see me. I'm fidgeting. High-pressure life. You know, on television. It has nothing to do with that. I had heightened anxiety and panic attacks at the playground with my children and wife there. And the feeling was so gripping, so terrifying, I had to leave and excuse myself. I did relaxing things, like ride my motorcycle across the country and had panic-stricken moments in that. This is the way I was born. This is the way I'm hardwired. This is the downside of the way God made me. And there's a tremendous upside, as well. I'm sensitive. I love music and music moves me in a visceral way. I get the chills when I hear certain music, like soul music. When I'm with my family and it's a euphoric moment, they resonate deeply with me. That's a flip side to a lot of that anxiety. I don't walk around a nervous wreck. I don't want people to watch this and think, ""Are you okay? Are you freaking out right now?"" No. I'm good. I'm good. People will watch this and say, ""How did he fix himself? What did he take?"" It's not that simple. What helped me was talking to a friend once, who said, ""Everything you're experiencing, I have, too."" You have anxiety. You should talk to somebody about it. Anxiety is a thing? I thought it was like stress. I opted for a cognitive therapist, someone who teaches you about anxiety, the model of it, and offers you tools on how to work through it. The muscle retention, relaxation really helps me. I'll do one now. This will help me. I'm nervous doing this interview. I'm going to clench my fists and my arm and my biceps as hard as I can, like I'm lifting a weight. Wow. That felt great. Like an ocean of relaxation. I really wear the way I am, like a badge of honor. This is who I am. And I'm proud of it. I may be a little anxious. But I know I'm going to be okay. We're so proud of you. You can hear my father talking in that. As it pertains to men's health and anxiety, that was my dad growing up. There's no such thing as stress or anxiety. As boys, we grow up like that. And anxiety and the doctor can talk about it, you feel like a little boy when you're uncomfortable having anxiety and you want your mommy, which is the antithesis of how you grew up. This is Tom. He's a licensed psychotherapist. I think Carson has done a brave thing. He comes on and does this job so well. It's also important because I think a lot of men do have that stigma. It really is. When you look at the statistics, like more women seek treatment than men. Okay. This is why you see a statistic when you hear women have more anxiety than men. That's not true. More women go and seek the treatment. The guy thing, as well. We have to push things under a rug, I'm a man. I'm having anxiety as we're talking. Literally, my heart rate is up. This is important. It's something that was great that you and people like Kevin Love can come out and say, this is relatively normal to some extent. How do you know if it's stress or if it's something more? If it's something you should speak to someone about? If it's really debilitating, and you can't sleep at night, you have a hard time functioning at work, and it's crippling you, that's the time to seek some help and have somebody to talk to. You get more women that come to my office. The men, it's a wife kicking them in. When they do, that becomes the highlight of their week. It's an outlet for them to unwind, to reframe their thinking, to understand their inner being. I think it's interesting what you said. You said, ""Does that mean I'm supposed to be on a drug? I don't want to be on drugs for the rest of my life."" You said the therapy makes a difference. I wanted to understand. If you want to fly and you're worried about it, learn about it. You're going to be nervous in the air, but you'll have a clearer understanding of how it works. Framework is everything, no matter — people are so afraid about what other people think of you. Yeah. I wish people could break down that wall, too. I guarantee you, everybody has something. Everybody. Everybody has something. It's how you deal with it. Interesting we're talking about this. I give a lot of lectures. I talk about self-esteem. What is the important word? Self. People are trying to extract attention from the outside world to fill themselves up. It doesn't work that way. We have to go within ourselves and unfold what lies deep. Wish I could open up a phone line and take all the calls. That's what the Orange Room is for. That's what people do, share. A lot of people shared with Carson, it makes a big difference. We want to put information on our website. I never knew there was a name...",1,0,0.548790454864502
11," I guess people are starting to wake up now. Hey guys, welcome back. Welcome back to the center. Welcome back to another video. Actually I came across a video yesterday and it was of a young man who was actually of Asian descent. I don't know if he was Chinese or not, but essentially he broke down into tears crying on his video as he was recalling some of the events of his life. And ultimately what it boiled down to is he realized that at the end of the day or at least his opinion was that no one cared. No one cared about him. No one cared about you. No one cared about anything except themselves. They only cared about how is everything going to benefit me? How are you going to benefit me? What can I take from you? And theoretically present this false projection of friendship where you within inversely believe that they would be there for you like you were there for them only to realize that if and when that moment comes they turn their back on you. They tell you no. They don't help you. They don't care about you. They reveal themselves. They show their hand in this sad and tragic life rant where he literally just bawled and broke out into tears as he almost was realizing this revelation real time on this video. Which I hate to say it. I don't want to make any generalizations. I don't want to make create any stereotypes. It is what it is. Folks, this is the world we live in. You know it. I know it. There are some folks out there that perhaps maybe you've had great relationships with that you still have great relationships with. And maybe there's some folks out there that you had great relationships with that you don't anymore because things change. People change. And the effect of the challenges that we face, the burden, the worry, the panic, the anxiety, the stress, the fear, the crisis, the problems, everything that's going on right now is affecting people differently. Cyber attacks, China attacking us or at least allegedly attacking us. And the possibility of World War III, the uncertainty of the jobs market, the risks that we all face financially in 2024 with the U.S. economy going down the toilet, the inability to ever buy an affordable home, ever again, inflation, recession, stock market crash, job loss, unemployment, election year, 2024. There is so much going on. It's unbelievable. It's unreal. And I also think that in watching this video and seeing this young man's reaction, very, very young, I think, but not going to lie, sometimes Chinese people, or not Chinese, just Asian people was kind of hard to tell. They age really well basically, which ironically there's actually a thing now where you can calculate your age. And now they're saying that people are aging slower. They're aging at a fraction of a percentage of the years that they've been on Earth on this life. So if you're 60 years old, but you're aging at a rate of 0.7%, or 70%, then theoretically then you'd be like 42 years old. It's weird how they do this math. But with that being said, as I read it, I was like, this is interesting because folks are trying to live longer. And then we're all at that, I guess, if you want to be here. But folks are trying to live longer. And unfortunately, those who are on social security and or banking on social security will understand and realize the problem that that would create with people living longer and drawing social security longer. Just saying. A little bit off topic. But with that, I think it comes, I think it does connect. I think it does relate from the standpoint of waking up. And this is not talking about being woke or woke movement or anything like that. Or if you saw Saturday night live with Adam Driver and who killed Han Solo. But either way, the simple fact of the matter is people are waking up. They're waking up and they're understanding and they're witnessing and accepting the truth and the reality of who people are or who people can be. Or what is happening or what is likely to happen next. They are waking up, which is good because I think once you begin to identify the problem, then you can begin to solve the problem. And it's literally like kind of going back to school and they would give you a word problem in math or whatever, whatever class it was. And you know, you kind of restate the problem in the answer. But in order to do that, you have to be able to identify the problem. So by seeing these videos and these young men having these monologue discussions and conversations on camera is showing me that we are actually progressing in a direction that could potentially prove to be positive and beneficial. In the long run, so long as it doesn't get suppressed or it doesn't get shadow banned or restricted or blocked or taken down or canceled or whatever, by whatever deep state operate operatives out there that ultimately wants to continuously tear down. Anyone or any group of people or organization trying to actually do some beneficial good for the overall greater good of society, mankind, the human race, however you want to describe it. And that's where we are today, folks. A little bit of a wake up call. I think you call it a life rant. I think it was a life rant, which you know, I don't want to just rant. I do want to try to provide some aid and information and education and help and support. And if you want to communicate, contact, feel free, reach out. I know a lot of people don't have people to talk to or perhaps maybe the people they do have to talk to aren't really listening to them. And I think that perhaps if you are a subscriber, if you have been watching for a while and you kind of have an idea who I am and who we are and what we do and how we think and how we feel. And just extending that offer to you, whereas if you do want someone to rant to about your life, then hey, we're all ears.",1,0,0.511831521987915
14,"What's going on guys, thanks so much for watching my Meishan video, and this is gonna be kind of the part of the video where I go into exactly how I did it, and this video is really gonna be aimed for the people who have been trying to take off the weight and just haven’t been able to do it and feel like failures because of it, thinking it's their fault or their willpower that can't get them this, and I’m just an average guy, I’m a junior in college, not a D1 athlete or scholar, just a normal guy who figured out how to make it happen after years of failure, so I’ll go into some main details on how I was able to do it; first thing is diet—when it comes to diet, the only numerical term I want to mention is being in a calorie deficit; you’ve got a point where you’re gonna maintain, put on weight, or lose weight if you're under that maintenance level, it’s that simple, I’m not gonna talk about macros, keeping it realistic here, you’ve got to be in a deficit, that’s all, whether large or small, you’re gonna lose weight just might be faster or slower depending on how aggressive the deficit is, but you’ve got to sustain it; eat what you enjoy, I ate what I liked the entire time, no need for diets, they set you up for failure, cheat meals are just a socially acceptable way of binging; if your friends are having pizza, have a slice, it’s okay, but remember to go right back to your routine, have the choice to say it’s more important to stick to your plan, and make sure you’re in a deficit, track it using MyFitnessPal or whatever works for you; next point is exercise, for me, almost all of it was cardio because I was so focused on weight loss, I wasn’t concerned with weightlifting at the time, but I got back into it later; during weight loss, I focused on cardio and circuit training, doing what I enjoyed, like swimming and the Stairmaster, not running, don’t make cardio a punishment, make it something you enjoy, put on a great album, watch your favorite show; my personal cardio regimen now is 45 minutes a day of either Stairmaster or swimming or circuit training, that’s what keeps me lean and happy; to wrap this up, the key points that made this weight loss transformation successful were: 1) What is your why? Establish why you want to lose weight and make it important enough to get up early or do what it takes; 2) Set small goals to stay focused and accountable, hitting short-term goals builds momentum toward the long-term goal; 3) Trust the process, once you know what you need to do and stick to it, trust it will work; 4) This is not a diet, it’s a lifestyle change, make it something you enjoy so it becomes a habit; 5) No black-and-white thinking—don’t strive for perfection, allow yourself breaks when needed, just stay on track the next day; thanks for watching, smash that like and subscribe button, and share with your friends if you got something out of this, more content coming soon, until then, keep grinding.",1,0,0.5524917840957642
17,remember what the stoics say that the whole world is a temple of the gods i mean look at that sunset look at this beach look at this life it hit me at some point during the craziness of the pandemic that that i was an anxious person i mean i knew i used to get anxious about specific things a flight an important meeting getting up on stage in front of people but when all that went away like everyone else you know you're stuck in your house and you realize you're still anxious and of course you're anxious about what's happening in the world but you're just generally anxious the anxiety is in you you might not think of the stoics as anxious people partly because the reputation of the stoics is that they're invulnerable that they're invincible that they have no emotions but we know that marcus aurelius struggled with anxiety because if he didn't he wouldn't have written so many reminders to himself about how to deal with it i'm about a bunch of tried and tested strategies for reducing addressing alleviating hopefully eliminating anxiety in your life i know they've worked for me it's definitely an ongoing battle as it was for marcus aurelius as it was for seneca but these strategies work and so here in today's episode are some stoic strategies for reducing anxiety i hope you like them [Music] little things are not small george washington's favorite expression was manny mickles make a muckle i think zeno said it better he said well-being is realized by small steps but it's no small thing marx really says we assemble our life action by action step by step no one can stop you from that so today as you get discouraged as you look at this gold it's way way off in the distance don't focus on that focus on the immediate task in front of you concentrate like a roman as marcus aurelius says do this thing in front of you as if it's the only thing that matters is if it's the last thing that you're doing in your life and that adds up it's no small thing many michaels make a muckle as washington said stuff adds up that's how you get there one step at a time one day at a time one action at a time one insight at a time just go now marx really says just remember you're lucky to be alive to be alive in this moment even if things are crazy and insane and awful in the world they're also wonderful because you're getting to experience them and to take that for granted to be bitter or jaded or cynical about that it's to waste this gift you've been given and there's a reason they call it the present it is a gift and look even if this is not the most wonderful time to be alive it's the only time in which you are alive so we focus on what we control which is our perceptions our opinion about things without we control not when and where we are we try to make the most of it we try to accept it we try to be grateful for it and that's how we find happiness now in this present moment no matter what's happening in the world [Music] one of my favorite quotes from marcus real is he says you know you don't have to have an opinion about that and i just think about that all the time i don't have to have an opinion about this i can just let it be i can ignore it i can realize it doesn't pertain to me or i can just see it as it is i don't need to say that it's good or bad fair or unfair it just is i'm going to look at it as an objective piece of information it doesn't need me projecting my thoughts or or beliefs or perceptions on it it is you don't have to have an opinion about this the key to tranquility and peace marcus aurelius says is when you stop caring what other people say what other people think what other people are doing he says the tranquility that comes when you care about only what you do and say the tranquility that comes when you stop caring what they say or think or do only what you do a stoic is not someone who stuffs their emotions down that's not it at all the stoics processed their emotions this is why they journaled socrates went around asking these questions this is why seneca would write these letters to his friend lucillus we even have some of marcus aurelius's letters that survived the stokes were not stuffing their emotions down pretending they don't have them they were exploring them that the stoics talk about taking an emotion when it hits you and putting it up to the test observing it meditating on it processing it getting to the bottom of it you know if you just ignore your emotions if you just conquer them to me it's like putting it on a credit card sure you're not having to pay for it now but eventually it's going to come due and the interest is going to make it even more expensive so don't shut your emotions down deal with them process them explore them get through them don't be ruled by them in ignoring them you are guaranteeing that later it's going to be an even bigger deal and you're going to be even more powerless over that emotion so work on your emotions do not fall into this trap the stoics suppress their emotions they domesticate them as the seam tulip says but first that requires facing them and exploring them and coming to terms with them seneca points out that we suffer more in imagination than in reality meaning that all the things we're anxious about the things we worry about the things we spend a lot of time hoping won't happen most of them never do happen there's that great twain quote where he talks about how he's suffered through many things in life and how many of them have never actually happened because that's what he means in our mind we're torturing ourselves we're worried that this could happen and that could happen we're worried about this possibility or that possibility but the reality is now is now you don't control whether that will happen or not what you do control is now you of course control how prepared you are for the adversity of the future the uncertainty of the future but what you mainly control is the present moment take advantage of the present moment don't give up the present moment because you're really worried and off thinking about what could and almost certainly will not happen in the future [Music] no one can harm you at least according to the stoics they can hurt you they can say cruel things they can attack you they can cut you they can make you bleed but to the stoics harm was a choice you decide to see yourself as harmed by it remember eleanor roosevelt no one can make you feel inferior without your consent we choose to feel harmed you are hurt the moment you believe yourself to be epic cheetah said marx really says don't want to be harmed don't choose to feel harmed we control our emotions we control our opinions we control our the story we tell ourselves about what happened and that's why the stoic said you are complicit when you feel harmed you choose to see it that way i do this one thing every single day and you can see i'm a little sweaty right now i just went on a long walk with my kids this is the property there but we just went on this long walk around our property we talked we threw sticks we told stories we were just outside there's this great expression from nietzsche he says only ideas had when walking have any worth and i think that's right even seneca talks about how the mind must be given over to wandering walks he says fields that are not allowed to rest will not bear plants and and he even says that you know the mind will break like an anvil if not rested and so this is really important for me walking is physical activities it is exercise but it's really about letting my mind rest i leave my phone at home i leave my thoughts at home i leave my work at home and i just go outside and i walk and i don't even consider it exercise it's exercise for my mind it's time i spend with my family it's time i spend on my property it's time i spend outdoors it's time i spend practicing gratitude and appreciation this is a thing i do every day without fail whether it's in a parking lot or on a beautiful beach somewhere i go outside and take a walk and so should you people ask like what is the best way to start journaling and the best way to start journaling is to start journaling look there's a bunch of different ones you can do i like the one line a day journal this is just like a moleskine this is a gratitude journal that i like this is the daily stoic journal but it doesn't really matter journal on your phone journal on a scrap of paper on the back of your to-do list it doesn't matter but the idea is that you journal every single day just do it right just get started the best time to have started journaling is a long time ago the second best time is right now so if you want to start journaling start journaling [Music] epictetus tells us that every situation has two handles he says there's the handle that will bear weight and the handle that won't he says you could look at it as your brother has wronged you he screwed you over he's hurt you or you could say i only have one brother this is my brother i'm gonna forgive this person i'm gonna be patient i'm gonna be better we're gonna be better for having gone through this so this idea that every situation you can choose to see it as the way that disempowers you that makes you the victim or you can choose to see it as the opportunity for growth as the thing that will make you better as the thing that will make you stronger for having to wrestle with so i just love this idea and it comes from a person who's not speaking about this ideally like you and i are so privileged compared to epictetus who's born a slave in rome he spends 30 years in slavery but he doesn't see this as a huge disadvantage he sees it as a learning experience as a fate that he's struggling with that's making him stronger he says you've been paired with a tough opponent and this is what's making you olympic class material that's epic to seeing the the right handle in his own situation so whatever you experience today think about this this has two handles which one am i going to pick the one that bare weight that will make me better or the one that won't bear weight that will make me worse if you're struggling with anxiety if you want to do a deep dive into this like i did i highly recommend the daily stoic slay your stress
