https://youtu.be/tKk94y8Auis?si=kAxKCNkzV8L5mph_,Marysia,"hello everyone today I've got another cool video for you I'm going to show you how to create and run an ethereum sniping boot using AI power chat GPT and guess what it's already making me passive income daily and I guarantee you you will make a profit if you do everything according to the instructions the sniping bot keeps an eye on the blockchain hunting for new tokens and massive price changes when it spots an opportunity it acts like a ninja quickly buying or selling tokens before most Traders even realize what happening this gives us an unmatching advantage to cast in on those price differences the bot Secret Sauce is its ability to find tokens just as they listed or when there's a sudden price movement it uses smart algorithm to identify this movement and boom it makes the trades for you so you can just sit back and watch the profits roll in if you're thinking man this sounds way too complicated don't sweat it it's actually pretty easy and you don't even need to know any of that coding mumbo jumbo just stick around and let's get this thing rolling all right let's get started hey Chad GPT write me the code for a smart contract on ethereum to automatically hunt for sniffing opportunities to earn ethereum [Music] [Music] there you go Chad GPT is running a code and I bet it's better than any human could possibly think of then head over to eth remix dobot remix is a web three application that allows us to develop compile deploy and launch Smart contracts coded in the solidity language I'll put a link to remix in the description below make sure you have the metamask browser extension installed and you're connected to the ethereum main net if it's your first time on remix it may ask you to agree to their terms I've already done it head over to the sidebar on the left and create a new contract under the contract folder we're going to name it bot. Sol next copy this code from chat GPT and paste it into the bot.
O file you've just created this is our snipping trading bot I will also place this code under the description so that you can copy it if you don't have access to chat GPT a couple of things to look at after pasting the code in lines 15 and 16 you can follow these address using ether scan these are the addresses of wrapped ether tokens which we'll be competing against you don't actually need to have any wrapped ether yep perfect it's the official wrapped ether address always a good idea to check that back to remix now that our bot file is ready let's compile it click here as you can see here it's built with the 0.6.5 version of solidity under compiler select the 0.6.0 version so that it matches our contract also make sure that the language is set to solidity and evm version is set to default now click on the compile bot. Soul button and wait for the bot to compile now we're going to deploy this to our wallet head over to the deploy and run transactions tab in remix here you'll want to select the injected web 3 as the environment we need to confirm the contract on the blockchain by paying gas fees gas fees are the commission on the ethereum network for smart contract deployment now the deployment under utility is ready to go click deploy I always set the gas fee to high there's usually not much of a difference and it puts the transaction through much faster now we wait for the transaction to confirm sweet we can see here that it is confirmed meaning our smart contract is deployed now you can see the various functions for our smart contract start enables the bot to start monitor ENT in the markets and withdraw stops the bot and transfers funds back into your wallet with the smart contract deployed fund it with some ethereum which will be used for trading make sure you get the right address there you can fund the contract with whatever amount of ethereum you want but keep in mind that the more you put in the larger the trades you'll be able to make and potentially more profit you can accumulate over time [Music] sweet there we go the transaction confirms that the funds were sent to the contract we can make sure by checking our contract address on The Ether scan once again ensuring our ethereum is in the contract nice it's got one ethereum which is the amount we funded the contract with last step is to click Start this will enable the bot to start sniffing the mempool to find different liquidity pairs in order for you to sandwich transactions let's set the gas speed to high save and click [Music] confirm all right guys it's been a little over 6 hours now and it's time to check the profits the bot made so as you can see I have about 1.3 ethereum which is 31% of the profit already I'm going to let my bot run for about another 6 hours and withdraw the profits after [Music] all right let's see how much more we made nice it's a little over 1.5 ethereum so it basically took me a half a day to gain over half of my deposit back that's pretty impressive the bot will continue to run until you click the withdraw button when you click withdraw the bot will stop trading and return to the total ethereum you've entered initially including the profit back to your wallet so let's click it this will charge us a little bit of gas I'll set it to high again and then click confirm there we go then transaction confirmed let's go to our metamask and see what we have now you can see the balance from the bot is already now in my wallet this is only after running the bot for more than half a day unreal I've even had weeks where I've made 3 to six ethereum sometimes even more the profits will fluctuate week to week guys share your profits in the comments below drop a like and don't forget to subscribe for more profitable ways to make passive income using web 3 tools",How I get 1-2 ETHs per day thanks to bot.

from chimpanzees right it is crazy right you know I was reading the other day and apparently humans and chimpanzees I always thought we evolved from them but I guess we just evolved side by side you can be smart while also being humble and also sounding like you touch grass the key is to teach people what you know without making them sound dumb this way people will actually learn from you which will make them see you as smart and respectable now how do you find these books it's actually really easy you don't have to read the same five books everyone tells you to read just think of a topic you want to learn about like cleaning now Google books about cleaning here's one that looks good usually these books cost money but if your finger slips you might accidentally end up on this website and you might accidentally search for the title of the book and by chance click on the first link and oh no accidentally downloaded a file and opened it with the appropriate ebook viewer well now that you have the book you'll also find that not only can you pick out interesting tidbits to use in conversations but you can also learn many useful skills there are 10 things you should know before you learn a skill one unless you practice the skill your brain will think it's useless and forget it two you only have have to know 20% of the knowledge to master 80% of the skill so I guess we could just move on this is called the learning curve it's a graph of how good you get at a skill over time as you can see just by practicing a little bit you can make a lot of progress in the beginning but you have to practice no one ever learned how to tie a tie by watching how to tie a tie you only learn how to tie a tie by watching how to tie a tie while tying a tie the same applies to reading books only make you smarter if you give your brain a reason to remember the stuff in the book so once you read the chapter on cleaning a bedroom go ahead and clean a bedroom doesn't even have to be your bedroom just clean one and now you'll never forget it but let's just imagine that's something that you can't practice right now like imagine you're reading a book about cars and then you see this diagram of how to jump start a dead car with a good car ideally you'll read about it and then go practice it but not everyone has two cars lying around to practice on but you can still practice it by just imagining imagine the moment where you'll need to know how to jump start a car put yourself in the situation find a video and pretend that's your car by imagining the whole process from start to finish you just convinced your brain that you used all that information and now you'll remember it meanwhile the person who just looked at the diagram and tried to memorize it still won't know what to do if they ever had to jump start a car this is how you get smart use everything you learn and if you can imagine yourself in the moment where it'll be useful this is basically how the entire school system works you learn a piece of information and because it'll be like 15 years before you actually use it your teacher creates an imaginary situation where that information is useful that is a test an exam that has questions on that exact piece of information and if you get it wrong you fail or in South Korea you get prison time just kidding that's only if you cheat this is usually in enough to make your brain at least attempt to remember the information the only problem is once the test is over your brain says it's not useful anymore and you forget it some people think repetition or space repetition or studying in intervals or mind mapping will help them get better grades and learn faster but in reality doing practice questions will give you the most results because they simulate the actual situation in which you'll need to use what you learned if you don't have any practice questions make your own and convince yourself that the stakes are high like pretend that you're hanging off a cliff by one arm and someone's there to pull you up but only if you can name all the parts of a human cell learning information and making it seem useful to your brain is all you need to get smart and this is why textbooks are the S tier format for becoming smart as fast as possible there's no fluff no handholding no distractions just pure information and a bunch of practice questions and if you can't solve them you have to flip all the way to page XXX VV I II in the appendix to get help textbooks aren't for the Casual learner because it's not as fun as watching a YouTube video on the topic and forgetting it all an hour later but if you're ever up to the challenge there is a website you might accidentally end up on where you could accidentally download free textbooks on any subject you want but before you do","becoming smart is easy, actually",19.02.2024,"easy, actually",Man,30s,07:32,8,"0,9993"
https://youtu.be/bynWmFkVIkE?si=SeVWEOMfaKS61kfP,Marysia,i bet you wish you were as lucky as this guy hey sir congratulations on winning the jackpot lottery here's your check for one billion dollars oh finally man thank you so much i just want to say that i wish i saw this youtube video with this asian guy with glasses that talks about the nine highest paying jobs without a college degree because if i saw that and i wouldn't be riddled with student debt right now um but it's fine i have a i have a degree and i'm working a minimum wage job still everything's fine and this this check this check is going to help out a lot by the way with my student debt hey friends vincent here and my goal is to make personal finance accessible through bad jokes and puns and the reality of the matter is that the cost of college is too damn high people are drowning in hundreds of thousand dollars in debt even before they start the first day of work so if you don't want that to happen to you but you still want to make a ton of money then good news you don't need college to make a boatload of money did you know that the national median salary is a little under 40 000 so i went ahead and i hand carry the top nine highest paying jobs that pays double what the national median salary is and there's even a couple of jobs that pay well over 100 000 and all these jobs do not require all together now without any degree without any degrees really guys that was that was really sad and horrible they don't require a degree there that's that's what i get for trying to have a little bit of pizzazz now although i went to college a lot of my friends didn't and they're still doing great in life and yes some of them even have the jobs that i'm going to be talking about and some of them even make more than me if you're on the fence of going to college or if your immigrant parents like mine are pressuring you to go to college by saying you won't make enough money without a degree definitely check out this video first to see what your options are and although these jobs don't require degrees some of them may still require some certification or training but still all this in the grand scheme of things is a lot cheaper and a lot quicker than going to college electrical repairs have a median annual salary of eighty two thousand seven hundred and eighty dollars and on the high end one hundred and ten thousand one hundred and ten dollars before i tell you what they do did you ever wonder what those little sticks in the ground are called well this is called a tree but this is called a power line and these guys carry electricity all to your home and if one of them snaps well then this happens okay guys seriously can we turn the lights back on i just watched paranormal activity electronic repairers are responsible for testing maintaining and repairing power equipment around the city because modern infrastructure is entirely dependent on electricity so you'll be going around and inspecting electrical equipment to make sure everything is gucci and if something breaks down then who you gonna call ghostbusters no no no guys come on get with the program who are you gonna call electronic repairers there we go this job is a good fit for people who can read and digest work information because you could be working on different equipment every day you also want to be able to solve problems very quickly on the spot and have some really steady hands and if you don't then well you should probably check out the next job to be making that sweet 82k salary you'll need a high school diploma and potentially complete an apprenticeship or other employer training program which could last up to three years power plant operators have a medium annual salary of 84 650 with a high of 129 530 dollars and if you ever watch homer simpsons then you pretty much have a day in the life of a power plant operator minus the nuclear part you'll be working in a control room just like homer to monitor and control different systems that produces electricity basically you'll be managing the source of the power before it gets to the city for the electrical repairs that we've just talked about previously this job is really good for people who are good at communicating and solving problems because if there is an issue then you'll need to work through it with your team since the entire city or the entire state is dependent on you for power you should also be comfortable working in high pressure and really stressful environments which now that i think about it is the complete opposite of homework maybe that's why he wasn't very good at his job you'll typically need a high school diploma or equivalent for this job or even be certified hold on even be certified through the north american electric reliability corporations system operator certification program or nyers ska cup nice scop next up is elevator installer and repairs and fun fact one of the scenarios that i play over and over in my head that gives me a ton of anxiety is going into a crowded elevator with a bunch of people where you're shoulder to shoulder and you really have to use the bathroom and then all of a sudden the elevator stops working that gives me so much anxiety just thinking about it so elevator people please do a good job here please the elevator folks would be maintaining installing and fixing elevators and escalators and you'll be working with different components from brakes control systems and even repair cables and for this you get a wonderful median annual salary of eighty eight thousand five hundred and forty dollars with a high of a hundred and twenty eight thousand 500 this job is a good fit for people who have a good grasp of wiring and machinery are persistent have a high attention to detail and are really good at problem solving to be an elevated person employers typically require at least a high school diploma and potentially an apprenticeship program and all the job training and depending on your state you might also need a license to operate computer programmers have a median salary of eighty nine thousand one hundred ninety dollars and on the higher end one hundred forty six thousand and fifty dollars now true story in between jobs for a few months actually taught myself some computer programming languages like python html and css thinking that it'd be nice to be a computer programmer and have all that flexibility but fast forward a few weeks i finally landed my first interview and you'll never guess what had happened i was prepping for a few days you know i was trying to get confident and i was feeling good but on the day of the interview i was super nervous mom spaghetti and i had a complete brain fart a brain freeze and literally forgot everything and i had to leave the interview super embarrassed and i was apologizing profusely now you didn't ask for the story but i wanted to share the lesson that i learned which is to never give up because and you won't believe this again a few weeks passed i got another interview different company and i did so well at this programming interview that i got the job and i was promoted to the chief technical officer on my second day i'm just kidding i never applied to another programming role after that again i was scared for life and i closed that chapter sometimes there's just no lessons to be learned computer programmers create write and test programming code that allows applications to be run in in order to be a computer programmer you'll need to learn some languages and no english doesn't count it has to be a computer programming language like c python or java to be a good programmer you have to be really good at problem solving being able to understand technologies and systems and logic and having a basic understanding of math like add subtract divide multiply despite what you might think you actually don't need any degrees you can learn everything you need to know online for free or you can go to a paid coding bootcamp which are much cheaper in short in college and i actually had several friends that went through boot camp and they actually really really enjoyed it and they said the best part is at the end of the bootcamp they actually bring in companies that are looking to hire computer programmers so a ton of them actually graduate with a job already in hand next is distribution manager and they're in charge of coordinating planning and directing the transportation of all goods for a company like if your company sells sofas then you're responsible for getting the sofa from china to retail stores in the united states efficiently and cost effectively so you're basically nick fury where you coordinate plan and direct avengers to kill evil things and protect earth but just a little bit less cool in real life now i always thought that this was automated but it's actually pretty manual and hey i can't complain it pays really well with the median salary of ninety seven thousand three hundred and forty dollars and a high end of a hundred and sixty nine thousand five hundred and ninety dollars you'll be a good fit for this job if you have really good problem solving skills have high attention to detail you handle your stress well and you're able to cooperate with a bunch of different people you don't need a degree for this 97k job but you should have a high school diploma have multiple years of working or managing a warehouse and have a really good understanding of shipping technology today next up is database manager with a whopping median salary of 98 860 dollars and on the high end 155 660 database managers organizes and stores data which is immensely important nowadays when everything done is based on data you need to make sure that the company data is available to those who need access and not accessible to those who don't need it and at the same time you need to be able to strategize disaster recovery plans upgrade databases and constantly test new software because this industry is a growing at unprecedented rates this job is really good for people who have a really good visual understanding of things they can see hidden patterns they have some basic math skills and are just super dependable people similar to computer programming although you don't need a degree employers do want to see at least a high school diploma and at least some classes or courses in database development however the most important thing that they want to see is you having experience in database languages such as sql or sql construction managers will be planning supervising and coordinating entire construction projects from the flow of workers materials budget to scheduling and construction workers is a really perfect blend if you have a general interest in building a design and this blended job has a absolute crazy median salary of a hundred and two thousand nine hundred eighty dollars with a high of one hundred fifty nine thousand four hundred and seventy this job is a perfect fit for people who have great communication leadership organization and problem solving skills because you're pretty much going to be using that every single day but the absolute most important thing for a construction manager is to have extensive extensive on-the-job experience or be heavily specialized in the trade you can also make yourself more attractive by getting a certification in construction management next up is a computer security analyst reporting for duty security analyst your mission is to briefly protect your company's networks from outside intruders think of yourself as gatekeepers where you'll be monitoring and responding to data breaches and cyber security attacks thank you sir and for being a protector of the internet your median salary is a whopping 130 590 and on the high end 163 300 although some companies prefer a degree many don't require one and they just want some prior experience and some certification and the last highest paying job without a degree is an air traffic controller with a median salary of one hundred and thirty thousand four hundred twenty dollars and on the high end 184 thousand seven hundred and eighty dollars air traffic controllers direct air traffic from the ground and the air and make sure that people take off and land safely and efficiently to minimize any delays this job is the absolutely ultimate domino effect because think about it if anything is delayed in one airport let's say jfk if flight is delayed then that will disrupt air travel throughout the entire country and even parts of the world this job is a perfect fit for people who have really good communication and organization skills they can pay attention to details and they're able to very quickly think on your feet now you don't absolutely need a degree but it is preferred to have an associate's degree from an air traffic training initiative but you can also be considered if you have three years of progressively responsible work experience you'll also need to pass the air traffic controller specialist skills assessment battery as well as take the air traffic controller training course at the faa academy as you can see a college degree isn't necessary to make a high salary in fact these are only some of the highest paying jobs out there which you can get out of high school and with some additional training and maybe certification there are a ton more high-paying jobs out there and depending on where you live you may or may not have some of these opportunities like i know some of these jobs like the air traffic controller you might need to relocate to a city that actually offers this role one thing i want you to take away from this video is that there are a ton of options out there there is no right or wrong path and i don't want you to feel like going to college is the only right path out there maybe some of these jobs speak to you and maybe they don't and that's okay if you're still searching there is absolutely nothing wrong with that just make sure you're constantly exposing yourself to as many things as possible so that one day you can be expired to choose the right path for you and just the fact that you're even watching this video is a fantastic start you don't need to follow the traditional path from high school to college to make it nowadays you have a ton of options available now and if you're immigrant parents or just parents in general are pressuring you to go to college maybe you can show them the list these lists of jobs where you can earn a ton more than people coming straight out of college and you won't be riddled with debt and remember just because these jobs don't require a degree it doesn't mean that they're easy to get they will require a lot of time a lot of preparation and even maybe money to get started because you need to get certification and go through training getting these jobs is not easy but nothing in life that's worthwhile is normally easy but one thing is for sure if you do successfully get one of these jobs then your return on investment will be huge already especially with the median salary that's already double the national median salary now for me if i didn't have this youtube channel or if i didn't go to college if i had to completely start over from zero i would have chose the computer at the same time with all this flexibility i would be working on my own little projects that hopefully would become bigger,9 Best Highest Paying Jobs You Can Learn (Without a

other people coming in there it's always a floor under under departures [Music] we're talking about the early 70s and back at this time and like all teenagers i absorbed the counter culture as much as i could and thought that revolution was what was expected to fight back against any authority i went to a a private school but it was terrible it was all boys and boring well i was asked to find another school over an incident with the chemistry teacher he accused me of wanting to make up a batch of lsd of all things but really i didn't quite fit into that this was a time when drug use was not particularly underground my my mother's friends were pot smokers and i wasn't even a regular smoker but on the the melbourne and the australian drug scene hard drugs were not massively distinguished between anything else cocaine and heroin were just some things that were also available a girl i knew worked at a cinema a boyfriend was a safe cracker when i got to know these guys they retired from safe cracking it was they were too well known and they used to buy up a whole lot of grass and weed when they could and some hash but they didn't have any way of getting anything bigger and they were saying that it was really impossible for them to bring it in and being a little smart ass that i was i thought really and so that was the attraction i'd left my day job and had to get funded by one of the guys from the safecrackers group now he gave me a few thousand dollars and and really didn't hold out much hope that anything would come of it how did it work in my case badly i made as every conceivable mistake possible when i first landed in india in search of hashish to get things going i got swindled outside american express by some con men there you know offering discount rates then couldn't find a good connection i even turned to the shoeshine boys on the street who managed to score me some pretty rough edge but smokeable sort of hash but persistence and time will lead you to the connections you need to make i had so much to learn i was lucky i survived a lot of errors i arrived back in sydney with almost six kilos of hash at that time there was um they didn't use the systems that they developed it was just one guy behind a a desk and he unzipped my case asked me where i'd been of course and he looked inside inside there was a 1950s grunting radio a big old thing that had once had tubes and dials and levers inside but now had nothing there was no clever packing in this one it was the hash bricks were just wrapped up stuffed inside stuff so firmly the casing was buckled at the top this customs officer knew perfectly well i mean he even spun the dial of the radio and it kept on spinning no levers moved he knew what it meant he looked around to see if anybody was watching because he wanted to let me go and he looked at me rather firmly and said are you going back there no no no we'll see that you don't and you can take your uh radio we'll call it and get going what this family man didn't want was to propel me into the jail system the world of prisons i guess he was experienced enough to know what that would mean but you can imagine for somebody [Music] just turned 19 as i bounced out of the airport terminal thinking myself the cleverest smuggler around in fact just some halfway that been given a break i began a series of operations with um a series of drug runs where i was taking it myself my wife at the time an italian girl who father had restaurants she was honored me not to be doing it myself so i found helpers couriers i found one in what turned out to be the best courier i'd ever had this guy ran a couple of plant shops um she she over decorated things with venus fly traps and crawling pumps and things he ruined them he was just a spender of money it was perfect for me and he could imagine himself in different worlds i had peter once run we went out of bangkok he had two kilos the swap was done and he arrived at belgium the system then was to change passports in europe so that your endpoint in this case it was a transfer in the uk you would arrive with documentation that said you'd only been in europe and i watched peter arrive now without any suggestion from me he turned himself into what was clearly a professional tennis player he arrived in white shorts and t-shirt uh even had the racquet in his hand and it was an expensive one he was giving the mx card i'd given him for expenses a thorough bashing on that one and i asked him what he was thinking as he came through untouched of course he said i was thinking of the matches i've won and the games i've played and this was the kind of person who made perfect couriers how did you move into the position where you could actually be arrested and imprisoned in australia what was the journey there the end came about in australia due to arrogance i was still after all only in my early twenties what did i have hmm i had a office a couple of houses spent money carelessly but not publicly but i'd been reported now i knew the police were following me because in those days before encrypted radio signals we could listen in on them when the day came that um i write back home and said to my wife clearly hey some poor guy being watched in the area grab my hand held and go out and take a look maybe i can tip him off i threw the handheld in the car switched the remote control for the garage door and on the radio said yeah the garage door is coming up i said what a break the guy's going out just now i'll really be able to watch him i had the lcd is backing out we can see the ford and he's got a ford so i'm starting to realize that this is me being watched and there were no slouch operatives and i was given 15 years of which i had to do 10.
at the end of a long sentence the usual course is that people in low security prisons and go home to a welcoming family though i had the welcoming family it wasn't the usual path i was at a very low security prison but i was being followed from my day leaves home police were watching me they had even visited me to say that they kind of missed the old days when they used to chase me around and i found that when i got home they were there when i rented a flat they were there they'd leave little notes and abusive messages on my answer phone i couldn't move without them so i backed away and i left the country because i knew it would never end with them the plan was to go to europe to come back to london i'd had a few things here i had a safety deposit box here so a little money but most of it was in thailand because i'd taken it back there with my friend lee my contact there it was a very odd thing to arrive in thailand i'd taken such precautions to get there i two false passports that i'd gone through virtually from the grave up from the the death certificates and birth certificates nobody could know that i was leaving because that would be the end too after three days of unknown freedom in thailand i went to the airport to continue my journey i went to the check-in desk and handed over my passport and i was already getting an odd feeling but who doesn't at an airport check-in and then she cross-checked against a list and she said i just a minute i have to check something she walked away with that passport there are moments when in the blinking of an eye you know that everything you have done has failed i looked up i could see a railing a couple of uniform guys watching me i could see some plain clothes watching me and actually froze for a minute because there was no of course there was a theoretical backup plan there there has to be the second passport but it was just to walk away from everything again i'd lost one life a second life the one that i just left in australia but i didn't really have time to take a think about that i did back off i picked up my travel bag the important one with the money in the second passport and went down to arrivals if you ever have to flee an airport don't run out of departures because that's we're expecting you to go go down to arrivals because a lot of other people coming in there it's always a floor under under departures i found a taxi in the middle of a scrum of probably hundreds and through a lot of argument with his fellow drivers bribed my way back onto the highway going into town driving back there even with the window open my head was burning with rage that i can't tell you how careful i'd been i thought i'd been so that nobody could detect where i was arriving back into the city i took two talks in a motorcycle as well go to a travel agency we knew uh old players retired a little travel agency in bangkok i could use their phone and maybe work out where to go next as i arrived there in an arcade having and all these steps to lose people i see a pile of cigarette butts opposite but you take these things in the corner of your eye as i walked into the treble agency and headed for the phone i could feel the swing of the door behind me in the air coming in and i connected it with a cigarette butt somebody been standing there waiting somebody knew that's where i'd go to i turned and there were three plainclothes thai police they said various things but it didn't matter one had a gun but there's nothing i could do about that take it out and shoot myself it's the only shot i'd get off as i was taken into chinatown police station i saw the american dea agent that i knew from the australian case bill shenman and a couple of australian faces that uh no doubt liaison staff after arrest you spend seven days in the local police cells then you get transferred to a court and that not going well and it never does you go to the main prison i learned many and terrible things about the thai courts that virtually everybody is found guilty you can fight your case and it means you take longer up to five years even pleading to a case takes a year and a half but i couldn't do that i was charged with the false passport um the money which was now written up as uh four thousand dollars seemed to have disappeared and they'd done a little sweep of the airport and found enough drugs to see me face the death penalty it only takes over 25 grams for an airport case and that will put you on death row i would be found guilty as and within two weeks sentenced to death from the moment i stepped into that prison in bangkok escape was on my mind i had my nose glued to the cracks in the cell bar on the sleeping guard probably 60 feet down the way but the first stroke of that tungsten steel on these old bars seemed to carry throughout the whole building in an escape there's one thing for sure everybody is alone up until this point everything's okay you know we go to the baggage thing our bags ain't coming yeah everybody else has got the bags right and then the police just come around with guns and save tamira you boom hands up in the air",International Drug Smuggler On How

https://youtu.be/MmEgejLoY50?si=YMtChaJ4Lr1z4hZu,Marysia,"Hi, I'm Anne De Luca, and I'm the Associate Dean for Admissions and Financial Aid at Harvard College. We know that there are a lot of pieces to the application and we ask you for a lot of information that can feel really overwhelming, but we don't want it to. This video is going to break down all of the different components, and we're going to do a deep dive into the Harvard supplement. When we're making admissions decisions and talking about applicants, we're looking at lots of different information. We're looking at your academic information, your extracurricular experiences, what your goals are for college, and what you're hoping to get out of the experience. This is really a chance for you to tell us about yourself, and you want to be sure that who you are and what you've done comes through in a really authentic voice. That means you're going to want to spend time on all of the different pieces and maybe ask someone to help you look it over. Make sure that it reflects who you are and what your goals are for your education and the future. If you're planning to apply for financial aid and the application fee is a barrier for you, don't worry. We have fee waivers that will take care of the application fee so you can apply without any cost to you or your family. Take a look at the link below, and there will be details about how to request a fee waiver. Hi, I'm Joyce St. John, director of admissions at Harvard College. So, where do we begin? First, you need to fill out an application. At Harvard, you have two options: The Common Application or the Coalition Application powered by Scoir. Each application includes biographic information, a family section, and some information about your educational journey. You can include testing information as well if you wish, but remember, Harvard is test-optional, so it’s up to you whether or not to include that information. In whichever application you choose, there will be an activity section. That’s a place where you can let us know about the things you do outside of the classroom. These things could include school activities, sports, music, family obligations, or work obligations. Don't worry about the number of activities you list—just be sure to tell us about the activities that have the most meaning to you. A great place for you to let your voice shine is through the personal essay. Don’t overthink which topic to choose. Pick a topic that matters to you. This will let the admissions committee get to know you better. So you've been through all of the common parts of the application, and now we come to the last piece of the application, which is the supplement. Many schools will have supplements and ask you for additional information beyond the general application. Harvard is no different. We have a supplement where we're going to look for details that aren't asked about in the common part of the application and some specific essay questions that give you more opportunity to tell us about who you are and what you've done. The first question is: Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a diverse student body. How will the life experiences that shape who you are today enable you to contribute to Harvard? In this question, we're hoping you can do some self-reflection and try to identify the experiences in your life that have really influenced who you are, what you believe, what you think is important, and what you want to study. The second question is: Briefly describe an intellectual experience that was important to you? The foundation of your college education is the intellectual experience you'll have with our faculty and with your classmates. So, tell us a little bit about what excites you intellectually in your high school experience? This could be a class, a project, research experience, or a summer opportunity—whatever makes you excited about learning is what we're hoping to find out about in this question. The third question asks you to briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who you are. For this question, my tip would be to pick one activity that is very meaningful to you—something that you participate in outside of the classroom. This could be an extracurricular activity, but it could also be a work obligation or your family responsibilities. The fourth question is: How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future? First of all, I want to say that we’re not going to hold you to the answer to this question. It's OK to change your mind between now and when you graduate from college. That said, we are looking to get a sense for how you think a college education might help you fulfill your goals and your dreams for the future. We’re confident that we can provide you with the right education and community to make those dreams a reality. So, tell us a little bit about that, whether it's a very detailed vision or just a broader sense of what you're hoping to accomplish. The last question asks you to identify the top three things your roommate might like to know about you. Residential life is an essential part of the Harvard experience. In this question, we’re curious to see how you might present yourself to another first-year student. Imagine you're in the dining hall for the first time, and you meet someone new. What three things would you really want that person to know about you? Some students feel like there’s additional information they want the committee to see that doesn't really fit well into the common part of the application or the supplement. If you do have supplementary materials to share, you can do so through SlideRoom if you're sharing artistic things like paintings, drawings, performances, or through our application status portal if you're sharing research papers or posters. So this rounds out all of the pieces of the application you'll complete, but there is additional information that you'll ask others to send on your behalf. You’ll ask for your high school to send an official transcript. This is a listing of all the coursework you've taken and your performance in those courses. You’ll also have a counselor letter of recommendation. In the U.S., this is from someone who is a counselor at your school who knows you well and can share information about your accomplishments, your experiences, activities, and your goals for the future. In some cases, you may not have a counselor who's able to write a letter on your behalf, and that's OK. You can have another adult who knows you well write for you in this space. Harvard requires two teacher recommendations as part of your application. This is usually a teacher you've had in the last year or two, and they’ll be able to talk about your experiences in their classroom and your preparation for college-level coursework. This doesn't have to be from your hardest classes, and it doesn’t have to be from the classes where you've necessarily gotten the best grades. These should be from teachers who know you well, who understand your intellectual experiences, and can talk about your curiosity, the way you engage with your classmates, and your performance in those classes. Congrats, you've submitted your application, but you're not done yet. There are a few things we’re going to ask for along the way in your final year of school. First is a mid-year report, which is a request to see your transcript after your first term in your senior year. This is going to show the coursework you've taken and the grades you’ve earned, usually by the end of December or the beginning of January. If you're admitted, we’ll ask for your final transcript, which will show the remaining coursework you've taken and your final performance in those courses. Or if you're in a country that has national exit exams, your performance in those exams. As part of the application process, you might be offered an alumni interview. This is an excellent opportunity for you to talk to someone who went to Harvard, for them to get to know you, and for you to ask questions about their experience. You can read more about that on our website. All of these pieces come together to provide a complete picture of who you are and how you hope to engage in our college community. I hope you decide to apply to Harvard, and if you do, we look forward to reading your application.",Harvard 101: What you need to know about applying to Harvard,20.09.2023,Harvard College Admissions & Financial Aid,woman,40s,08:14,9,"0,9996"
https://youtu.be/Q0uXGQu55GM?si=M6uhXcn4BeDr27Id,Marysia,I have spent the last decade of my life immersing  myself in the field of finance and money through a   degree in finance a qualification in accounting  and then a career in Investment Banking and one   of the most life-changing skills I have learned  through it all is how to handle my own finances   recognize my bad money habits and break free from  them so in this video I'm going to share with you   nine of the most common bad money habits that  hold people back and tips on how to break out   of them number one paying yourself last I first  heard of this in the book Rich Dad Poor Dad by   Robert Kiyosaki and it's one of the blueprints in  achieving Financial Freedom Robert explains that   the way people pay their bills can be broken down  into two types the first way is the Poor People's   habit and that is through paying yourself last  so as soon as your paycheck comes in you then   pay your rent your phone bill your subscriptions  you find your social plans and then you'll save   whatever's left over if there is even any money  left to save the second method he talks about is   the rich people's habit and they do the complete  opposite they pay themselves first and that is   what you want to do take 10 minimum and put that  into your savings account the minute you get paid   treat it like paying a bill this is so important  and by doing this you're guaranteeing that that   buying their things before you pay yourself the  second bad money habit is getting comfortable   with bad debt it seems that debt these days is  actually the norm people are using debt to by   the smallest of things to buy presents to buy  clothes I have a straight wall that is unless   I can afford to pay for that thing outright and  cash I shouldn't be buying it with any form of   debt remember credit card companies want you to  be bad with your finances because that's how they   make money from this the average credit card  interest rate is 22 which cancels all kind of   benefits and rewards these credit card companies  are providing if you're not able to pay them off   number one which is about paying yourself first  and essentially it's saving enough so that you   this six months of buffer it's through that paying  yourself first start putting that 10 away and once   you have your stockpile then you can start using  the additional money you save to building into   your investment fund and looking at Investments  number four is not knowing your income or expenses   properly until you know what your starting point  is how do you know where you want to be there's   something called lifestyle inflation and that is  your spending will rise as your income Rises the   more money you make the more you spend and it's  a cycle make more money buy a bigger house buy a   financially they know their assets they know their  liabilities they have a clear goal on where they   want to go financially and all this all the steps  they need to take to get there are more likely to   get a lot of money and build wealth compared  to people who just fantasize about money but   have no idea how to go about it how they plan to  acquire it or how to manage it just being mindful   of their stuff and seeing those numbers in black  and white will trigger you into action fifth bad   money habit is having expensive Hobbies a lot of  people like to shop and I guess yeah part of this   if you want to improve your financial position you  can firstly save more of your existing income or   you can make more money and create more income  streams and the ideal combination is a mixture   of both you can't build wealth if you're making  more money and spending all but you also can't if   you're just focusing on the saving side because  there is a cap to how much you can save using   those cashback sites will only get you so far so  to truly build wealth you have to think of both   sides of the equation both how you will save a  larger percentage of your income but also how   you will make more money saving moneyside has a  cap the making money side does not it's infinite   there is unlimited potential upside whether it's  investing in the stock market asking for a pay   rise starting a side hustle you want to break the  bad money habit of thinking about saving money   is going to massively increase your wealth number  seven paying too much in taxes taxes are going to   be the single biggest expense in your life whilst  everyone has to pay tax a lot of people just   wealthy they have knowledge of illegal corporate  structures that come with tax advantages they hire   tax advisors that help them minimize their tax  bills so if you want to get one step ahead one of   the best ways to increase your wealth is through  understanding tax rules in a way that's stack up   in your favor for example investing through  an Isa or a Roth IRA which is an investment   account that shelters your dividend and profit  from taxes or operating under a business instead   if you are someone who disagrees with this and  prefers to pay more taxes regardless of whether   or not you can reduce it legally then it doesn't  hurt to understand the tax rules and reduce that   tax bill so that you can instead use the money  to give back to things that directly align with   your values instead of letting someone else decide  where that money should be going if you want me to   make a video on tax I was planning to I already  have a summary on what I want to include but I   have been a bit skeptical about whether to release  this it's a topic that can go either way so let   me know in the comments below if you want to see  that number eight waiting too long to invest when   you start having savings you have that stockpile  that buffer that we spoke about then you want to   start looking at investing that money so that  your money starts working for you and you want   to diversify those Investments so you can weather  different situations operations that come around   in life but you want to avoid leaving that money  in a bank account because inflation is a thing   and it means that you're essentially losing money  every year so I have a mixture of safe Investments   of riskier Investments that I'm willing to lose  as well start looking at different investment   strategies once you've saved up enough don't leave  any additional money more than you need to in a   bank account I have another video and what you  can be doing with your money in times like the   current recession and I'll link that here for you  as well there's always going to be reasons why   you can't invest because you don't have time you  don't have enough money you don't know where to   start but the longer you put off investing the  harder you will have to work to get that same   may also enjoy another one that I've linked here  on Building Wealth and making money work for you,ACCOUNTANT

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58STtUM-Wow,Josy," In this video we're going to give you a basic overview of how to repair a flat tire on a bike. We'll remove the wheel, replace the inner tube, and put it all back together. Hello, Calvin Johnson here with Park Tool Company. First let's go over the tools and supplies needed. Typical tools and supplies will include wrenches as needed to remove the wheel if any. Tire lever is to remove the tire, a pump or CO2 cartridge to re-inflate the tire, and a spare inner tube. When riding, always try to carry a spare tube if you can. In the event of a flat, replace with the spare, and patch the damaged tube later. Learn how to apply an inner tube patch watch this video. If at any point you need a more detailed look at the process happening on screen, click the more info button. Let's get started. First we need to remove the wheel. If you have rim brakes, it doesn't gaze to brake. This may be a quicker lease lever. A linkage that must be manually disconnected or a button at the brake lever. Now we can move the wheel from the frame. It's time to get the inner tube out of the tire. First deflate the tube completely. Push both sides of the tire towards the center of the rim to loosen the bead from against the rim sidewall. Engage a tire lever between the rim and tire bead. Pull down to lift the bead up and over the rim. Take a second lever, up few inches away, and repeat. Continue to feel the bead loosen enough to run the lever under the tire bead. Remove the second bead from the rim using levers as necessary. The tire and tube are now removed from the wheel. Since we recommend always carrying a spare tube, this video walks through the replacement process. If you're looking to repair or patch your inner tube, watch this video. When servicing a flat tire, always inspect the components of the wheel carefully for tears, damage, and foreign objects. Knowing the cause of the flat can help prevent future flats. In most cases, the cause of a flat will be a small puncture in the tube. If the offending object is still present in the tire, find it and remove it. If there are cuts or ribs that go through the casing of the tire, the tire really needs to be replaced. As the temporary fix, we can use the TB tube tire boot. A small puncture through the tire casing won't compromise the tire. And if a larger cut does not break through the casing, the tire should still be okay. Be sure to squeeze the cut and inspect inside for glass or other sharp objects. Now we install the tube. Unfold the inner tube, but just enough air into the tube for it to hold its shape. Install the tube inside the tire. To make it easier to find when inflating the tire, try to line up the valve stem with the pressure recommendations on the tire sidewall. Check for any directional arrows printed on the sidewalls and align the tire with the rim accordingly. Engage the valve stem into the rim, being sure it is aligned so that it will not be crooked. Work one bead at a time onto the rim. After one bead is installed, begin to push the other bead up and into the rim seat. Only if necessary, use tire levers to finish the bead installation. Work with care not to pinch the tube or you may be repeating the entire process. Inspect the wheel to make sure the bead is uniformly seated and the inner tube is not poking out from underneath the tire. Begin to inflate the tire. Add a little bit of air, then spin the wheel to check how the bead is seating. If the bead rises up in one spot, inflate the tire, push it back down to recede the bead. If the tire dips down in one spot, the bead needs to come up. Here some extra inflation can help, but use care not to blow the tire off the rim. If more air pressure does not pop the bead up, you'll place the tire and use the lubricant in that spot such as soapy water. Inflate the tire to full pressure. Tighten the press to valve stem and install any stem nut and valve cap. The wheel is ready to install. We engage the smallest cog onto the chain. See if the axle into the dropouts entitle appropriately. Be sure to re-engage the brake. Firefly the wheel is centered in the frame and the rotor is centered in the caliper, adjust if necessary. That concludes the process for fixing a flat tire.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPNrtjboISg,Josy," The map of the world is a lot stranger than you think it is, especially this map. You've probably seen it a lot in classrooms or office buildings, but this map is extremely very badly wrong. As we can all hopefully agree upon, the Earth is a sphere, and that means that it is impossible to accurately depict her surface on a two-dimensional map. This particular common map is called the Mercator projection, and if you'd like to experiment with countries for yourself, please go to this website called thetruesize.com after this video. To see what I'm talking about, let's take the US state of Wyoming as an example. Under the assumption that Wyoming is actually a real place and not a land full of tumbleweeds with a population less than downtown Baltimore, this example will work perfectly because of the state's square shape. As we stack one unit of Wyoming on top of each other, we get more and more distorted as we approach the North Pole to the point where we don't even really recognize its familiar boring shape anymore. When we move our Wyoming stack south, they get more squished together as we approach the equator. This will happen with every other landmass in the world, but first, let's take a look at some other US states. They say that everything is bigger in Texas, but what is Texas itself bigger than? Moving the borders over to Europe, the answer may surprise you. Texas is much bigger than Spain and Portugal put together and is also even bigger than France. But Texas is only the second biggest US state behind Alaska, which seems absolutely gargantuan at the top of our map, but while Alaska is large, it isn't that large. Taking down to the US mainland, it compares like this, and taking to Europe, it looks like this. And while we're here in Europe, let's take the time to understand how much bigger Europe seems than what it actually should be. Let's start by taking France and moving it down to Africa to get our first glimpse at this. The United Kingdom seems pretty large as well, but let's take India and move it over to see just how small it really is. The United Kingdom is actually smaller than quite a lot of places in the world that you might not expect. Places like Japan, the Philippines, Sumatra, Madagascar, and New Zealand. Next door to New Zealand is Australia. In the UK, it looks so small just off the east coast in comparison. And Australia, in fact, is much bigger than most people believe it to be. It can be placed to cover almost the entire continental US. Interestingly, the combination of the following countries will not cover that same area. Portugal, the Netherlands, Estonia, Albania, Hungary, Belgium, Bosnia, and Herzegovina, Austria, Croatia, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Serbia, Switzerland, Slovakia, Lithuania, Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, and Norway. And that's not even factoring in big, but not too big, Alaska to the north. Between Alaska and the United States is Canada, which also seems huge up here. And while Canada is a very large country, it's actually roughly the same size as China. But still looks like a colossus when placed in Europe, where it stretches from east to west to Portugal to Iran and up north into the barren sea just above of Russia. Slightly off topic, Japan is another bigger place than most people believe it to be. If Japan were placed off the US East coast, it would look like this in comparison. But much, much bigger than Japan, and also not often thought about as Brazil, which is an absolutely massive country. It doesn't really look like it on our map, but when we move it to Australia, we can actually discover that Brazil is much bigger, which makes Brazil larger than one of the world's seven continents. Brazil is also almost larger than the United States. Spans almost all of Europe, but fits rather snugly into Africa. We are about to discover that Africa is a colossal continent that we don't often realize. It can almost fit the entire contiguous United States into just the Sahara desert, and the continent can also squeeze in China, Western Europe, India, Argentina, Scandinavia, and the UK and still have some room left over. Russia is another place that looks pretty big at the top of the map, but dropped down next to Africa, she also seems much smaller than what our map was telling us beforehand. While we're still here in Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo used to be a colony of Belgium, but Belgium in comparison looks like this. Finally, we need to look at a few other places on the map to the north and the south. Let's start with Sweden, which looks big, but comparing it to Madagascar again, we see that it actually isn't. Iceland also seems like a large island, but it's actually roughly the same size as Tasmania, just south of Australia. And finally, we have the white elephant in the room of Greenland, which towers like a behemoth at the top of the map. Greenland masquerades as being a continent in her own right, looking bare than Australia, South America, and being comparable to North America. But in reality, Greenland is much much smaller. The globe reveals Greenland to be the island that she pretends that she isn't, and we get a much more accurate depiction this time when we compare her to Australia, South America, and North America. And of course, we can't forget about the most shy continent in the world that everybody always forgets about, Antarctica, who spends her time hiding away at the bottom of the map. Most people don't truly have a good understanding of the size of Antarctica, which could probably go either way between being larger or smaller than you think, but the truth is, Antarctica is a huge continent. It is much bigger than Australia. It can stretch all the way from Kiev to Uganda, and incredibly, can be placed between the southernmost tip of Texas in the United States, and stretch all the way into the northernmost islands of Canada. There are many more examples like this, but you've probably understood the point by now. The world is both a bigger place and a smaller place than you previously thought it to be.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H50Azi7mzIs,Josy," Do you enjoy aggressively sacrificing pieces? The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Gambit is made for you. You sacrifice tons of material in the opening. But if successful, you're left with a 72% win rate. You will learn how to sacrifice upon, a knight, and a bishop to build up your Intercontinental Ballistic Missile attack that will lead your opponents position in unorganized chaos and destruction. You can start by playing E4 and if they go D5, you can play knight F3. Now, usually they won't play D5, so if you want to make sure that you can play this opening, you can open with knight F3 and they'll likely go D5. Now you can play E4 and achieve the same position as earlier. They take and you attack upon like this. They intuitively try to defend it with their knight. You offer another pawn and they take it. You take back with the bishop. If you were the black pieces in this position, you'd be annoyed by that knight. Correct? That's why most people play H6. Goodbye knight. Except that it's not good by knight. Take on F7, forking the queen in the rook. At this point, taking the knight seems like the only reasonable thing to do. And now it's over. Bishop to G6, a discovered attack on the queen. At the same time, the king isn't check and forced to do any of these three moves. Every single one of them is shattering. Black takes the bishop and you launch your inner continental ballistic missile attack on the enemy queen. From here on, there's just one mistake that you should avoid. I'll show you what mistake I'm talking about. Winning from this position is very easy. You're upping material. Black's position is completely ruined and you're pressuring many pieces. That's the 72% win rate position I mentioned earlier. Only one thing can go wrong. If Black pushes this pawn, don't take the bishop. Otherwise they can play bishop before, check and discover to attack on your queen. Now you're the fool. If you don't fall for this trap you should be able to win this position by yourself. If not, nobody can help you. But wait, look at this horribly grotesque position. If you're anything like me, this looks amazing to you. This guy right here is holding back three points. They're all isolated and here is another double-plung. Phenomenal. This is actually another outcome of the same gambit. The ICBM gambit in this beautiful piece of disgusting trash are both results of the Tennis and Gambit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWaVN436nw8,Josy," This is how ancient debris generates in Minecraft. As you can see, it is the rarest ore to find in the game. It could take your ages to find enough to make a full matter right here. And besides that, you will also need the smithing template, which is even more rare. But don't you worry, because I will show you 4 ways to find ancient debris for your net right here and how to find the smithing template as fast as possible. Are you ready? Let's break it down. There are 4 ways to find net right. Using bats, mining, using TNT and by raiding bastions. Before we start with these 4 methods, let's look at this graph, where you can see where ancient debris spawns. Technically, it can spawn in every while level of the net. But the chances you will find it above while level 22 is so small that it's a complete waste of time to look for it there. The peak is at Y15 and it equally diminishes going more up and down. That's why Y15 is the best layer to look for an ancient debris. Finding ancient debris can take time, but don't worry, because you actually don't need that much of it. You'll need to smell 4 ancient debris for 1 net right to upgrade 1 item. So, for a full matter right armor, you just need to find 16 ancient debris. And for all your tools, including a hoe, you will need 20. So, to create a full matter right gear, you will need to find 36 ancient debris ors. If that sounds like a lot to you, don't worry, because you will see how easy this can be. Number 1, using bats. The first way to find ancient debris is to use bats. This is because you cannot sleep in the netter, and if you will try to do so, you will regret it soon after your bats exploded. But this is exactly where bats are the best and easiest way to look for ancient debris early game, if you take caution doing it. Just take a stack of wool and a stack of wood with you to craft yourself a lot of bats once you are down there. That's more efficient than coming to the netter with your inventory full of bats. You will also need some slabs, one diamond pickaxe and some food. You think this method could give you up to 30 ancient debris per hour? So, get yourself to Y15, but don't just start digging the tunnel yet. Be aware that you don't mind in the basalt delta by him, because basalt takes forever to mine, and doesn't explode as easy as nettering. Also, make sure that you mine on the chunk border. A chunk is a 16x16 segment of a Minecraft world. The thing is, ancient debris or stand to spawn close to chunk borders. So, mining on a chunk border gives you a higher chance of finding ancient debris. To show chunk borders in Java Edition, just press F3 and G, it's as easy as that. On bad rock edition, chunk borders work the same, but the problem is that you cannot show them like in Java Edition. To know if you are on a chunk border in bad rock edition, go to the 050's or the 1.0's in your world. Or just make sure that you can divide your x and z axis by 16. If so, you are on a chunk border. Now, dig a long tunnel on the chunk border. Then, make branches on the sides of the tunnel, but only on the chunk borders. Now, you could just randomly place and explode bats, but that could cause you a lot of health and it's dangerous. But there is a safe way to use bats easily. First, mine all the blocks in front of you, without mining the orcs in front of your feet. Then, place the bat as far as you can. There should now be a free block gap between you and the bat. Now, place one more block to make that gap for blocks longer and dig one block down. Lastly, place a slab underneath you, like the scobalstone slab. If you now stand on that slab and explode the bat, you will take just minimum damage. Even without armor, you just take one and a half heart damage. With iron armor, you take half a heart damage and with diamond armor, you practically don't even take any damage. And besides that, you didn't have to risk the rig at lava over you or catch fire. Now that the bat is exploded, look around for each of the three blocks. As these blocks are fire and blocks resistant and will stay exposed after the explosion. You can also quench some fires around you because sometimes there is an ancient debris block hiding underneath a flame. But don't spend too much time doing this. When you are done, just continue your pop straight. Dig some blocks into the next wall and repeat this process. Whenever you walk into too much lava, you can turn back to your main tunnel and try a different branch. Number 2, mining. Maybe you think mining for ancient debris is a waste of time, but you would be wrong. It totally depends on the tools you have. You shouldn't use this method early game without any enchantments, because mining all the netherrack would take ages. But this is different if you have an enchanted pickaxe. Mining with the right enchantments could give you 40 ancient debris per hour. The free enchantments you should definitely want to your pickaxe are unbreaking three, mending, and efficiency two or higher. The first two are just so that you will only need one pickaxe. The reason you will only need efficiency level two is because this will break netherrack instantly already, just like an efficiency five pickaxe. But still, the higher, the better, especially when you need to mine blackstone. I think this pickaxe will make it very easy for you to dig tunnels through the netherrack. You should mine like you are some kind of digging machine by mining in circles like this. So you are mining a 4x4 area. As you can see, this goes really fast and you will find ancient debris soon. When your pickaxe needs to be repaired, you can use all the ore blocks on your way, like quartz or a star repair it. Just like with the bad method, make sure that you are mining on a chunkboard to increase your chances to find ancient debris. You can just mine in one straight line until you are bombed with lava. Then you can turn and go different directions on the chunkboard. When you bombed with a lot of gravel, you can choose to just go around it or use a good efficiency shovel to go through it. Number 3. Using TNT. The third method is probably the most efficient method. You use TNT to blow up big areas on the ground. Similar as the bad method, but with TNT, you can keep a safe distance and you can make a chain explosion of as many TNT as you like. Well, more like as many TNT as you can, because even though this is the most efficient method, it's by far also the most expensive one. So you won't be able to do this until you've made yourself a gunpowder farm. But if you have one, this is the best method to use, because it could give you up to 70 agents in debris per hour. Using this method, it's better to dig a tunnel at Y13 or Y14 to lower the chances to get these big lava falls over you. Just dig one long tunnel as long as you like. Make sure that you are mining on a chunkboard to increase your chances to find ancient debris. Then place the TNT. You could place them all in one line, but it's more expensive and unnecessary. The best way to place them is this pattern of 1, skip, 2, skip, 1, skip, 2, skip. This way you get a maximum explosion impact with less TNT. Line up the last TNT and get a safe distance. Once your TNT is exploding, follow the explosions and look for revealed ancient debris ors. But be careful for big lava falls. As you can see, you will find ancient debris spread around this new big tunnel as you made. Now you just have to mine it. But whether you like it or not, you will need to find at least one bastion and raid it if you want to have Naderite gear. Because these are the only places where you can find a smithing template to upgrade your diamond gear into Naderite gear. It might not be the most sustainable way to look for ancient debris, but while you are opening all these chests in these bastions, you have a chance to find ancient debris ors, Naderite scraps, or even Naderite Ignites in these chests. Sometimes even multiple Naderite Ignites in one chest. That chance that you find these various part type of bastion. But I will cover all of that in another video. For now, it's most important to know how to find the smithing template. Bastions are found all over the Nader, except in the basalt delta biome. To find one, you just need to explore the Nader. However, if you find a Nader fortress, there will be no bastion close by. An easy way to explore the Nader is by riding a strider on the lava. Place a saddle on the strider and use a Fungion to stick to riding. When you found the bastion, you need to know that there are 4 types of bastions. Bridges, vocalist tables, hosting units, and the treasure room. You have a 10% chance to find the smithing template when you open any chest. However, there is one chest in a treasure room that has a 100% chance to contain this smithing template. So ideally, you want to find a treasure room bestian. You can easily recognize them by their shape. Two big colossal black boxes and a bridge that connect them with these lava pools underneath it. When you enter the lower box of these two, you can look down and see a lot of gold blocks in one place. In one of these chests there, you will have a guaranteed smithing template. If you didn't find a treasure room bastion, just explore the one you have found in the open chest there. Because you still have a 10% chance to purchase the find one. But if you are a bit lazy, you can use this website called chunkbase.com. You can copy your seed in here, select the version you have, and click on the net of dimension. Here you can see the pickling icons with a chest on it, which are the treasure room bastions close to you. Just check the coordinates and copy it or write it down. For more help with finding which seed you have, check out the description. Bastions are dangerous places, mostly because of the pickling bruise. They will always attack you, no matter what kind of armor you are wearing. They are very strong and can kill you in a few hits. And to make it worse, they will disable your seed for 5 seconds if you try to block their attack. And if you hit them, you will also anger the normal piglets around you. And that can make things even more complicated. So getting to the smithing template could be very challenging. But you can make it a lot easier for yourself, by bringing a bucket of lava with you and one or two stacks of building blocks, like that a rack. Be aware of your surroundings and make sure you have space to pile up. When you see or hear a pickling brood, pile up at least two blocks. And more is safer of course. Make sure it cannot reach you from the side or something. Then just throw your lava bucket on the pickling brood where it's standing. He will slowly die in a lava, but you don't anger the other piglets around you. Just continue doing this and make your way to the chest. You can do all of this easier and safer when you enter from the roof. You make your way down slowly and you will have enough space to pile up if necessary. When you are down there and open the chest, you will anger all the piglets around you. But you can avoid it by placing blocks around you and the chest so the piglets won't see you opening it. In another video, I will show you how to completely raid the bastion. But for now, just take the template and leave carefully. Now you have all your ancient debris and your smithing template. Now you can smell your ancient debris and use the Netaraj caps that come out together with gold to create a Netaraj Ignite. Use the smithing template to upgrade your diamond gear into Netaraj gear, using a Netaraj Ignite and a smithing template. But remember that you only have one template now and you will need to duplicate it for every armor or tool you want to upgrade. To do that, you will need 7 diamonds and another red block. If you need more diamonds, make sure to watch my next video where I show you the fastest ways to find diamonds. Or watch my other videos about finding iron or gold.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUdi0t82lQ8,Josy," Welcome Fellow trivia aficionado. Prepare to be dazzled by these ten mind-blowing and utterly fascinating facts about our incredible world. Buckle up and let's dive in to the realm of knowledge. The Great Wall of China is visible from space, right? Wrong. This famous myth has been busted by astronauts who have confirmed that the wall is not visible to the naked eye from space. It's still an awe-inspiring feat of engineering though. Did you know that the world's oldest known recipe is for beer? Yes, you heard it right. Ancient Samarians brewed beer around 3900 BC and their recipe was etched into a clay tablet. Cheers to our beer-loving ancestors! If you ever find yourself in the serene country of Iceland, don't be surprised if you can't find any mosquitoes buzzing around. Believe it or not, Iceland is one of the few places in the world where mosquitoes are virtually nonexistent. Talk about a mosquito-free paradise! Have you ever wondered why flamingos are pink? Well, it's not because they love strawberry milkshakes. Flamingos get their vibrant pink hue from their diet, which consists of mainly shrimp and algae. The natural pigments in their food give them that fabulous fuchsia color. Let's turn our gaze to the animal kingdom once more. Did you know that a newborn kangaroo is about 1 inch long? Yes, you read that correctly. These adorable marsupials are born extremely tiny and crawl into their mother's pouch to continue growing. It's a snug little start to life. Get ready for a mind-boggling fact about the ocean. The Pacific Ocean is so vast that it covers an area greater than all the Earth's land combined. That's right, all the continents and islands in the world can't compete with the colossal expanse of the Pacific. Time for a sweet revelation. Honey never spoils. Archaeologists have discovered pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. But so if you come across some honey hidden at the back of your pantry, it's probably still good. Ever wondered why the sky appears blue? It's not because you're feeling sad. The blue color of the sky is actually due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight interacts with Earth's atmosphere, it scatters more blue light than any other color, creating the heavenly hue we see. Brace yourself for a fact that will make you go, whoa, Mount Everest. The highest peak on Earth continues to grow taller every year. It's not due to a sudden growth spurt though. The mountain is gradually rising about 0.16 inches each year due to tectonic activity. Talk about reaching for the stars. Finally, let's journey to space for our last fact. The sun is so massive that it contains 99.86% of the mass in our entire solar system. In other words, if the solar system were a pie, the sun would be almost a complete pie, leaving only a tiny slice for all the other planets, moons, and asteroids combined.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dksvHyyI_Vo,Josy," For bad players who are confused about the middle game like you, the London system might be the perfect opening. You can literally play the exact same moves against anything and always end up in a solid position. But chess page 1, beginners should deeply study the opening, rather than learning this setup. That's what you might think. Turns out, you're wrong. Usually, beginners are surprisingly decent in the opening, but don't know what to do in the middle game. So, if you can force your brain to pay attention for 10 minutes now, you'll learn an opening system that you can play against anything. That way you'll have time to finally learn the middle game. Usually I explain openings in missions, but this time it makes much more sense to learn the ideal setup, then the exceptions of that setup, and then we'll look at two example games that'll show you the main attacking ideas. And my next video will be fully dedicated to the middle game. But now let us learn the London system so you can stop worrying about the opening. Pay attention because in 10 minutes you will basically be Magnus Carlson. First of all, let's talk about the setup. Just follow these steps. D4. Then get the bishop out and push upon. But make sure the bishop is already out. Now develop your knight to F3 and your other knight to D2. Complete the pawn pyramid and put your bishop on D3. This is your ideal setup. But there are some things that you have to know. Let's say the game went like this. You still have the same setup. And black pushes C4, attacking your bishop. Your D3 bishop is supposed to attack the king side castle. So it wants to stay in this diagonal. Just drop it back one square, it's still pointing towards the king side. Let's talk about your knight. I'll take these moves back real quick. Black does some normal development move. These two squares are incredibly important. That's why your pawns, bishops and knights mission is to attack on E5. How your horse can jump there, well protected, nice. This is your main attacking idea. Most people capture right away. And you recapture with the plunge. Obviously the knight is under attack and has to retreat, and you play queen h5. Absolutely dominating the king side. I'll show you how to secure the win on the king side with an example game later. This is your ideal attack. It's very common but sometimes things don't go as planned. For example in this position, when you're trying to build your ideal setup, some people go bishop d6, attacking your bishop. Do not trade, they will recapture and you lose all control over E5. Instead, as soon as they offer this trade, just slide your bishop back. And if they take, you recapture. Opening the file for your rook. Now you will have even more control over the king side. And the last thing before we will look at an example game, if they ever play bishop f5. Taking control over this diagonal. Don't let your bishop sit and wait. Immediately challenge the control. But don't initiate the trade. Let them take first and recapture with the queen. Threat neutralized. And now let's take a look at an example game. d4d5. Bishop out. Some black move and d3. The first half of the pawn pyramid. Black develops the knight and white does the same. Now white's next move is to develop the second knight and believe it or not. A common move that you will see everyone's in a wall is bishop before. Tending your knight. Obviously you continue your normal plan, just push c3. The bishop has to retreat. And finally, bishop d3. Your ideal setup is complete. Black castles. White has full control over e5 and perfectly executes the knight attack. Of course black immediately dakes. White recaptures. Attacking the knight. The horse jumps off. Everything is going as planned. And here comes, queen h5. The perfect attack. This would be checkmate. And the most common way to defend it is to push g6. But now you can place your queen very comfortably. The king is silently crying right now. But there's not much to do. So black pushes c5. Hoping to gain an advantage on the queen side. But white plays h4. The attack is rolling. There's no turning back. c4. Drop your bishop back. And knight c5. Oh no, has black discovered a weakness? This week's square is double attacked. Black can position a knight behind our pawn structure. Oh no, anyway. Push the pawn. You have a superior attack. Black positions the knight. Which is kind of annoying because it's blocking your bishop, that way reducing your dominance on the king side. But white takes the l and captures the knight. It's not too bad. Now it's attacking time. White captures. And oh, what is this? The check made in one? The best move is literally to throw the queen in the way. The rook takes it. Now moving the rook like this stops made in one because after the queen captures, the king can go here. Just to be made it anyway. But before you go off and try to play this, obviously your game will not always go as planned. So let's take a look at another example game that shows the most common alternatives. It starts with d4 and now e6. Oh no, a completely different starting move. Well, the good news is, you can play the London anyway. So get your bishop out. And oftentimes what you will see is that they end up playing something like d5 anyway, so it's not even a new position. Push e3, everything is going as planned. But now bishop d6. You probably remember that I told you to drop your bishop back. If you do that, they're likely capture it. Now you can recapture, opening the rook file. Pay attention, if your opponent makes a tiny mistake, he's in big trouble. Just if all you should complete your setup. They castle, you develop your knight and a few moves later your setup is complete, nothing special, you know this by now. By the way if black puts the queen here, please don't blunder your plunge. Use your wife as a human shield to protect the peasants. And if they capture, you have another open rook file. But let's go back. If you have this setup, many beginners and even advanced players fall for a very easy attack. Black makes some normal move, not anticipating the big attack. What you want to do here, is the exact same thing as earlier. You bring your knight to e4. And again, by far the most common move is to capture the knight. But that's a mistake. You take with the plunge. Now this knight is under attack. But this is the very knight that's defending the pawn, which is double attack right now. Black retreats the knight. And now the pawn isn't defended anymore, you can take. Boom, check. The king flees. And here comes the queen. Your very common move for you, you will often play queen h5. And here black decides to go for the counter attack. The pawn is under attack, but a long castle solves the problem. The queen attacks another pawn. But the king moves again. And black pushes the next pawn, committing to the queen side attack. Knight B3, aiming at the queen, hoping that she will retreat. And she actually does retreat. Now white can push more pawns, increasing the king side dominance. It pushes queen side again. And there are many cool moves to play, but our white player finds this one right here. It's actually quite simple. If the king takes it, it's checkmate in one. And if he doesn't take, the queen can take on f7, which is also checkmate. But black finds a move to stop this vicious attack. Rook e7. And white jumps the knight to d4, threatening to take the pawn on c6. That would fork the queen in the rook, a certified by-by moment. It defends the pawn with the rook. In all this chaos, there must be a tactic to win a piece. There must be some way for white to use the high pressure around the king. Let's think hypothetically. If the knight could go to e6, it would fork the king and the queen. Why can't it go to e6? Because e6 is defended by a pawn. Can we get rid of that pawn? Yes. It's sacrifice time. Mr. Bishop I have bad news for you. My plan to victory involves your death. Take the pawn. This is horrible for black. If black doesn't capture the bishop, there's this checkmate pattern, queen g6 and rook h8. So black is forced to take. Allowing the fork. Was this intended? Absolutely not. But did it happen because of our massive king side pressure? Absolutely yes. So are we going to take credit for it and pretend we're brilliant chess players? Absolutely and utterly yes. With the rook now on f7, we can jump to e6. The king has to move. And the knight goes hip-hity hop-ity, your queen is my property. Significantly down in material, the black player decides to take the knight, leaving the rook unprotected. So the queen snacks it. And from here on it's absolute destruction. You will see a few less attempts by black to attack on the queen side. But white is simply stronger. rook h8. The king flees to the only available spot. But now the knight is pinned. So white pushes the pawn, attacking the pin knight. You can't really do anything about it and tries to play on the queen side. White captures the knight and black recaptures. By the way there are multiple force checkmate patterns in this position, but you don't have to always find everything. White just captures a pawn and is still ahead. And black keeps messing around on the queen side. Obviously your game won't go exactly like this, but will summarize your general game plan in a moment. Check. The king runs. Check. The king runs. Check. The king runs. Check. The king runs, out of moves because it's checkmate. So how exactly can you win with the London system? I think the opening is clear at this point. Build your setup and be aware of the few exceptions that I mentioned. But then you enter the middle game. The easy part is over. This is the hard part. Basically there are two factors that will decide if you win or lose. Number 1. The tactics. I can't upload tactical skill into your brain. I'll try to make a helpful video soon. But in the end what matters is that you get practice. Number 2. Your middle game plan. And here I have two aspects for you. Number 1. The quick help. Number 2. The superior help. The quick way to get better is this. Literally move your knight to E5. Wait for them to capture your knight. Take back and bring your queen out. Now keep attacking and maybe you'll find a checkmate at some point. But that's not a middle game strategy. That's just a cool attacking idea. And if the attack fails and you just don't find a cool cheesy attack, you'll sit there with no strategy, not knowing what to do and playing move by move. Why? Because you don't even know what a good move is. Sure you know a fork is a good move, but unless you find a cool tactic, you don't know what a good strategic move is. Like what's the goal here?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAGe8dMUPrQ,Josy," Hey everyone and welcome back to Swift Guitar Lessons. Today I'll give you a quick maintenance lesson on how to change a string on an acoustic guitar. To get the job done we're gonna be using these earthwood, Ernie ball guitar strings, my personal favorite, and also this stringwinder just to get those strings on a little faster. Let's get started. Alright so we got a close look at the guitar. We've all been in this situation before. We've just popped in this case our G string. The first thing I need to do is use my stringwinder. Most of these have little notch here for prying up the bridge pin. So that's the first thing I'm gonna do. Pop up the bridge pin, get underneath there, get a little leverage and then out it comes. Okay so this is definitely a great tool to have. I'm gonna take the old string out and discard it. Get my bridge pin back and I pulled the 22 gauge string out of the Ernie ball earthwood light gauge string set. Okay so I'm gonna pop this new string out. It should only take a couple of minutes to get this together. Grab the ball at the end of the string. I'm gonna drop the ball at the end into the bridge and now the fluid at side of my bridge pin is gonna be facing that string while it's inside the bridge. So I'm just gonna push down and also pull up on the string as I push. See we got it. Alright and that sets nice and easy and we're ready to attach it to the tuner. Okay so now that we have the new string inside the bridge we're ready to remove the old string from the tuner. So we just unwind it and pull it right out. Doesn't usually fight too much. Alright we're ready to get rid of this. We're gonna drag our new string up and through the eye hole of our tuner. Okay so having a string winder is going to make this a lot easier. We're just gonna put it right here on the G string tuner knob and turn it counterclockwise. I'm holding the string down with my left hand. That way it stays nice and top. I want to get a nice tight wind and we want to bend the string across the tuner. That's what we call a notch in. Tighten it up and finally we're ready to cut off the excess and we're good to go. Alright everyone thank you so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video and had a change in acoustic guitar string. I have plenty more videos coming up so keep checking back and please subscribe.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEV8gMkCHXQ,Josy," Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a Style Sheet language famous for making websites look pretty, by default a browser will render HTML as a boring black and white document. CSS allows you to describe the presentation of this markup by modifying the size, color, positioning, and layout of HTML elements. It was first released in 1996 and evolved into CSS3 by 1999. The language continues to evolve to this day with new features, but there will never be a CSS4, just updates to the existing language. The typical CSS rule starts with a selector that can be matched to an element in the HTML document. You then use braces to create a declaration block that contains properties that change the appearance of that element. This is known as a CSS rule, but the tricky thing is that Style Sheets Cascade, a Style Sheet, might contain multiple rules that apply to the same element. This creates a hierarchy, and rules that are more specific will overwrite the rules of their parents. In other words, the order of your CSS rules matter. In addition, some elements will inherit the styles of their parent, but others will not. Ultimately, the browser uses the concepts of Cascade, Specificity, and inheritance to control which styles are applied to an element. To get started, open up a Style tag and any HTML document. A selector can target all HTML elements of a certain type, multiple related elements with a custom class, or a single element with an ID. Now, think of every HTML element like a box. The content is in the middle, followed by padding, border, and a margin. The amount of real estate used by every area in the box can be customized by defining properties like padding and margin. They can take explicit pixel values, or responsive values that are relative to the parent element, or a percentage of the viewport itself. Now these boxes will bump into each other to make up a web page. But you can use tools like Flex Layout and Grid Layout to control how they flow together in a sophisticated way. It can also detect user interaction with pseudo-selectors like hover. CSS also makes it possible to add logic to your code with variables or custom properties, and by making media queries that can apply styles conditionally based on the size or type of device. And it can even handle complex animations with transitions and keyframes. This has been Cascading Style Sheets in 100 seconds.

Also known as a double Windsor or a full Windsor. Start with your collar up in the tie around your neck. If you right-hand it on the wide end in your right hand and the narrow end in your left hand. Now it's important to remember that the longer you make the wide end, the lower the tie will hang when you finished. Basically you want to line up your tie like this. If you remember this you'll save yourself a lot of time later on. Now cross each end over, wide end over the top and leave about this much on the narrow end. That's about four inches or ten centimeters. With your left hand take the wide end, thread it through the back of this opening from behind. Thread it all the way through like this. Now take the wide end and with your left hand, wrap it all the way around the back like this. Switch hands. Notice here how the back of the tie is facing outward. Taking the wide end now in your right hand, thread it through the front of this opening, we're going through the front and down this time. Thread it through all the way down like this. Alright, hardest part's now done. The rest is easy. What you can see here is the inside of your knot. Should look a bit like a triangle. Put your left index finger on the knot like this and keep it there. With your other hand, wrap the wide end around the knot from right to left and then grab it from behind. Keep your index finger where it is. With your right hand, push the wide end through this opening again from the back. So we're coming up and through the back like this. Threading it through the hole. Alright, here comes the punch line. Your index finger has created a little tunnel. What you need to do now is thread the tie down through the tunnel and pull it down. The last step now is to adjust and tighten it. Alternating between the long end and the short end. Gradually pulling the knot up, shaping it as you go until it's just how you want it to be. A sharp, symmetrical, triangular knot. Pull your collar down and bingo! A full, winds of knot. Thank you for watching. I hope you found this helpful.",How to Tie a Tie | Windsor (aka Full Windsor or Double Windsor) | For Beginners,19.07.2015,defragmenteur,man,30s,3:01,10,"0,9958"

Included in 1886 by Dr. Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, and intended as a patent medicine, claiming to provide relief from various ailments Coca-Cola served only 9 drinks per day in its first year of production. Wow, talk about growth! Its two key ingredients were caffeine and cocaine, the letter being removed from the product for a cocaine-free variant in 1903. The name was born from these two items, the Coca-leaf and the Cola nut. It was thought that the repetition of the letter C would capture the consumer's attention, and they were right. Today Coca-Cola's logo and brand is the most recognizable in the world, beating the likes of Google, Nike, McDonald's, and Apple to the top spot. So, what has been the key to success for the carbonated soft drink over the last 137 years? First of all, the recipe or formula for the legendary product remains a closely guarded secret. In fact, a popular myth states that only two executives have access to the formula, with each executive possessing only half of the formula. This precious formula is actually written on paper, and is now secured in a vault at the world of Coca-Cola Museum in Atlanta. Many products have attempted to imitate the taste, but only Pepsi really ever came close. Created at around the same time in 1898, there is an ongoing battle amongst consumers about which drink tastes the best. In terms of sales and branding, Coca-Cola wins every time. In 2020, for example, the company sold around 418 billion liters, while Pepsi only sold 310 billion liters. Coca-Cola generates around 46% of its revenue from the US market, where Pepsi claims around 25%. According to a recent survey by Time magazine, soft drink sales in the US account for around 65 billion US dollars per year. Coca-Cola has long been applauded for its marketing and branding strategies over the years. The iconic polar bears and Santa Claus commercials, countless sport sponsorships from the Olympics and Paralympics to the FIFA World Cup, partnerships with charities from WWF to the American Red Cross. Famous slogans like Coke is it, and share a Coke and its collaborations with some of the world's biggest superstars from Marilyn Monroe to the Braun James. While Coca-Cola's flagship product remains the classic Coca-Cola soda, the brand has evolved to include many other noteworthy products. Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Sprite, Fanta, Powerade, Costa Coffee, Minute Made, and Shwebs to name a few. The company is also on a mission to do its part for the environment with sustainable packaging, the promotion of recycling and maximization of water conservation worldwide. Coca-Cola's rich history, unparalleled success, and warmth towards its consumers have affirmed its domination of the soft drinks industry today and for the foreseeable future.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E39GIysMevQ,Josy," So at some point in their lives, nearly everybody has wanted to dig a hole down to the center of the earth. The only problem is, nobody ever has actually dug a hole down that far. This leads us to the question that this video is all about. If humanity decided that digging a hole was the number one objective of our species, then how deep down could we actually dig with modern day technology? Let's say that we start somewhere on the earth's surface and just start digging from there. Too far down at 1.8 meters and we arrive at the standard grave depth in western culture, so if you are afraid of zombies, this is how far down they'll be coming from. Four meters down and we arrive at the depth that Faro Tutankhamens tomb was discovered at. A little further at 6 meters below the surface, we reach the maximum depth that metal detectors can pick up signals from. At 12 meters, we can find the deepest burrows dug by animals, the Nile crocodile. A little further down at 20 meters and we arrive at the depth of the Paris Catechomes beneath the city of Paris, a tomb that holds the remains of over 6 million people. Double that distance to 40 meters down and we can see the deepest swimming pool in the world. If you drained this pool and jumped into it from the top, it would take nearly 3 seconds before you would hit the bottom. 100 meters down is the usual distance that governments bury their nuclear waste at. To just beneath that, at 105.5 meters down is the deepest metro station in the world, located in Kiev. Moving on to 122 meters down and we see the deepest known point that a plant's roots have ever reached, a fig tree in South Africa. 220 meters down and we arrive at the deepest river in the world, the Congo River in Africa. Beyond that, at 240 meters, you can ride through the deepest railway tunnel in the world that connects the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido. And at 287 meters down, you can drive through the deepest road tunnel in the world in Norway. 305 meters down and you would still be vulnerable to the B82 Earth penetrating nuclear warhead, which can destroy structures up to this depth beneath the surface. Incredibly though, at 392 meters, we arrive at the deepest well and possibly deepest hole ever dug by hand. This is the Wooding Dean Waterwell in the UK and it was dug all the way back in 1862. At 603 meters down, we arrive at something terrifying, the deepest vertical drop inside of a cave. If you were unfortunate enough to be in this cave and fall down this hole, the fall would be higher up than falling from the top of the one world trade center in New York, and the fall would take you over 11 seconds before hitting the bottom. Even further down though at 700 meters is where the Chilean miners were trapped at for 69 days back in 2010. 170 meters down is the deepest hole ever dug that still has an open sky above it, the Bingham Canyon open pit mine in Utah. This pit is so deep that you could place the tallest building in the entire world in the center and still have over 100 more meters to the surface. Much further down at 1400-10 meters though is where the deepest concert ever held happened by the band Agonizer in Finland. 1642 meters down is the depth of the deepest lake on Earth, Lake Baikal in Russia, and 1857 meters down is the deepest part of the Grand Canyon. The deepest known cave on Earth is located 2,197 meters beneath the surface in Georgia, but the deepest hole that you could actually fall into goes way deeper than even this. All the way down at 3132 meters is the bottom of the Moab-Cott song Mind Shaft in South Africa. Taking the elevator takes 4 and a half minutes to reach the bottom, but if you fell into it from the top it would take you 25 seconds for you to hit the bottom and think about what you've just done. Long enough to receive and miss an entire phone call. Even further down at 3600 meters is the deepest point that a multicellular organism has been found alive. This freaky looking worm, but human beings themselves have been even deeper than this. 4,000 meters down is the deepest part of the deepest mine on Earth also located in South Africa. The trip from the surface down to the bottom takes over an hour to complete, and the temperature at the bottom can reach a sweltering 66 degrees Celsius. 6,000 meters is the average depth of the oceanic crust beneath the ocean floor. Way down at 8,848 meters is the height of Mount Everest if it were placed underground instead. 10,994 meters down is the bottom of the Marionus trench which is the deepest part of the ocean. I already covered the depth of the ocean in another video, but unbelievably humans have actually dug down significantly deeper than even this. For reference about what's next, 11,887 meters is the average altitude that a commercial airliner flies at. But deeper than that, at 12,262 meters is the depth of the Kola Superdeep borehole, a project where the Soviet Union attempted to drill all the way through the Earth's crust. They only reached a third of the way there, though, because the temperature at this depth reached 180 degrees Celsius, which was too hot for the drill to continue operating any further. The hole is also only 23 centimeters wide, so luckily you can't accidentally fall into it. If you dropped a quarter down the shaft though, it would take about 50 seconds before it hit the bottom. Recently however, this depth has been surpassed by the Z44 Shavyo oil and gas well, which has drilled down to a depth of 12,376 meters. That's the equivalent of stacking 15 birch caliphas on top of each other, and currently represents the deepest hole that humanity has ever dug. The crust however can extend down to 70,000 meters below the Earth's surface, and the planet's center is located 6,371 kilometers down. If the surface of the Earth is Lisbon Portugal, and the planet's center is Estona Kazakhstan, then humanity so far has just ventured this tiny, insignificant distance.

There are a lot of us that share this planet together, and it's sometimes difficult to understand who everybody is and what everybody believes. To understand things a little better, let's shrink the entire world population down from 7.5 billion people all the way down to just 100 people and keep our small 100% society as similar to the real world as possible. Dividing between gender, the 100% world would be equally divided between 50 men and 50 women. Most of these people would live in Asia, a total of 59 people compared to 16 people living in Africa, 10 living in Europe, 8 in North America, only 6 in South America and just one lonely person living in Australia and Oceania. 11 of these people would be Chinese citizens and another 18 would be Indians. There would be only 4 Americans, 3 Brazilians, 2 Russians and 1 German. The other 53 people would be citizens of 187 other countries around the world. Most of these people would be pretty young, with 9 people aged just between 0 and 4 years old. 17 people would be aged between 5 and 14 years old, and 16 people would be aged between 15 and 24 years old. Another 16 people would be aged between 25 and 34, which means that 58 total people are younger than 35 years old. 20 people would be between 35 and 49, just 14 people would be aged 50 to 64, and only 8 people would be above the age of 65. When we talk about religion in the group of 100, 31 people would adhere to Christianity. 23 would be Muslims. 15 would be Hindus. 7 would be Buddhists. 9 would follow other religions, and 15 people would be non-religious or atheists. Mandarin Chinese is the most understood language with 14 people understanding it, but English isn't far behind it with 13 people understanding it. 9 people understand Hindustani. 8 people understand Spanish, and 5 people understand Arabic, with the other 51 people speaking over 7,000 other languages. Luckily everybody can read and write, with 86 people possessing this ability, but there are still 14 people who are illiterate. 92 people have access to clean and safe drinking water, but 8 people do not, and struggle as a result. 62 people are healthy in their weight, but 11 people are malnourished, and 1 person is literally starving. The other 26 people are overweight, and 8 of those people are actually obese. Only 1 people do not have adequate housing to fully protect themselves from the elements, and 1 person is homeless. The other 78 people however do have proper housing for themselves. Only 60 people have access to toilets though, and the other 40 people do not. Of those 40 people, 15 of them still defecate out in the open outdoors. 54 people live in cities, while the other 46 people live out in the countryside. 99 people are currently unemployed, while the other 91 people either are employed or are outside of the labor force. One of these people has AIDS, and 5 people will be infected by some form of STD this year alone. 58 people are currently married, and the average age that people get married at is 29 for women and 32 for men. Another 15 people actively smoke tobacco products, while the other 85 people do not. Interestingly enough, the same statistic is true of vehicle ownership, with 15 people owning a motor vehicle and another 85 people not owning one. Most people are overwhelmingly right-handed, with only 10 people being left-handed. 73 people have or are expected to graduate from high school, while the other 27 people haven't or are not expected to graduate. However, only 7 people hold a college degree of any kind, while the other 93 people do not. It doesn't stop most people from owning a cell phone. 80 people are in possession of one, while the other 20 people do not have one. This means that yes, more people have access to a cell phone in the world than a toilet. Internet access is also much more uncommon than cell phone ownership, with only 42 people having access to it and the other 58 people not having any access to it. Speaking of the people with internet access however, 26 of them have a Facebook profile, and 14 of them have a YouTube account, and 4 of them use Twitter at least once per month. But perhaps the most shocking difference in our small group of 100 people is the distribution of wealth between them. 71 people have a net worth of under $10,000, and out of them 12 people are living on less than $2 per day. 21 people have a net worth between $10,000 and $100,000, and 7 people have a net worth between $100,000 and $1 million. There is only one person who actually has a net worth above $1 million, but this one person is vastly more wealthy than even this chart makes it appear. This one person owns 50% of all the money in the world. The next 9 people own 35% of all the money in the world, so to recap, 10 people together control 85% of all the money in the society. Other 20 people owns 12% of the global money supply, which means that 70 people, the vast majority of the society, only controls a mere 3% of the money supply. In addition, one person is a refugee or currently displaced from their home, and two people are named Muhammad, which is the most common name in the world currently. Finally, all 100 people currently live on Earth, our home. Within a few years however, who knows how all of this data may be different. So this video was made possible by Hover. I actually just recently bought two new domains with Hover, whataworld.fm for my super secret upcoming podcast series with fellow YouTuber second thought, and real life lore.net so I can finally have my own website.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9n-JNB52rk,Andre,"Hey guys, it's me Cap, formerly Coach of TSM and Wisp. I wanted to make a video about something that really pisses me off and I see all the time. The main examples in this video are from the Orisa-Juno-Brig comp that was popular in Stage 4 and Stage 2 for Korea, but this applies to almost every Overwatch 2 comp, except for a few specific cases. It's about ""getting off the f***ing corner."" What does this mean? It refers to how teams approach turning corners, typically putting their tank at the front with the backline following, which often leaves the backline vulnerable when facing good teams. The enemy tank holds the corner while their backline plays off it, making their backline harder to reach and leading to a trade-off situation that heavily favors them. This mismatch can cause teams to lose fights. Overwatch 2's gameplay boils down to interactions between tanks and backlines, with neutral fights about setup and mid-fights about execution. Whether you're defending or attacking, the key is to position your backline off the corner to avoid being easily punished. For defenders, tanks can hold the corner while backliners maintain sightlines but stay at a safe distance. Attackers need to swing effectively, recognizing when to punish tanks or backliners, while avoiding positions where they can be easily traded. Teams must manage cooldowns and ultimates to bait and punish overextensions, emphasizing positioning and timing over brute aggression. Poor execution, like exposing your backline on the corner, leads to predictable losses. Watching gameplay from the enemy tank's perspective can reveal flaws in positioning. Ultimately, Overwatch 2 requires nuanced decisions about when to engage, bait, or swing around corners effectively, making every fight a test of strategy and execution.",Get off the Corner,11.11.2024,Capitology,Man,20,15:32,10,"-0,9887"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44kByZmKDs,Josy," How to tie your shoes. There are a lot of different ways to tie your shoes. We'll show you the most common way. This will work for either your left or your right shoe. Start by grabbing one lace in each hand about halfway up the lace. Hold them so they make a V. Cross the laces to make an X. One lace will be in front and the other lace is behind it. Take the lace that is behind, pull it over the front and put it through the hole. Now take both ends and pull until the X becomes a V again. The harder you pull, the tighter your shoe gets. Let's spread the V out so we can see it now. Now take one lace at the halfway point and let it hang on your finger. Using your other hand, pinch both sides of the lace so it makes a loop around your finger. Now pull your finger out and you've got an open loop. Hold onto it. With your other hand, take the other lace and lay it over your thumb and finger so that it's in front of the loop. Now you have both laces pointing in the same direction. Use your finger to send that lace back to the other side and now the laces point opposite ways again. Only now you've made a little hole between your shoe and your thumb. See? A little hole. Here's the fun part. Poke the lace through the little hole just a little bit so it makes a loose loop. Now grab both loops at the same time and pull until the knot is tight. You've just tied your shoe. Review those steps a few times until you can remember how to do it. Once you know how to tie the knot, keep practicing. If you practice doing it many times, eventually you'll be able to do it without even looking. See if you can do it like this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MKigAgPZMQ,Josy," Now in this lesson we're going to solve quadratic equations by completing the square. So let's start with this one. x squared plus 4x is equal to 5. So to complete this square, take half of the number in front of x, which is 2, half a 4 is 2, and square it. So we're going to add 2 square to both sides. Whatever you do to left side, you must also do to the right side. Now to factor this expression, x squared plus 4x plus 4, it's going to be x, and then whatever this sign is, plus this number before you square it, x plus 2 squared. If you factor x squared plus 4x plus 4, it's x plus 2 times x plus 2. Two numbers that multiply to 4 and add to 4 is 2 and 2. On the right side, we have 5 plus 2 squared, which is 4, and 5 plus 4 is 9. So now let's solve for the variable x. Let's take the square root of both sides. The square root of x plus 2 squared is x plus 2, and the square root of 9 is plus or minus 3. So now we have two equations. x plus 2 is equal to 3, and x plus 2 is equal to negative 3. So if we subtract both sides by 2, we can see that x is equal to 1. That's one of the answers. And for the other one, if we subtract both sides by 2, negative 3 minus 2 is negative 5. So x is equal to negative 5. Now let's work on another example. Try this one. 2x squared minus 12x. Minus 7 equals 0. Solved by completing the square. So first, I'm going to move the negative 7 to the right side. So 2x squared minus 12x is equal to positive 7. Now notice that there's a 2 in front of x squared. What we need to do is factor off the 2. If we take out 2, it's going to be x squared minus 6x, and then I'm going to leave a space. Now let's complete the square. Half of 6 is 3. And we need to square it. So I've added not just 9 to the left side, but 9 times 2, which is 18. Now whatever you do to the left side, you must also do to the right side. So I have to add positive 18 to the right side. Now to factor, x squared minus 6x plus 3 squared. It's going to be x. Whatever this symbol is minus, this number squared. x squared minus 6x plus 9 is x minus 3 times x minus 3. And then 7 plus 18, that's 25. Now let's divide by 2. So x minus 3 squared is equal to 25 divided by 2. Now we can take the square root of both sides. So on the left, it's just going to be x minus 3. On the right, plus or minus, the square root of 25 is 5. The square root of 2, we'll just leave it as root 2. Now let's rationalize this expression. Let's multiply the top and the bottom by root 2. So x minus 3 is equal to plus or minus 5 root 2 over 2. Now all we can do now is just add 3 to both sides. So x is equal to 3 plus or minus 5 root 2 over 2. Now we can't add 3 and 5 root 2 over 2. We can't add them together. So we're just going to leave it like this. This is the answer. Now keep in mind there's 2 answers. First answer is 3 plus 5 root 2 over 2. And the second answer is 3 minus 5 root 2 over 2. Now let's try another example. 3x squared minus 5x is equal to 10. Solve by completing the square. Now the first thing we're going to do is take out a 3 from the first two terms. 3x squared divided by 3 is x squared. Negative 5x divided by 3. Well it's just going to be negative 5 over 3x. Now we need to take half of this number. Half of 5 over 3 is basically 5 over 6. Multiply it did an omitted by 2. That's how you can find a half of a fraction. And then once we take half of it we need to square it. So it's going to be 5 over 6 squared. Now on the left side we've added 5 over 6 squared but time-stream. So we got to add that to the right side as well. Now how can we factor this expression? Everything you need you can see it. It's going to be x and then whatever this sign is minus. This number before you square it 5 over 6 squared. It's always going to work out that way. On the right we have a 10 plus 3. 5 squared is 25. 6 squared is 36. Now let's combine this first. 3 over 36. If we divide 36 by 3 we're going to get 12. So this is the same as 25 over 12. Plus 10 over 1. Now let's combine 10 over 1 and 25 over 12. To do that we need to get common denominators. Let's multiply this by 12 over 12. So that becomes 120 over 12. 120 plus 25 is 145 over 12. Now what we need to do is get rid of this tree. So we're going to multiply both sides by 1 third. On the left side 3 and 1 third will cancel. On the right side we might be able to reduce a few things. Well it turns out that 145 is knocked invisible by 3. So we can't reduce that. So let's multiply 12 times 3 which is 36. Now let's take the square root of both sides. We can't really simplify the square root of 145. So we just have to leave it the way it is. But the square root of 36 is 6. And this is going to be plus or minus. All we can do is now add this fraction to this side. So the final answer, x is equal to 5 over 6 plus or minus root 145. That's a terrible 5. The divided by 6. So this is the answer. If you want you can write it like this too as a single fraction. Since we have the same denominator. 5 plus or minus root 145 over 6. You can leave it like that if you want to.",Solving Quadratic Equations By Completing The Square,19.01.2018,The Organic Chemistry Tutor,Man,30s,7:57,10,"0,6003"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f53nXHoMXx4,Josy," So, today we will find out about the chi-square test and how it is used to find out whether two variables, two given variables are related or not. Now, first of all we need to find out what is our aim, why are we using the test. So, that can be stated like this. Suppose, this particular question, you can look at this table. In this table we have two variables. One represents the education qualification of a person and the other represents the marital status of a person whether he is unmarried, married, divorced or widowed. Now, what are aim is our aim is to calculate or state whether the two variables, the education qualification and the marital status are these related to each other or they have no relation with each other. One of the other thing. So, first of all we start with defining our null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis. Our null hypothesis can be stated that there is no correlation between the two variables and the alternate hypothesis can be stated by saying that there is significant relation between the two variables. Now, significant, the significance level is to be defined. The significant level either it can be taken as 0.05 which is 5 percent deviation from bean or we can say 0.01. Usually, the significance level is taken as 0.05. There are different significance levels taken for different type of observations. But generally, the significance level is taken as 5 percent that is 0.05. So, we will go with that. Now, how to start? Now, first of all we will look at the observation values, the values which are observed or which have been taken from the field. So, these are called as observed values. Now, we prepare another table for the same variables, but those values will be calculated values or you can see the expected values. Now, how to calculate it? Now, in this table, you can see there are 36 people who are unmarried and whose education is high school. Now, for those people, the expected value could be the row total into the column total divided by the grand total. There are 300 people whose data is been collected. So, that is called as the grand total. So, that comes out to be 27. In the same way, for the first element that is 18, there are 18 people who are unmarried and whose education is middle school. The expected value will be 90 into 39 divided by 300. That will give you 11.7. In the same way, we need to calculate the expected value for all the categories and the table which will get like this. This will be the table for the expected values and the first one was the table for the observed values. Now, our aim is to find out how much deviation is there between the two given values. That is found out by a simple formula that is observed minus the expected value, the whole square upon the expected value. So, we prepare another table which states the difference between the two variables, which states the difference between the two values. Now, we will look at this table now. Here you can see the table contains different values. The table contains the observed value, the expected value, the difference between the two values, the square of the difference between the two values and divided by the expected value. So, we will fill out this table. The first value there was 18 and the observed value was 18. The expected values 11.7. So, 18, 11.7, the difference, the square and we divided by the expected value that is 11.7, what I get is 639.69 and once I divided by E, I get 3, I get as 3.39. Now, in the same way, we need to calculate all the given values, the difference between the expected and the observed values and I get this table completed. And once I complete this table, you can see the total of this last column that is the observed value minus the expected value, the whole square upon the expected value. This value is called as the value of the chi square. Now, this value is the calculated chi square. We also need to compare this value with the tabular value of chi square. Now, how is that calculated? Now, for tabular value, I need to find out the degrees of freedom. Now, degrees of freedom is found out by a simple way. You can see in the original question, there were five columns, five different categories for the level of education and there were four different categories for the medical status. So, the degrees of freedom is calculated by 5 minus 1 into 4 minus 1 that comes out to be 12. So, 12, we need to see the table for the, we need to see this table for the tabular value of chi square and we can see the tabular value of chi square for the degrees of freedom that is 12 and the significance level 0.05 that comes out to be 21.03. Now, once you get this value, we can compare the calculated value and the observed value. We can see the tabular value is smaller than the calculated value. So, in chi square whenever the calculated value is greater than the tabular value or the critical value, then we can state that our null hypothesis is rejected and the alternate hypothesis is accepted. Now, what was our alternate hypothesis? It was that there is a significance relation between the two variables, between the marital status and the level of education. So, this is how we use the chi square test to state whether the two variables are related or not. So, we can see the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the",Chi Square test,16.12.2019,Vectors Academy,Man,30s,7:16,,"0,9997"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv9maM7pwgA,Wentao ,"In the golden age of classical Athens, the average citizen had exactly two fears: the war with Sparta, and talking with Socrates. The Spartans at least were outside the city walls, but that wily Socrates was even more terrifying because he could be anywhere. You might be at a party for elite Athenians, walking through the Agora marketplace, or even waiting in line to be put on trial, but as soon as you smelled Socrates coming you knew you were in trouble. Then once he stepped barefoot into your line of sight and heard you so much as thinking, this disheveled goblin of a man would delight in dissecting every aspect of your conscience, question by question. Why do you hold your opinions, are you doing enough to be a good person, are you qualified to know what Goodness even means? In the eyes of the Athenian public, Socrates was a vulture scavenging the city for errant ideas, ready to dive on any offhand comments or boasts of wisdom. Socrates was, by all accounts, profoundly irritating to political bigwigs and self-proclaimed “experts”, but he was undeniably an upright citizen, having served in the Athenian army on three occasions and holding a deep respect for the laws of the city, and the boisterous Athenian youths absolutely loved the guy. Among that bunch, none was more devoted than his student Plato. Born to an aristocratic family in the mid 420s BC, Plato grew up among the leading political elite during the height of the Peloponnesian War, whereupon he bravely ditched any chance of a career in business or politics to instead study Philosophy. My hero. Around 387 BC, Plato founded an informal academy on his family estate where Athenians could freely gather to discuss and debate topics from the most ethical and practical to the abstract and theoretical. Plato’s Academy inspired other philosophical schools across Greece, such as the Lykeion of his student Aristotle, and it remained in use until its untimely destruction in the 80s BC – Long story, blame the Romans. Yet, like many a frustrated Athenian citizen, Plato could never escape Socrates, and Plato’s greatest philosophical legacy lies in his Socratic Dialogues, a collection of 30-odd philosophical discussions featuring his beloved mentor. These are not the first written works of philosophy, nor the first to ask big questions about the nature of the world and our place in it – but Plato’s approach is so thoroughly systematic and wide-ranging in its treatment of ethics, politics, epistemology, and abstract concepts that we can rightly credit Plato with creating The analytical toolkit of Western Philosophy, elevating it from a field of casual inquiry to a defined system of investigation. In short, the man is good, but more than anything else, it’s the dynamic between Socrates and Plato which makes these dialogues so darn captivating. To see how, as kánoume philosophía! Now, Plato had studied with Socrates for at least a decade before striking out on his own, and the instigating factor was Socrates dying. Because being a compulsive conversationalist wasn’t a crime in ancient Athens, and neither was being annoying, but Socrates was such a profound pain in the ass that three Athenians brought him up on charges of impiety and corrupting the youth in the hopes of getting him exiled or killed. And Socrates was so stubborn it worked perfectly! They held a trial, he told them to piss off, they sentenced him to death, he drank the poison, and simple as that, he’s on a boat to the river Styx! And after that rather traumatic experience, Plato’s outlet for grief and at least a little rage was writing, codifying the memory of his mentor through the activity he’d loved most, dialogue. At the time (and basically ever since), Philosophy was usually written as a treatise, where the author talks at you, but Plato instead adapted Athens’ local style of theatrical drama. The dialogue format was certainly new and unique, but it’s really a philosophy play, so it made perfect sense as a distinctly Athenian mode of philosophy, as well as a Socratic one. It also helps solve the issue of Socrates’ complete disdain for writing. He loved to talk, but thought that an idea dies as soon as it hits the papyrus. Writing is static, it can’t converse, it can’t react – but usefully: it also can’t drink poison, so Plato was willing to do it anyway. And by writing dialogues instead of treatises, Plato upheld the Socratic ideal of lively debate, and, in some cases, preserved actual discussions Socrates likely had. Among the earliest and most famous of Plato’s dialogues are the Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito, which depict the trial and imprisonment of Socrates, leading to his death in the latter Phaedo dialogue. These are a small slice of Plato’s total work, but they offer the most dramatic portrayal of Socrates’ character, and combine into the foundational narrative that all the other dialogues build on. So, what does Plato show us? The first dialogue in the series sees Socrates awaiting his trial outside the law court, where he meets a man named Euthyphro who’s prosecuting his own father for killing a murderer; he knows this is bold of him, but he considers it the pious thing to do. So Socrates asks “what is piety really?” and Euthyphro offers some ideas, but Socrates keeps finding problems, so they end up going in a circle without landing on a solid answer. Critically, Socrates isn’t being a mean-spirited contrarian, but genuinely wants to find an answer and is willing to defy conventional ideas to get at deeper truths. But the dialogue also asks how Athenians have any right to accuse Socrates of impiety when they themselves can’t even define it. This leads right into the Apology, which is not apologetic in the slightest but rather comes from the Greek word for Speaking in Defense. Here we listen to Socrates’ arguments for his innocence against the crimes of impiety and corrupting the youth, as well as a general defense for his philosophical questioning that the Athenians are actually upset about. He compares himself to a gadfly biting a lazy horse: an annoying presence that’s necessary to stimulate the Athenians to be better, and declares that even if acquitted he’ll never stop asking questions of people because the unexamined life is not worth living (38a5–6). After his defense, the 501-man jury finds him guilty, and this triggers a fascinating step in the Athenian legal process. After a guilty verdict, the prosecution and the defense each propose a punishment, and the jury votes once again. This encourages moderation, so when the prosecution proposed death, the assumption was Socrates would request exile and most likely get it, but instead he doubled down, saying if you want to know what I Deserve, I’ll tell you what I deserve. Put me up in the Prytaneion and give me free meals for life, because I’m doing Athens a service and that’s what I deserve… Naturally, the jury voted for death, but Socrates remained undaunted. The beauty of the language in the Apology is Plato’s gift, but that unshakable moral core was all Socrates – And that attitude pervades the next two dialogues. Now, the day before Socrates’ trial, a ship left port for a sacred festival on the island of Delos, and until it came back no executions were allowed to take place, so Socrates stayed in prison for a month, until his friend Crito arrives to tell him the ship was spotted off the coast of Sounion and would be back in the city soon after. Crito offers Socrates one last chance to escape but Socrates refuses on principle. Sure, the guards couldn’t care less if he bolted so long as he just left the city, but justice is justice and Socrates would rather die. In the next dialogue, he sure as hell does. The Phaedo portrays the last conversation with his students about the immortality of the soul before the sun sets and he drinks the poison Hemlock. The death is immaculately dramatized, as his friends swing between laughing and weeping while Socrates remains calm, serene, and pious to the very end. This is the stuff religions are made of, but Plato leverages the drama of it all to better explore those topics of piety, justice, and death his characters investigate. Now, we have an interesting problem here, because Socrates is all aboard the immortal soul train in the Phaedo, but earlier in the Apology he explicitly does not know what happens to him after he dies. And that gets to The Big Question in Platonic philosophy: Where does the historical Socrates end and Plato’s character of Socrates begin? The simplest answer is chronological, as Plato’s early dialogues hew much closer to how other sources paint the historical Socrates and have more basis in actual conversations – while the later dialogues see Plato get more inventive, developing Socrates into a character that he can drop in any story and set loose. Early dialogues often have plausible context or full historical precedent like the trial, but middle dialogues like the Republic create whole scenarios and characters for Socrates to bounce off of. We can also distinguish the dialogues by what Socrates is doing in them. The early dialogues typically follow a format of some smartypants declaring that they know something about politics, religion, ethics or the like, whereupon Socrates exercises carte blanche to ruin this person’s whole career, systematically skewering their positions and leaving them as a confused blubbering mess before carrying happily along with his day. This is the Socrates who Athens wanted dead. However, the middle and late dialogues show Socrates offering ideas for a change, possibly in line with Plato developing his ideas and delicately weaving them into the texts. Socrates in the latter dialogues takes a more rigorously mathematical approach and has more interest in abstract concepts. He still operates through lines of questioning, but we can clearly see Plato’s hand in this version of the character. Looking at the structure of the Republic, book 1 reads as a standard early dialogue, investigating the question of justice and ending with no clear answer, but in book 2 Socrates puts forward his own definition, using the metaphor of a city’s government to illustrate how justice works in a single person, and this discussion drives the subsequent nine books of the Republic. After several tangents and extra philosophical scaffolding to support the main argument, the metaphor falls apart, but several key ideas make it through intact – most significant being the theory of Forms, the intangible ideals and concepts that govern the universe. These forms are reflected down into mathematics, the physical world, and then images. So this drawing of Blue is an image of me, who is an image of humanity, which is itself an image of the concept of Life. This is where we glimpse Plato’s own philosophy; he never states it outright, because he also believes that philosophy is a process rather than a singular truth, but he gives Socrates more and more ideas that survive scrutiny and convince other characters in the dialogues. Those ideas, taken on their own, form an entire corpus of thought that’s gone on to inspire secular philosophy and Abrahamic theology for millennia. That all is plenty impressive, but it’s not why Plato is the best philosopher. See, the dialogue format isn’t just a cute recreation of Socrates’ antics or a clever riff on Athenian theater, it’s the only way to convey philosophy that meets the Socratic ideal. Plato recognized that text becomes fixed and static once it’s written, so his strategy is to make the reader participate with him and Socrates and the other characters. When the Euthyphro ends without an answer on what piety is, that invites the reader to use what they’ve learned and try their own hand at it – so that dialogue continues in our minds, millennia after Plato took his hand off the papyrus. The dialogues leave open questions, so as long as the text is read, the conversation remains alive as we craft our own answers. With the possible exception of Jewish philosophy in the Midrashic tradition, which is a beautiful communal exploration of the Torah unfolding over generations, almost no other western philosopher does this! Plato’s distinctly Athenian innovation is the best mode to convey philosophy, and I’m baffled that this isn’t the main way we do this! The craft of discussion and the process of investigating our ideas through questions gets us a greater understanding of real-world and theoretical truths. If we read a regular old treatise and just take an author’s word for it, we’re only coming at the idea from one angle, which then leaves some rhetorical flank exposed for someone like Socrates to rip it apart, but when we use the Socratic method to challenge our ideas, reconfigure and strengthen them, that’s when we approach real wisdom. Now go read a dialogue and start asking some questions! Thank you so much for watching! I first thought of doing this video last summer when I was re-reading the Euthyphro and thought “wait, this is, like, really really good???” There are plenty of other Platonic gems I didn’t get to cover, like the Protagoras and the Gorgias, but maybe that just means you should go read them for yourself and see what I’m on about. Oh no, what a shame, you just HAVE to go read Plato now, agh, damn, sorry, [laughing] –  anyway I’ll see you in the next one.",History-Makers: Plato,09.06.2023,Overly Sarcastic Productions,Man,20s,11:02,10,"0,9993"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntKTXdVlbV0,Wentao,[Music] I want to talk just briefly about this third eye center business because it turns out to be pretty interesting the third eye is actually a name that's been given to another neural structure um or I should say structure because it's not strictly neural and that's the pineal gland this has an interesting history I promise I'm not taking off on a tangent here that isn't relevant to meditation so you have a brain of course and on both sides of your brain you tend to have mirror symmetric representations of the same things what do I mean by that well you have a prefrontal cortex on the right you have a prefrontal cortex on the left and they actually do slightly different things language is sometimes lateralized to one side but in general for every structure that you have on one side of the brain you have the same structure on the opposite side of the brain there's one clear exception to that and that's the pineal gland the pineal gland is the gland that makes melatonin which at night when it gets dark secretes melatonin and that melatonin makes you sleepy it helps you fall asleep but not stay asleep Descartes right the philosopher Descartes asserted that the pineal was the seat of the Soul because it was the one structure in the brain that he saw was not on both sides of the brain it was only one of them and in the middle now I don't know if it's the seed of the Soul or not I'm not in a position to make assessments like that but what do we know about the pineal the pineal as I mentioned is involved in releasing melatonin it does a few other things as well but it is also considered the third eye for a couple of reasons one is that it responds to light although in humans not directly so in birds and lizards and snakes they actually either have a thin skull or believe it or not two holes in the top of their skull that allow light to go directly in if you look at the head of a snake light can go directly into their brain through these holes and activate the pineal to suppress melatonin and control their wakefulness sleep rhythms in Birds they don't have holes in their skull but they have very thin skulls and believe it or not light can penetrate the thinness of those of the skull and many birds and communicates information about time of day and even time of year and that's translating to hormonal signals such as melatonin release from the pineal and so the pineal has been called the third eye because it's a light sensitive organ inside the brain in humans the pineal sits deep deep to the surface and light cannot get in there in fact if light can get into your brain unless you are part of a specific experiment where that's the intention or you're having neurosurgery or something of that sort then you've got serious issues happening that pineal sits deep deep near What's called the fourth ventricle and it absolutely should not see light directly so the idea that the pineal is the third eye in humans is not true it just isn't true so anytime someone says oh the pineal is your third eye that's not the third eye center that people are referring to when they talk about meditation now you'll see a number of different um forms of art where somebody will uh it will be a picture of a face and the eyes will be closed or sometimes open they'll be literally a third eye like a cyclops eye in the middle of the forehead that has been proposed for many thousands of years to be quote unquote the seat of our Consciousness now that's interesting because that real estate behind the forehead actually turns out to be the prefrontal cortex which we know from lesion studies and stimulation studies if you remove that brain area people become very reflexive they are not thinking intentionally they don't become deliberate in fact and this is kind of an eerie result but if you inactivate you turn off the prefrontal cortex and you give somebody the opportunity to play a shooting game for instance their accuracy goes through the roof they become essentially like a machine they see a stimulus they shoot at they see a stimulus they shoot at it their accuracy is exceptional but their ability to distinguish between enemy and friend completely disappears so they become a highly effective motor or I should say sensory motor machine but their assessment and their judgment about right or wrong completely disappears this is also true for people that have prefrontal damage they often will have inappropriate behavior or hard time suppressing behaviors Etc so the third eye center as the seat of Consciousness and Our intention is something that makes sense generally with what we know about the Neuroscience in neurology but there's something more to it that I think is especially important for all of you that goes beyond anything about ancient Traditions or pineals or birds or snakes and pits in the top of the head and here's what it is the brain itself meaning the brain tissue does not have any Sensory neurons what do I mean by that well if I touch the top of my hand I can feel that if I want to sense my heartbeat if I work at it I can feel that if I want to sense how I feel internally at the level of my stomach is it full is it empty am I hungry is it acidic it does it ache or does it feel Pleasant Etc I can sense that and that's because we have Sensory neurons on our skin and in our body Etc we also have Sensory neurons in our eyes that let us perceive things externally we have no Sensory neurons on our brain this is one of the reasons why you can remove the skull and do brain surgery on somebody who's wide awake and be poking around in there and they don't need any anesthetic on the brain itself they need anesthetic for the incision site but they don't need anesthetic on the brain because it has no feeling you have emotions but there's no feeling so normally we are perceiving and paying attention to what we are sensing either externally sights and sounds again exteroception or internally interoception touch Etc but by focusing our perception or in and our attention not on our bodily surface like a body scan but to a point a couple centimeters or inches behind our forehead we essentially are bringing that attentional that perceptual Spotlight to a location in which there is no sensation there's nothing to feel there and when we do that by closing our eyes and focusing on that quote unquote Third Eye Center which is the prefrontal cortex to be quite honest when we do that something else happens and what happens is when we are not thinking about and perceiving our Sensations because there are none there our thoughts and our emotions and our memories sort of mushroom up they more a better way to put it would be that they geyser up and take on more prominence in our perception what I mean by this is that normally you know I'm not thinking about the contact point between me and this chair but as I'm speaking I'm in contact with the chair and those neurons are firing but if I focus my energy and attention on them they're going to fire the same but more of my perception goes there similarly I'm thinking things all the time you are too and I'm perceiving things all the time and I'm remembering things all the time and I'm anticipating things all the time about the future but by focusing my attention on the one organ for which I have no sensation that is my brain well then thoughts feelings and memories feelings meaning emotional feelings start to grow in their prominence in my awareness and in my perception and so this is why when you sit down to a meditative practice if it's a meditative practice where you close your eyes or you're focused on that third eye center where you're focused on your brain as opposed to your bodily surface or something external to you the thoughts seem to come by in waves and they can almost be overwhelming it's very hard to as it's often described just sit back and watch your thoughts go by because there are so many of them actually the best way to stop thinking is to really focus on something external or to focus on sensation that's less thinking than it is perceiving senses okay so I don't want this to get too abstract when people talk about the third eye center they're not talking about the pineal they're talking about prefrontal cortex and when you direct your own attention to the very area of your brain that directs attention there's nothing to sense there the only things that will become present to you are feelings emotions that is thoughts and memories and they will often arrive in what seems to be a very disorganized fashion and the reason they arrive in somewhat disorganized fashion is because normally we just don't perceive things that way normally we are splitting our Attention our perception that is to multiple things our sensation and our thoughts when we put all of our perception into our thoughts we see how disorganized how wondering they are and how in fact how random and intrusive those can be again random and intrusive and much of what we talked about in that paper earlier the one where they ask people what are you doing and what are you feeling and how happy or how unhappy are you are what they discovered was that most people are sort of in their head a lot they're not really present to what they're doing which leads me to the statement that I believe at least based on the data that paper included that most people have an interreceptive bias they're focused more on what's going on internally than they are focused on what's Happening externally there are certainly people who for the opposite is true but I think that this is an issue because we hear so often about the need to do a meditation practice that allows us to focus Inward and that we're going to yank around by all the stressors of Life etc etc and we are we're getting yanked around by all the stressors and demands of life but as we do that we tend to be very focused on what's happening with us the data clearly points to the fact that being Mindful and being aware can enhance one's level of presence and happiness but we can go so far as to say that being Mindful and aware of what's Happening not just with us but external to us in our immediate environment that includes what other people are saying and doing that also can really enhance our sense of well-being and happiness at least that's what the data point to ,Opening Your Third Eye?!

in the 12th century mathematician and astronomer Bhaskar - wrote the Siddhanta shadow money which contained texts in astronomy with proofs using calculus he proved the added size point the instantaneous speed of a planet is zero actually I don't know what that means but that's what it literally says in this paragraph of a news article in a language you don't care about and this paragraph talks about how some English mathematicians called Newton and Leibniz are known for this discovery even though Basquiat said it a few centuries earlier one of the greatest mathematicians and astronomers in the 14th century India madhava linked the idea of infinite series with geometry and trigonometry he was able to formulate infinite series expansions for sine cosine arctan and even pi so you see these expansions here you know the one that we call the power series expansions but nope they're actually called them out of a series this is the mod of a sine series is the model of a cosine series and this is them although arc tangent series but if he did find this then why didn't mother but get the credit himself we can't find his work the only sources were the mathematicians who reference him Newton and Leibnitz and other Western mathematicians were 300 years too late the history of calculus and mathematics isn't straightforward different countries came up with their own methods around the same time using this knowledge we attribute its flourishing as a promising field to the people who tied it all together Newton was a physics buff his calculus was defined out of necessity to lay the foundations of gravitation and the laws of motion so it's no surprise that he thought of calculus in terms of motion and called his calculus the method of fluxions a variable of interest was called the fluent and it's velocity was called the flexin while Newton thought of his calculus in terms of motion Leibnitz had a more mathematical interpretation to him calculus was more sums of infinitesimal distances the same meaning behind the notation we use today and so most of the notation we use is actually from Leibnitz so who took the credit for calculus Newton conceived his ideas in the 1660s while Leibnitz came to similar conclusions a decade later but Lena's published his findings nearly a decade before Newton well initially it was Newton but after their deaths both were attributed the title inventors of calculus regardless as we've seen calculus wasn't invented overnight it's a branch in mathematics that has multiple roots from thousands of years ago and it continues to power newer fields like machine learning and AI if not for all these people some of us would be doing different things hope you guys like this little tension from the hardcore math videos I've been dishing out lately subscribe for more content on data Sciences and I will see you in the next one ,History of Calculus -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEB9s-5jaoY,Wentao,sit down look a little bit forlorn hydra microphone bro you don't even have a microphone this is so cringy okay futurism let's talk about it okay so what is futurist cooking all right to give a quick rundown of things peaches cooking was something coined by marionetti in the 1900s as a way to revitalize eating as some sort of performance art or culture practice he did so by including gastronomy music sense into the mix to creative absolute original or innovative practice however this came at a cost the abolition of pasta to marionetty pasta was heavy nationalistic and patriotic it also disrupted the equilibrium the consumer since it was something that swallowed not masticated so it wasn't ideal however though this movement wasn't some sort of long-term trending thing we still see remnants of it in current cuisine might not be 100 italian but let's look into it today i bring to you okay so the word messi is derived from the word which is short for italian and messi which means meal and japanese so this is a genre of japanese italian fusion dishes but if you look at some of these recipes are on this recipe site some of them are not exactly made with italian ingredients like the first one which means simple curry fried rice taste italian dish this one which is a spaghetti dish that's based off of the italian spaghetti with napoli sauce looking at these recipes though some of them are made with japanese ingredients or ingredients that might not be seen on a traditional italian dish or at least for this one would be which is uh onion or ketchup which is ketchup which i assume that is part of the tomato based sauce that they're using but they also do have italian elements in the dish like shiro wine which is something that's used in the original napoli sauce so does itameshi actually carry remnants of that futures cooking culture that we're looking for that was my task for today and with a friend we went on a quest to a japanese italian restaurant in search of a new gastronomic [Music] long as you're experience with me to be drunk and in love in new york city i like me better [Music] before we could grab the table we ended up looking at their menu and there were a lot of japanese italian pasta dishes and some japanese and italian and tea pastel uh [Music] [Music] i like me better when i'm with you when i'm with you for real okay so what do you think about the food today it's your question i thought the food was really good because i really enjoy pasta i definitely think it's more japanese style because compared to the other pastas i've had before this one is a lot more sweeter the moment we walked into the restaurant itself they can tell by the mural you can tell it's gonna be fusion but like but they did try to put like all the volcanoes in that barbie stanford like it made it seem like was more italian but asian i guess in that sense the atmosphere itself was pretty loud yeah it was definitely it doesn't feel more welcoming to talk though like just to enter and be able to chat with your friends just because they're so loud not that i was also kind of asian the way that they put the appetizer and a house at the same time because usually with course meals they usually put the appetizer in first in front of your person you kind of split it and eat it but then this time they just put the appetizer and the pasta yeah the minute it's ready to serve to you yeah i think mine you know i guess like squinting itself it's already pretty asian to use that kind of style dish and these shirazu and shrimp in there so that definitely gave it to asian styles first and they also have that post jack on top too oh were they yeah there's a question in there actually speaking that b-roll it was interesting how the fact that they gave us chopsticks instead of forks to use why do you think it's so popular i know it's like definitely altered for an asian palette in general is probably catered towards the more globalized but that appetizer though but that was actually very italian though it tasted it felt really italian too even in um when i visited japan before when i went to italian restaurants in japan obviously like the staff are japanese and like the restaurant and the whole culture is japanese but they wouldn't serve they didn't serve that dish we had a prosciutto pretty much i feel like out of the entire experience that we had that in itself is already like pretty italian i would like not say pretty italian but they're their attempt of making everything italian style that's true especially with olives so this experience does it actually relate to futurist cooking well if you search at the definition of futurist cooking in the dictionary i don't expect you to find it mischievous in the definition i mean ita misty dishes are mostly pasta dishes which is already a big no-no in futurist cooking but i do think that it was a new gastronomic experience well a key concept in futures cooking is the concept of renewal the futures wanted to make italy a light modern country so basically something that could compete on the global stage i mean japanese italian relations aren't something new either like we see in fantozzi where he takes the secretary out to dinner now one episode it was filmed in a japanese restaurant in a way that would have gotten a lot of backlash in the current time that particular episode also showed a lot of adversity to foreign food like the raw fish causing indigestion or the particular way the japanese threatened fantozia and the secretary when they want to dissipate the restaurant rules on leave i also think that this is a concept that we should take into consideration when we talk about itamesi but rather than the clashing civilizations that we see in pantozi i would say that italian food has morphed through movement migration and exchanging ideas into this genre of japanese italian dishes that we see nowadays so that in itself had become a new gastronomical experience where surprise japanese ingredients have altered the taste of italian pasta dishes giving it a new sensuous feel using chopsticks at the restaurant also allowed us to consume the food more slowly and savor it more and this has also appealed to a globalized audience as well because the dishes aren't as heavy as they used to be but in conclusion itameshi isn't exactly futurist cooking but it does contain elements that contribute towards the future's agenda and their new innovative pasta dishes also act as a foil to counteract the reasons why that the future is disliked pasta all right so that's it for today don't forget to drop a like comment and subscribe just kidding but i'll see you next time bye oh

Of course if you play League of Legends and you get hit by Shogaf Q, you're actually boosted at the game. Shogaf Q is the hardest ability to hit in the entire game. We have the skillshot. Or maybe we'll say an ult actually. We say an ult is hardest one. Say an ult is the only ability in the game that boooooooom when you use it. So alert every enemy on the game that you're coming. Maybe we should say an ult is hardest. He's ult because 100. Bring down the storm! And the dive potential is ridiculous because you have insane damage and you have sustain. And then you can disable towers with the ultimate. That is just you just diving your opponents, okay. That's what you do. You are the messy of League, you dive dead. In AP Voli, that's always what you're gonna play. When you play lane Voli Baron, you're always gonna go AP. Important to keep your pass above. It is really key for your damage.

You need a handbread or 200 AP on Volley Bear. That is so that you have wave clear. Health is the best stat on Volley Bear because of your W. Your W becomes overpowered with health.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYyMIafWQXg,Mark," In my previous Noitavideo, I showed the gigantic project that I'm working on, the big alchemy lab that I'm building in order to house all of the materials in the game so that I can then experiment with them all. Just to keep you updated a little bit with that, we've actually made a lot of really good progress, discovering some cool things, and obtaining almost all of the materials that we know are obtainable. There are really only a few left that I have not yet obtained. But anyway, this video is not really about that. Don't worry, I will be making another video going over all of the materials and all of the crazy alchemy. However, during the course of this process over the last six months or so, we have discovered some new and interesting bugs that are related to the amount of time you're in a run for. What exactly breaks when you do super long runs like this? There is something absolutely crazy that happens if you do a very, very, very long run. So yeah, this is just going to be a really short video just showing you new things we learned about what breaks when you do a long run. I first want to thank Dexter CD, who not only discovered the thing you see on the thumbnail, which I'll show you a little bit later, but I gave him my save file when I noticed something going wrong and he ripped it apart. In order to find out exactly what was going on with all of these systems that I'm going to show you that broke. So thank you very much Dexter. Let's go. Liquids in Noita have a special jiggle animation on them to help differentiate them from other types of materials like powders. But if you have a long run going over 72 hours, something might look a little bit off with that animation. It actually starts jiggling twice as fast as normal between 72 hours and 145 hours. What happens after 145 hours? This. This is what all of my liquids look like. There's no jiggle at all. The jiggle animation just completely breaks if you have a run going over 145 hours. This isn't a problem. It's just the animation. It's not the physics of the material itself, but you could be tricked into thinking that the game crashed at times because if you're just sitting still in a pool of liquid and there's no animation at all, you just have this still screen. It actually tricked me a few times. But other than that, there's nothing major. It's just the animation or the lack of one anyway. It just makes things look ugly and like the liquids are made out of gel or something. Anyway, as opposed to that, this one is a little bit more serious or just annoying because if you do a run longer than 145 hours, telekinetic kick breaks and you can no longer control physics objects. You can kick them away and that's the extent of your control. So in my big alchemy run, telekinetic kick is actually an important perk for me since I'm interacting with all the secrets in the game and a lot of those secrets involve moving things like physics objects up to the mountain altar. Unfortunate, but there's nothing I can do about it. Also, as I was just showing, I'm not sure if this is related to the amount of time in a run or this is some other bug I encountered. But this is what the water drops should look like at the beginning of a run. In my run, the entirety of the mines are flooded because as you can see, it seems like the entity that drips the water has been duped somehow, maybe multiple times. So I just have just eventually the whole world is gonna get flooded. However, this is something maybe you didn't know. There are actually invisible entities up here that spawn the water droplets and those entities have HP and can be killed. So at any time, if I'm sick of my world getting flooded, I can always just come up here and kill these things. The next small, purely visual bug at 145 hours, any ones that you have not yet purchased or picked up from item pedestals, they lose their bobbing up and down animation. Again, just a small bug, purely visual, but I wanted to cover everything that I noticed, so there you go. Next is another purely visual bug, but the stars in the sky stop blinking when you hit 145 hours, which we recently learned you might not have any stars in the sky if you've never died in the game. Because stars spawn as you die, but it does hit a maximum number eventually, so you can't just fill the entire sky with just one big star. The next bug affects the luky legs, all the spider legs in the game. In the most extreme case, all of my mecha colmi's throughout every parallel world have completely lost their legs and their ability to move, so my mecha colmi is literally a ball, a stationary ball, or a little guy. But why did these bugs happen at 145 hours? Well, to simplify that explanation, basically, Noita has a frame counter and a separate time-played value. The frame counter is an integer, but the time-played value is a float, and floating point isn't perfect. The further the value gets from zero, the less precise it is. So basically what happens, once that value reaches 524,288, it actually rounds down to zero, and then the value is frozen from that point on. And since the value is frozen, a bunch of things break in the game. There's more stuff that breaks, such as parts of the inventory and levitation component of the player, but I haven't yet observed what exactly happens. It might just be very, very minimal. Alright, and now it's time for the bug of all bugs. Probably one of the most interesting video game bugs ever. If, and this is a big if, if, you can possibly have a run-going for 9,942 hours, the entire world, every solid surface, and object, everything, becomes lightning. If you have electricity immunity, you can walk along this without getting stunned every two seconds and then dying. However, soon after, your movement just completely breaks. You become spaghettified in a way. Unless of course you're stained with teleportation, then you can still teleport around the world. He's witnessing the destruction of everything. And yes, I did, of course, try to end the game while the world was in this state, and as you can see, the gold vein did still get created. Any new materials that I created are still going to get created, but then if they break, then become physics objects or powders, then they will become electricity afterwards or lightning. And yes, of course, of course, guys, of course I also tried sitting inside the cauldron when this happened. This is maybe the alter of permanence after all. What's more permanent than staying inside the cauldron for 9,942 hours? I mean, yeah, I didn't stay there for the whole time, but yeah, of course, I sat inside the cauldron and died via electricity. And as you can see in the end, that screen, the time that this happens, 9,942 hours, exactly. But why exactly does this happen? Why does the world at 9,942 hours become electricity? Well, in the wise words of Dexter, the lightning happens once the frame counter nearly reaches 2 to the 31st minus 1. It actually happens 1,000 frames before that. The reason why it does this is because a cell's electricity charge in the game is stored relative to the frame so for example, if a cell should receive a charge of 2,000, the game will say frame underscore counter plus 2,000 inside the cell. So as frames increase by 1, the charge decreases by 1. However, once the frame counter is near 2 to the 31st minus 1, the result of that addition is a very large negative number instead of a positive number. So this will be true for nearly everything, i.e. everything becomes lightning. Or basically the frame counter overflows and since lightning is relative to frame count, everything becomes electrified until the frame counter overflows once again in another 9,942 hours and that number becomes positive once again. So yes, the world becomes lightning because the frame counter overflows and becomes a large negative number for 9,942 hours. So I mean, if you want to do a run that's nearly 20,000 hours long, be my guest. As sort of a stretch goal in my alchemy run, I am going to see if it's possible to have that run going for 9,942 hours so that I can have this happen legitimately in that run. Hopefully by then, I get all of the experiments finished that I plan. I know Twitch chat. You guys are like, when are you going to do this? Just be patient. We got plenty of time and if you guys want to join the Twitch chat, I am streaming every session of this alchemy run over at twitch.tv slash fury forged. Anyway, if we discover anything else crazy like this, I will let you know. And then once again, after I conduct many more experiments and learn a lot more, we have a long road ahead of us, I will 100% be putting out a gigantic video on all of the alchemy, all of the materials, all of the reactions, all of the knowledge gained by doing this pretty huge endeavor. Until then, thank you very much for watching. I hope that you found this interesting and the races on. Who will have a 10,000 hour run first? If the game updates, then we all get to start over. Anyway, all right, see you.",Side-effects of doing VERY long runs in Noita,20.09.2024,FuryForged,Man,20s,10:24,,"0,9973"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kipu8QhojY,Mark," Mojang have recently been experimenting with the way that Minecraft Redstone works. Changes to the way that Minecraft Redstone updates have made new things possible, but also some old things impossible, but generally speaking, these changes only really affect the cutting edge of Redstone contraptions. At least, that's what I thought. On December 24th, 2012, I released my magnum opus. This incredibly simple, hidden crafting bench system. But as you can see, in the latest version, it does not work. This Redstone Duster used to cause an update to this piston, making it realize it was powered, causing it to extend, but that no longer happens. And this briefly ruined my week. And I say briefly because I placed a block here, and then the machine started working. And you may think, well, that makes sense because now obviously the Redstone is powering the piston. But look a little bit closer. The Redstone is powering the piston. There isn't extended. I'm now starting to understand why people have troubles with Redstone. Certain bits are completely illogical. This whole system relies entirely on this block. This piston is currently being powered by this block. This Redstone unpowering is what updates this piston to tell it it should be powered. And then this Redstone powering on is what's telling this piston that this block is now unpowered. Why this block makes a difference? In the latest update, I actually don't really know. And it does mean that now if you cause an update to this piston, then it does actually break the contraption because this piston realizes that it's being powered over here. However, if I manage to make two Redstone components and two pistons confusing, for the first time ever, things were not really quite simple. And so begins my quest to continually improve the hidden crafting bench. I genuinely think I can actually make this thing smaller. It will be a little bit more expensive, but I think I can get the footprint to fit within the space created by these pistons. It's going to rely on the same logic, but it's going to use a slightly different system. You see, when I designed this, the observer didn't even exist in the game, but I think... This should work. There it is. Okay, I've managed to make it smaller. And the way that this functions actually makes sense, even if it doesn't look like it does. So effectively, still the same thing is going on. This piston is being powered by this block in the center, but the update telling the piston to extend is caused by this note block, and then this observer sending a Redstone signal into the piston. That is why there is a small amount of delay before it extends. So if you imagine you've got your wall, but kind of in the backroom storage system here, if we stand on this, and on this, we can stand off it and everything gets hidden away. Contrary to what many people believe, you don't often hide a crafting bench because you don't want people using your crafting bench. You hide a crafting bench because crafting benches don't fit in with the vibe of a lot of builds. Okay, what if I wanted to stack my hidden crafting benches up next to one another? Well, this is going to require a complete redesign of how my hidden crafting bench works, which... I mean, it's a pretty good little design. If we make it so that it's powered from the back, that means that we can tile them up next to one another, and then because pistons take a little while to extend, but retract instantly, that should do everything that we need to make a hidden crafting bench. Okay, then I can run a Redstone line down the back, and when I flick this lever, all of our useful blocks pop out of the ground. I gotta say that looks really, really cool, and then when I flick this lever again, everything gets hidden away nice and simple. But now I think about it. If all of them are activating together, it could just be one circuit on the side with Redstone lines connecting up all the pistons. Okay, let's quickly do that, and that... That all seems to be working pretty nicely. Gosh, does this Redstone contraption make sense? This makes so much sense. But what if I don't want them all to pop out at once? What if I say once I access just my fledgling table? No, no, you're thinking surely, you know, you've got this system right here. I mean, these are independent of one another, right? No. No. No, because this block right here, well, it also powers this piston and this piston as well, and it breaks everything. So let's try our best to do something about that. You know, I am really getting the swing of things now, and I feel like I have a good idea. I think something just like this. Yes. Okay. So if I just want to pop out my crafting bench, bam, I can do that. If I just want my fledgling table, flick that one, that's fine. I can then put my crafting bench away, and I can whip out this thing. My goodness, you could even put some observers on top and have copper bulbs. Okay, I couldn't help myself. I had to decorate this one. Look at this space-age build. The crafting benches and smithing tables and things would not fit in this area. This is the correct way to do it. Come on now. This is so cool. I want one of these in my actual house. I forget minecraft. I want this. And the pressure plates are definitely a nice touch, but I wonder if there's a way that I can make this button operate it. Okay. Now, T-flip flop inside of a hidden crafting bench. Thankfully, we do have the copper bulbs, which are like built in T-flip flops. And it's a bit of a chunky one. But it does work. And this, again, this makes a lot of sense. It's not using any weirdness. That's very cool. Very nice. But it's being powered from the side, isn't it? In fact, to be honest, when you're not actually hiding your crafting bench to hide it, it's purely for decoration purposes. I mean, I feel like the lever should be in a better position than this. Okay, let's briefly go back to levers and see if we can change the input position again. What I really want is I want our input to be directly above where our crafting bench pops out. Gosh, this is actually going to come out. Actually, no. What I take that back, I think I have an idea on how to do it. Yes, yeah, this is going to be easy. This is... breezy. Yes. So it's the same as this design over here. Right, inside I've got this little circuit on top, which is just causing an update to an observer, which is causing this piston to spit out his block, which is allowing us to turn our hidden crafting bench on and off. And because it is based on this system over here, it means that we can stack these things up next to another. This is a gift that keeps on giving. I think we can all agree that this is an incredibly satisfying little redstone contraption. 2012 me would not have believed his little teenage eyes. That also 2012 me would have probably taken issue with these levers. I did not like levers at the time. I wanted everything to be buttoned, operated, and that is still the case. So let's fix that. Again, I'm just going to base the design on this one over here. I just need to get a teaflit flop to fit in this space. Hopper... Bold is kind of out of the question. But I guess it isn't? No, no, it isn't. No, this works. This is working really nicely. Or if we wanted to mix things up and make it slightly cheaper, you could do this with mangrove routes, but I think the great looks cooler. And you could probably do something like this. Oh, I do kind of like having water in redstone contraptions. What an incredibly satisfying little redstone build this is. I'm actually going to decorate the thing. Look at this. How cool is this? I want to build this immediately on the Hermitcraft server. There is no need for this build to exist, but equally I want it a lot. But I guess as decorative and as beautiful as this thing is, it's not really hiding anything anymore. It's just more making a nice decorative feature of a redstone contraption. What if we genuinely wanted to hide away our grafting benches? I'll then attaching a redstone torch key to it could be the moose. Okay, let's have a think about this. So this is our floor level, and then yeah, our torch key device needs to be activated there. Because I'd like it to activate on the block that is going to pop up. What happens here? That actually works. And that's a really small redstone torch key accidentally came up with a new design. Excellent. Word then attaching something like this to it work. Oh my goodness, yes. That's pretty ridiculous, okay. That is really, really cool. So if you bit, we've got a little hidden area here, but if I place down a redstone torch, then emergency fletching table pops up out of the ground. Oh my goodness, I just managed to make it even smaller. I just managed to make it even smaller. This is stupid. So there we have it. We've kind of got one for everyone there. Builds there as simple as possible. We've got multi-swappers. We've got individual swappers. We've got button-operated ones. Leaver-operated ones. Button-operated from above ones. And even hidden ones. Your crafting benches are now in safe hands. And successfully hidden. If you enjoyed, now catch you in the next one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9c8oZ49pFc,Mark," Where is the darkest part of a shadow? I mean the obvious answer seems to be right in the middle. If you look closely at a shadow, as you move the object away from the wall, you'll notice that the shadow gets a bit fuzzy, so clearly the edges are lighter. Now we know that light bends around corners, that's a phenomenon called diffraction. So is it diffraction that's responsible for the fuzzy edges of shadows? Actually, no. The reason that shadows have fuzzy edges is because most light sources, like the sun, are not perfectly point objects. So light from one edge of the sun is coming in at a very slightly different angle from light from the other edge of the sun, and that's what gives us these fuzzy edges. It's not diffraction. But diffraction can play a significant role in shadows, and in fact it was the cause of a massive debate about 200 years ago. In 1818, the French Academy sponsored a competition to try to find the best explanation of diffraction. In Augustine Frenel entered this competition with the suggestion that light is a wave phenomenon, and just like any ordinary wave, it bends as it passes around an obstacle. But one of the judges was Simeon Poisson, a harsh critic of the wave theory. He much preferred Newton's idea that light was a stream of particles, and to show just how ridiculous the wave theory was, he showed that Frenel's theory would predict a bright spot in the shadow, right in the middle of the shadow behind a circular object. There would be a spot almost as bright as if the object wasn't there at all. And he thought this was absurd, but my question is, does it exist? Is the brightest part of a shadow really in the middle? To find out, we're going to have to do the experiment. So first I had to find some circular obstacles. I selected spheres instead. I got some marbles and some small spherical magnets. Then for a powerful light source and a large distance to the screen, I selected a lecture theater with a projector. Now the first thing we're going to need is a small aperture for the light to pass through. So I'm going to poke a hole in this card with screw. It's important to have a small aperture because you want the light to be in phase. And that should work if it's all coming out of this small little aperture. But when I put a sphere in front of it, all right, I'm going to hit the lights. Here we go. I can't see a bright spot. I can't really see anything. So next I tried a cell phone flashlight putting a marble in front of that. And again, I could see nothing. I don't see anything in the middle. The idea with Poisson's spot is that light should diffract around a circular object or a sphere. And because the center of the shadow is equidistant from all the edges of that obstacle, all of the light should constructively interfere at that point creating that bright spot. So next I tried an overhead projector. I tried a string of the small spherical magnets. It's weird. I feel like I can see it. Do you think you can see a bright spot in the middle of the bottom one? No. No? I feel like in the very center of each one, I can see a bright spot. Oh. I don't know. My eyes are just totally going nuts up here. Like staring at shadows and trying to see what we want. But this one is opaque. It's nice and spherical. Set it down. And if I adjust the focus, you can see there's a bright spot right in the middle of that marble. So the spot looks pretty good, but something about it didn't sit right with me. And you know, when you think something is true, you really should try as hard as you can to disprove it. What if you used your fingers to kind of make the edges less spherical? Yeah. You know, that's that I think is concerning. The fact that we can still see a bit of spot even though it looks like you're... Right? How is the light getting through and getting there? What was really happening was light was coming up from the base of this overhead projector. Bouncing off this lens back onto the top of the marble and then back up through this lens and onto the wall. So finally, I decided to use a laser. I resisted doing this earlier because in 1818, they didn't have lasers. In fact, Poisson didn't do the experiment. He didn't think that you needed to. The idea of a bright spot in the middle of a shadow was just so ridiculous. And for now, didn't do the experiment either. But one of the other judges, by the name of Erigo, decided to actually do the experiment. And when he did it, he saw something similar to what I saw. So here, I was using the laser through a diverging lens. And then that beam was shone onto a marble resting on top of a loop of tape. So you can see on the wall basically exactly what you'd expect just a shadow of the marble. But when you turn the lights off, there it is. A bright spot right in the middle of that shadow. So the brightest part of a shadow is in the middle, as long as it's the shadow of a circular or spherical object. Now this spot is sometimes called Erigo's spot because he did the experiment and found it. Sometimes it's called for Nell's bright spot because it was his theory. But pretty frequently, it's referred to as Poisson's spot. Harsh reminder that it's not only your great achievements, but also your greatest mistakes. That can be named after you. We don't see Poisson's spot in our day to day lives. For many reasons, one of which is that most objects are not perfect circles. Plus, if they have any surface roughness really at all, that will completely wash out Poisson's spot. And finally, most light sources are not coherent. That is, the waves are not coming all in phase, peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs. So you might think you could never see Poisson's spot under ordinary conditions, but you can. What you need to do is look at a diffuse source of bright light, like a fluorescent tube or the blue sky. You should see some small light specs drifting around your visual field. Now those are caused by floaters. Little particles actually drifting around inside your eyeball. They can be all sorts of different shapes, but some of them are spheres. And so they cast a shadow on the back of your retina, and right in the middle of that shadow is Poisson's bright spot. And that is what demonstrated that light really is a wave phenomenon. And you don't even have to take my word for it. You can see it with your very own eyes.",The Brightest Part of a Shadow is in the Middle,14.10.2015,Veritasium,Man,30s,7:20,,"0,9979"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0,Mark," What is light? What is light? What is light? What is light? That's a good question, isn't it? What is light? Isn't it an element? Light is brightness, I guess. We have auras. Wheel hub or something? Which are light? Yes, they are. It lights up the room, it makes it not dark. What's the difference between blue light and red light? The color. In your eyes and then you see stuff. They range from white to red to orange to green. It's like the trackers of your body. Can you see my aura? No, not particularly right now. Is it too bright out? It's very sunny out here today. Does that make it harder to see someone's aura? Not necessarily. If I was to explain it to a blind person, right? It would be the difference you see nothing whatsoever as a blind person. Whereas I see things in front of me. To be fair, the question of what light is is not an easy one. For centuries, the greatest minds in science debated this issue. In the late 1600s, Newton proposed that light was a stream of particles or corpuscles. He proposed this in his treaties optics. But at the same time, a Dutch physicist named Hoigens proposed that light was a wave. And this debate raged on until it was settled by the experiment I've recreated today. Thomas Young's double slit experiment. To make sure I got the experiment right, I went to the original source. With the help of Brady Haren, I managed to get into the vault underneath the Royal Society in London. Where is it? There I found Thomas Young's handwritten notes from 1803. I brought into the sunbeam a slip of a card, about one-thirty-th of an inch. In wreath. And observed it's shadow. Either on the wall or on other cards held at different distances. Besides the fringes of colors on each side of the shadow, the shadow itself was divided by similar parallel fringes and small dimensions. Wow. This is an experiment so simple that you could make it at home, and yet so fiddly that I have never seen it before done with sunlight. I was thinking about doing it in a box, like a fridge box. And you could take it out on the street. Taking it out on the street. Could I possibly interview you guys for about a minute? We're doing a science experiment. I have here is an empty box. And this is a little eyepiece where we can look in. And this is a hole. And I'm going to place this slide above that hole. And if you look closely, you'll see that there's two openings. Very narrow opening side by side. It's a double slip. Now before we have a look, we need to tilt it towards the sun a little bit. So we want the sun to hit this double slip directly. What are we going to see on the bottom of the box? You think you're going to see, you're going to see two lines. Two lines on the bottom of the box. Two bright banks. Two little lines. I think it'll be one line for two. I could expect you to see the whole box lit up. It'll probably be a kaleidoscope of some sort. A bunch of colours. Probably here. Rainbows, different colours. There, have a look. You expected to see kind of one line. Is that what you see? No. I see dots. How many? It's one circle. There's one in the middle strongest. Two either side. The two on the outside are multi-colored. And the one on the middle is just white. And kind of a rainbow? The rainbow colour as well. Quite a few colours. And lots of little dots. There are more dots appearing. I think I can even see more dots spreading along. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, I can see tons of dots. No. Not tons, but I can see dots spreading. Of course that way. Yeah, definitely. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, that's incredible. And that's just nothing else apart from two slits. Two slits. What kind of one? That's incredible. But all we're doing is we're putting a light through two very narrow slits side by side. So how does this make any sense? There's some kind of principle involved in it. But the average person is not familiar with it. That's the only explanation. No, I'm really confused by it, but I'd like to find out why. People were debating is light a wave or is it made of particles? So what causes that? Well, if light were behaving as particles, you would expect them to go through each slit and just produce a bright spot underneath. So we would see two bright spots on the bottom of the box. But if light's behaving as waves, then the wave from one slit can interact with the waves from the other slit. I've got a demonstration here on a little pond where we can see this with water waves. I have two sources of ripples, which are basically like the two slits. When I create ripples with a single source, they travel out with circular wave fronts. Nothing particularly surprising there. But if I add a second source of ripples, then we start getting an interesting pattern. This pattern is created by the ripples from the two sources interacting with each other. Where they meet up peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs, the amplitude of the wave is increased. That's what we call constructive interference. But if the peak from one wave meets up with the trough from the other, then we get destructive interference, and there's basically no wave there. And this is exactly what was happening with the light. When the light from one slit met up, peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs, they constructively interfered and produced a bright spot. But if the trough from the wave from one slit met up with the peak of the wave from the other slit, they would destructively interfere and you wouldn't see any light there. It's light cancelling itself out. This is basically the same as having two drops of water fall in a swing pool. Exactly the same. As this ripple overlaps with those ripples, down the bottom, you get a series of, you get a bright spot, and then a dark spot, and then a bright spot, and then a dark spot. There's a slight complication, which is that sunlight is composed of many different colors, and they have different wavelengths. So obviously they're going to meet up at slightly different points. And that's what caused the rain-bowing effects as we go further from the central maximum. You saw the ones to the right were slightly colored. Yeah, it's that kind of marking. The reds are going to meet up at different places than the blues. And that's all that makes the color difference is the different wavelengths. Exactly. That's amazing. So the difference between reds and reds? So the reds are going to be over there and the green part is just, I'm seeing that. It's a different wavelength. And that's how we bring in all these beautiful colors all around us. Exactly. That's amazing. I'm an amazing. Oh, get on you, thanks very much. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm Jason Lawson. Listen to me. Now you may have noticed in that experiment that the light on the bottom of the box was not in the shape of slits. Rather they were more kind of round blobs. And I want to know why that is. Can you write an answer for me in the comment section? And I'll give you a hint. One of the videos I've linked kind of suggestive of the answer. So convincing were the results of Young's double-slit experiment that the scientific community concluded that light must be a wave. There is no way it could be a particle.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKE97l30B4Y,Wentao,Western Civilization has contributed more than any other to the development of human learning people all over the world emulate our University Systems our scientific methods they use theories originally developed in the west as the foundations for their own scientific research and yet Western kind has lost faith in itself and become deracinated from our own intellectual roots we bought into the narratives critiquing our civilization coming from our professorial class as a consequence we have simply forgotten the actual intellectual foundations that allowed for the ascendancy of our people we unlocked the secrets of nature we discovered the principles of the physical world and harness the forces of nature not through through some violent revolution against the Western intellectual tradition Galileo Kepler cernus these people saw themselves as firmly in line with the Pythagorean platonic lineage of philosophers they drew inspiration from the Ancients the philosophical naturalists that are popular today would like to affect a kind of reset on intellectual life it's sufficient for us to Tinker around conduct experiments think for ourselves using modern Common Sense we can throw out metaphysics who cares that the platonic oratian worldview gave coherence to Western intellectual life for more than two Millennia inconsequential we can just trust the science and figure it out in our lab coats it's ridiculous obviously the intellectual tradition matters it is why we're here it's why we were the ones to reach the moon we were the ones to split the atom if we are going to set our civilization back on course we have to take ownership of that intellectual tradition no one else will learn it for you and if our generation lets it slip then it just won't be a living tradition anymore the scientific material s will have won out and I think will have suffered a great loss intellectually and also I think as a people I don't see how we could survive without being Tethered to the source that made us great not that it's all on Plato of course Plato was in his own tradition of philosophers he was a Pythagorean in his own right and Pythagoras didn't invent his philosophy he drew inspiration from the Ancients of his day days lately online I've been teaching platonic philosophy running reading groups doing texts of Plato Aristotle the neoplatonists I've been using the eblan curriculum over the last couple years and that was of course developed by the neoplatonic philosopher yamus all of the schools of antiquity merged into the neoplatonic school of late Antiquity so stoicism aristotelianism platonism it was all brought together the other schools basically died out so for the last few centuries of the ancient world neoplatonism was philosophy and they developed this curriculum for initiating students into the philosophical tradition I think we need to go back to our intellectual roots and we should actually use the curriculum that the Ancients used and then build from there if you want to understand Christian Scholastic philosophy you better understand neoplatonism because that's where it came from when the Byzantine Empire absorbed the formerly Pagan schools at Athens and Alexandria they adopted their curriculum they adopted their philosophical Concepts and categories Christian scholasticism is a continuation from Hagen neoplatonism it also has plenty of insights neoplatonic philosophy on modern-day scientific problems there are people who identify as neoplatonists in the modern day like Michael Levan making breakthroughs in biology or John Veri coming up with a viable theory of relevance realization and of course Roger Penrose there are plenty of modern-day platonists it's still a workable school of thought it's just not in line with the mainstream scientific material ISM and it is hard to get into and then of course you have our own adversaries on acts and so forth who fall in line with a kind of straussian platonism they value the ancient texts but they don't read them in the traditional way they read them through a modern lens they too would just drop all of the metaphysics stuff and look at it as some kind of commentary on The Human Condition or something like that no the metaphysics matters the theology matters being connected to the Divine matters in concepts of the political and we have all of the documents we need from the ancient world to get back into their mentality the Ancients understood Plato better than modern people modern Scholars can accomplish an awful lot and there are some great modern Scholars of platonism like uh Lloyd Gerson out of the University of Toronto it is up to us to learn this stuff I am going to be resetting the eblan curriculum this is the only chance if you want to get in on the reading groups from the start this will be oriented towards total beginners in philosophy platonic philosophy and so we will do two sessions a week we're starting in a couple weeks so sign up I'll provide links in the description where you can sign up I'm using a course software this time I'm going to post quizzes and course materials uh but you can also still sign up at patreon.com AOL for 10 bucks a month that'll get you access two sessions a week Fridays 3 p.m. central Time we'll do readings of the texts with commentary and then Saturdays 10:00 a.m. Central we'll do a lecture and Q&A a so this would be the time to join if you want to discuss with others or be able to ask questions as you go um I think it is the best way to reconnect ourselves with our tradition you can't just start with the Scholastics because they assume this prior philosophical Heritage you have to start with the Ancients the beginning of it is Plato and there was an ancient way of teaching Playdoh that we can simply use we're actually going to start with a unit on Pythagoras uh Pythagoras is a very interesting character most people don't know too much about him he had a cult or something and taught in a cave uh there are a lot more details than that that we do know that we can get into uh immensely significant in the history of ideas it was Pythagorean mathematizing of Natural Science really that was the move that led to Western ascendancy and the rest of the world has really not caught up since then the Arab world for a little while but that's because they had access to the Greek ancient texts while the West Was severed from the tradition we now have a clearer view than people did even a hundred years ago of our own intellectual uh Heritage as a people so we should take advantage of that there are excellent modern commentaries available we're going to go through a ton of texts and this group is going to be going for quite a while so I encourage you sign up for that even if you probably won't consistently participate consider just supporting I do need the support to be able to do this otherwise I may just have to go back to work I am hosting students now if you want to come down and stay here while doing the Aman curriculum we'll also do bonus inperson material that won't be online um contact me directly you can message me on telegram AOL a a RV o l l so um that's it the curriculum is restarting I think it will be of value to you um and also we're going to be doing it together it'll be a social thing so it should be fun thanks for listening thanks for considering God bless [Music] ,The Iamblichean Curriculum,23.11.2024,Aarvoll,Man,30s,09:41,8,"0,999"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3uaHgN4b-4&t=34s,Wentao,so you read a little NY it's all peachy you go online ignore everyone getting screechy watch some vids and you see people talking discreetly about nichan ethics the creation of values re-evaluation of morals or transvaluation but no one seems to be giving any real examples and everyone seems to have different ideas on the how why and what the results would look like no one seems to have the concept packaged neatly little do they all know there is a really good example of creating your own values or trans valuation as given in the story of dun there is a scene in the first book where Paul is confronted with a dilemma he has proven himself as a warrior and a worm Rider to proceed forward he is expected to kill sgar in fact to kill sgar would be just and honorable by freman Norms so what is he to do not killing him is Unthinkable by freman standards and yet where no one else can see a path he forges a new one by not killing sgar and having him remain in his position of authority he isn't just making a political play by inserting a new rank above SI leader he is literally unbinding himself from the morals customs and traditions of a people and showing them a new ethos now you may say yeah but isn't Paul superhuman isn't he the quizat hyak yes true but he has attributes that we ourselves can cultivate to a certain degree specifically prence prience is forethought or foresight this relates mythically to both Prometheus and certain Gnostic sects that use forth thought as the name of a being that descends and AIDS Sophia in her Fallen State and in some Greek myths Prometheus wields an axe which he uses to Aid in the birthing of Athena wisdom from the head of Zeus wisdom knowing forethought or foresight are all intimately connected but how do we cultivate these things within us and in what way does this grant us the agency to transv valuate our lives well let's add a little GFF to the equation gergy burgie has a system called the work later dubbed the fourth way which relates a simple technique simply called self-observation basically you are practicing a type of detached watching on yourself while going about daily living you're not actually trying to change anything you do per se you are merely watching your being's reactions to Impressions while you are in the world the data you collect through self-observation is categorized in three ways that is reactions or Impressions or functions that relate to one the intellect two the emotions or three motor instincts what one begins to notice through prolonged self-observation is that we humans are like machines just like how when you put a specific input into a computer to get a specific output we humans if we are given specific Impressions or Sensations will always react to it in the same way every time by continuing self-observation we begin to not only know notice all of these outputs or functions But realize they are interl example you notice via self-observation that A peculiar string of thoughts are in your mind you realize that these thoughts have Arisen from a particular emotional state that emotional state only arose once you were sitting in a particular posture therefore posture you have learned leads to an emotional state which brings thoughts of a particular quality to your conscious awareness in this way you begin to notice the Interlink nature of your being as a system sometimes a thought will arise within you from seeing something externally this thought will then be the cause which generates Associated emotions which themselves will impact the body by becoming tense in certain areas other times The Impressions will impact you directly through the emotions which then arise certain mental and sematic reactions in parallel and even still sitting alone in a blank room old old Impressions and Sensations will arise out of memory what he said at work or what she said to us in high school or that one thing that happened that one time that always makes you cringe you know what I'm talking about through self-observation you begin to grasp a chain of cause and effect that runs through the functions of your human machine once you have this you can begin to change through hindsight your aim gives you a purpose whether it be to reach the higher cylinders GFF the Superman nii or the quizat hatak Dune you can now discard the categories of Good and Evil and merely ask is this useful did eating 12 pizzas bring me closer to the Superman or should I have done a workout was watching hours and hours of black pill content worth it or should I have spent that time learning an instrument or even just listening to music that I like through hindsight we judge our actions by how useful they were in bringing us closer to our aim this leaves behind all moralism and unexamined values that might have restricted us from moving forward and through developing the soil of hindsight we may experience the first sprouting of something new called foresight with foresight and hindsight the geometry of our being gains a new side fundamentally we have three selves now one of the the past that reaches forward through time to tweak our machine so we don't make the same errors and another self in the future that reaches back through time through foresight and warns us of dead ends in our path these two are reconciled in one our present the difference between us and others Normy NPCs is now our past our future and present are in constant dialogue this new dimension of time time is added to our being once you have this the only difference between you and your peers in the work will be differences in degree some will have developed a little foresight whereas others will seem as if eternity itself speaks through them now the only problem you'll have is if you can foresee your future trials will you have the power to triumph over them this now is a different question not one of Consciousness but one of will of fum but that that is a talk for another time and now a word from our sponsor ra Shadow just kidding there is no sponsor but you know what I do have

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EVtno1k54E,Wentao,there are ships sailing to many ports but not a single one goes where life is not painful this is a quote from the book of dis quiet by Fernando basoa my favorite Portuguese writer this was really formative um to my character because as I've mentioned before on this channel I misspent my 20s vagabonding around Europe and not creating any roots or particularly solid bonds so this quotee shook me to my core because it helped me understand the world not in a fatalistic Bleak perspective I don't think Fernando P was trying to promote despair I think this is a pragmatic acknowledgement of mortal life Universal mortal life not even suffering is certainly not unique to humans other earthlings are also privy to this luxury so I don't think it is an Earthly thing might be Universal for all Mortals alike this was pivotal for me to understand and uh appreciate Beauty joy and the endless precious moments that make life so unique so I have talked about Fon p in the past and and this is probably one of the most requested videos on this channel but it did take a long time for me to make it and the reason why it took about six months for me to make this video pretty much the entire time that I've been on on booktube is because I was avoiding cognitive gout allow me to explain Fernando P's writing is extremely rich it is Rich like port wine and blue cheese it is so rich in lyricism subjectivity and it has a strong focus on meta language which is um when we use language to talk about language itself to reflect on its structure to explore its function and to study the craft of writing itself so I reread a lot of his work poetry and Pros to refresh my memory and I also read uh some books about him by Scholars known to study P we're going to talk about them a little later on in the video for now allow me to remind you if you like books words and stories this is definitely the channel for you don't forget to like And subscribe and hit the notification Bell so you don't miss any of my videos check out my community tab I'm always posting polls quizzes stuff and um yeah so welcome to the linguist Library let's talk about the man himself Fernando P was born on the 13th of June in 1888 Lisbon Portugal and for the beginning of his life everything was fine until his father passed away from tuberculosis his father was a known music critic and his younger brother soon passed away between the ages of five and six a lot of tragic things happen in his life but fortunately for Fernando pooa his mother was extremely strong his mother is from the assoas the Portuguese islands and they are known for making people made of steel um so she remarried and um they ended up living in South Africa because she remarried the Portuguese Council for South Africa so Portuguese is from the P's first language but he was educated in English his first literary um moment happened when he was 12 he wrote an essay on the British historian moli and he signed it with this family name pesoa which originally had a circumflex Accent on top of the O but later on in his life he wanted to expand his uh reach and he wanted to be a bit more International you could tell this by his keyboard which was something that he created he manipulated so that he would be able to type in five different languages which back then without a digital keyboard was quite difficult but yeah so he dropped the accent to become a bit more Cosmopolitan he worked as a translator for British magazines he translated um Portuguese Proverbs for a British editor called Frank Palmer he but he is really unique when it comes to writers because of his heteronyms so his heteronyms which he very kindly explained to a friend on a letter a few more notes on this subject I see before me in the colorless yet real space of a dream the faces and gestures of cero hiard haes and a the compos I have constructed their ages and lives hiard Hayes was born in 1887 I don't remember the day and month but I have them written down somewhere in Porto is a doctor and is currently in Brazil Alberto CA was born in 1889 and died in 1915 he was born in Lisbon but lived almost all of his life in the countryside he had no profession ession and almost no education a the compus was born in Tav on October 15 1890 at 1:30 p.m. V Gomez tells me and it's true because after doing the horoscope that for that time it matches as you know he is a naval engineer from Glasgow but is now here in Lisbon inactive Cayo was of medium height and all though he was truly frail he died of tuberculosis he didn't seem as frail as he really was iard ha is slightly but very slightly shorter stronger but lean I the compos is tall 175 m 2 cm taller than me thin and slightly inclined to stoop all clean shaven Koo blonde without much color blue eyes Rays vaguely dark compos between light and dark vaguely resembling a Portuguese jew though his hair is straight and usually parted to the side and he wears a monocle cero as I said had almost no education only primarily schooling his parents died early and he stayed home living off a small income he lived with an old Aunt a great aunt hik haes educated in a Jesuit college is as I mentioned a doctor he has lived in Brazil since 1919 as he voluntarily expatiated himself for being a monarchist he is a latinist by external education and a semi helist by self-education Al the compus had a regular high school education later he was sent to Scotland to study engineering first mechanical then Naval during One Vacation he made a trip to the uran which resulted in an opary he was taught Latin by a beta born Uncle who was a priest how do I write in the name of these three cero by pure and unexpected inspiration without knowing or even calcul ating what I would write hi after an abstract deliberation that suddenly concretizes into an OD compos when I feel a sudden urged to write and don't know what my semi heteronym Bernardo Suarez who in many ways resembles Al of the compost always appears when I am tired or drowsy so that my qualities of reasoning and inhibition are somewhat suspended that Pros is a constant Daydream he is a semih heteronym because although the personality is not mine it is not different from mine but simply a mutilation of it he is me without reasoning or effectivity the pros except for what reasoning gives faintly to mine is identical to this and the Portuguese is perfectly the same while CYO wrote po poor Portuguese compos reasonably well but lapses like saying AIO instead of mismo Etc hay better than I do but with a purism I consider exaggerated it's difficult for me to write the pros of hay still unpublished or of compos the simulation is easier but because it is more spontaneous inverse so later uh in life when he returned to Lisbon he learned French because that was the defecto language of the Portuguese Elite um the European Elites really at the time he published um I think I only read one of his stories in French and uh most of his early stuff that he he published while he was still alive was in English so he has a collection um he was strongly influenced by Roman poets like Horus in fact the entire Western Canon was uh very well treasured by him so he was familiar with Cervantes Shakespeare all the Roman poets that I just described but also each one of his heteronyms was influenced by a particular writer most of Fernando P was work was not published while he was alive so he lived from 1888 till 1935 his famous work was mostly written between 1914 until 1934 35 and everything that was published during his lifetime was mostly in different languages in English specifically so he had a collection called Anton uh and then in English and then he had a second collection 35 sonnets which were both published in 198 he has a collection of English poems third collection which was published in 1921 and he gained notor Rarity because of a national competition that was um trying to find the Portuguese Spirit uh it was about nationalism and national pride right so this was 1934 and this is when he published mening which is patriotic mystical collection that contemplates past glories from the Conquistador era through modernday Portugal it Rhymes in Portuguese um but I found a way to translate it in English that also Rhymes but Loosely it would be all is worth the stride if the soul is wide so when it comes to his book um the translations that I found are quite varied so you have Richardson's translation you have margar Joe Costa with um jono pisado who's a scholar on Fernando pooa and they have translated the complete works of each heteronym separately Zenith chose to put a collection of all three of the main poets as well as Ron himself together in a collection called a little larger than the entire universe this is by penguin modern Classics and you also have the selected poems which was not translated by Richard Zenith but it is an older translation and it was awarded a poetry translation award called pen in 1999 so for his Pros you have the book of theet this one being the latest and this was translated by the Colombian scholar jono pizo and the Superstar translator Margaret Joe Costa who is my favorite translator for this combination from Portuguese to English um I've referred to her as the Kelly Clarkson of translation and I stand by that statement Richard Zen of's biography pesoa a biography was a finalist for the pulit a prize and I highly recommend it I read it for this video and he superb he is such a a well of of um knowledge such a well of information when it comes to F pesoa I am anthology by The Marvelous Geronimo pisaro and this is where I found out the 77 exclusive heteronyms that I didn't know of before including his female um heteronym so it's a total of 136 heteronyms that F created in his life before I go I'd like to read you a poem this one is called poem in a straight line and it's by the heteronym a de compos I never knew a s who ever took a liing my friends have all been Champions at everything and I I so often vulgar so often obscene so often vile I so deliberately parasitical unforgivably filthy I so often without patience to take a bath I who've been so ridiculous so absurd tripping up in public on the carpet of etiquette I so grotesque and mean submissive and

their life lives how I would love to hear a human voice from any of them confessing not to sins but to infamies speaking not of violent but cowardly acts but no each one is a paragon to hear them tell

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4pL2Cvy0t4,Wentao,that you used to go up on Mulholland Drive and park every night and visualize seeing yourself as yeah I would visualize uh yeah this is where you were broken poor right having directors interested in me and people that I respected uh um saying you know I like your work or whatever that is and and uh I would visualize things coming to me that I wanted or whatever so didn't you write yourself a check I heard that you did is that true I wrote myself a check for 10 million dollars for acting services rendered and I gave myself uh five years or three years maybe and uh and I dated at Thanksgiving 1995. and I put it in my wallet and I kept it there and it deteriorated and deteriorated and stuff but then just before Thanksgiving 1995 I found out that I was going to make 10 million dollars on I think it was Dumb and Dumber Dumb and Dumber yeah yeah so you visualize yourself throughout history the most successful artists athletes and inventors have used a secret technique to create their success there is no difference between you and these great successful people other than they had the ability and knowledge to harness these techniques these techniques are never taught to the average person which is a shame because if used correctly they can transform one from poverty to wealth from sickness to health Napoleon Hill set the greatest sin of all of mankind was the neglect to use this greatest asset he said if you use this acid you will have everything you want in abundance he didn't say within reason he said everything in abundance stay tuned to the end of this video and I will show you step by step how to use this secret technique to get everything you want in your life but first here's what a few people you may know have to say about it when people talk about visualization how does visualization help with that you wrote a lot about [Music] my dreams and visualizing kind of really played a role in to making me motivated and helping me achieve the goals that I had it is everything for me I literally sat down two three months before and I've made a decision in my head that practicing regularly their visuals running in my head me dominating that bullet I had to Envision it because if I didn't I wouldn't be here so not only did I Envision it I envisioned it so much so clearly and so precisely in my head that I'm here now and visualization is a it's a huge factor in improving technical skills when you focus on something and you really things can really happen in in your life visualization still can actually cause a rewiring of the brain beneficially I visualized I'm sitting here on the steering we're visualizing a brand new car and visualizing good things in in times of struggle we had done it a thousand times in his head he had warmed up and backstage he had heard a crowd he had smelt the arena you'd see in the audience he would really immerse himself in the in the in the fight night so by the time Fight Night come along he's the walking on yeah this is my thousandth time doing this with all of these great people are doing is seeing their Vision in their Mind's Eye in in 3D before they achieve it if you want to change the station on your TV you change the frequency if you want to change the station on your radio you change the frequency see your mind is an electromagnet once you charge it with a clear image of what you want you change your frequency you change your channel and you magnetize it to you you no longer have to chase after it anymore it will start to chase you see this is better than the Law of Attraction it's called The Law of assumption it was first discovered by Neville Goddard Goddard said assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and continue therein and the universe has no choice but to harden your assumption into present fact Goddard said it's not about believing in it it's about believing it in don't broadcast what you want simply assume you already have it this will create the deja vu effect you rehearse a situation successfully in your mind and then it happens in reality giving you the deja vu feeling or oh I've already been here before now this capacity is not inborn in fact I'll show you how to do it at the end of this video but first here's a few people you may know who have used this technique Aristotle said the soul cannot dream without pictures Vincent van Gogh said I dream my painting and then I paint my dream the great Walt Disney when he was on his deathbed he was interviewed by a reporter on his final day the reporter told him sir you have this amazing Epcot being built by your friend Ken Kerr but you will never see it how does that make you feel and then Disney looked up at him and said you don't get it if I didn't see it you'll never see Roger Bannister the man who broke the four minute mile said he did it because he visualized it many times before the race he said he visualized the event to create a sense of certainty in his mind and body he would close his eyes and see the race step by step he would create the image he would he would see the finish line and hear the crowd in his mind little known fact Roger Bannister went on to become a neuroscientist in his book mind gym Gary Mack says that Brazilian soccer player Pele before every game would go to the locker room an hour earlier before everyone else he would lie down using a towel as a pillow and cover his eyes he would watch a film of himself as a kid playing soccer on the beach in Brazil this movie in his mind brought back glorious memories and he would vividly recall the thrill of the game and the joy he would immerse himself in the Love of the Game in short before every game he would put himself in touch with his pure love for the sport after that Pele would watch himself reliving some of his greatest moments in World competitions he would let himself feel the winning moments and enjoy the intensity and those feelings over and over he talked about how crucial it was to make a strong connection with those images and feelings finally he would see himself as he was about to become playing brilliantly scoring goals in a mental movie made up of positive images of enjoyment and Triumph he imagined everything before it happened the field his opponents his team he saw himself playing Like A Champion a force that could not be stopped he said remember it's not just about the visuals and the imagery it's more about the feelings the emotions associated with success he vividly imagined how good it all felt only after 30 minutes of this visualization would Pele then start to warm up and stretch his actual muscles he primed his mind for victory and Pele who some say is the world's greatest soccer player of all time was Unstoppable all of these great people harnessed the power of the law of assumption to succeed now you may be asking yourself are there any scientific studies that support the power of visualization or the law of assumption well the answer is yes in 1996 a study by Dr Bia Soto from the University of Chicago was conducted via Soto split his participants into three groups and tested how many free throws they could make he had the first group practice shooting free throws for one hour he had the second group just visualized themselves making free throws and he had the third group do nothing after 30 days he tested them again the first group who practiced shooting free throws improved by 24 the third group didn't improve at all but the second group the group who only visualized themselves making free throws improved 23 without ever touching a basketball there was another study where people practice the five finger piano exercise for two hours a day they showed a similar increase in brain activity as those who practiced solely in their imagination without ever touching a keyboard scientists have confirmed that the brain does not know the difference between a vivid imagination and reality therefore using visualization you can actually improve performance without actually engaging in the activity see that's why Einstein said imagination is greater than knowledge in another study scientists have the participants imagine flexing their biceps as hard as they could for five times a week in a few weeks they increase their bicep strength by almost 14 percent without ever doing a curl and there are other studies that have had similar results okay now here's the part that you've all been waiting for here's how you create success in your life through the power of visualization you can use this technique to succeed in any area of life from earning 10 million dollars like Jim Carrey did to overcoming stage fright or anxiety in dating and it only takes 10 minutes a day set your time you can do this by sitting in a chair or if you prefer just laying down now there are two ways to do visualization the first is you see the scene playing out in your mind but through your own eyes as if you are already there the second way is to see yourself on a movie screen this is called Mind theater Studies have compared the two methods and the first method of seeing it through your own eyes is more powerful but for me I like to do both of them now the first step is to relax your body relax your eyes relax your face relax your shoulders relax your entire body it may take up to 10 minutes to get into a completely relaxed state but this is important because relaxation allows the message to enter your inner subconscious now the next step I got from the silver method which is all about putting your mind into the Alpha Brain State what you want to do is you want to visualize the numbers three and then two and then one and then you go into Alpha State the Alpha Brain state is a state of creativity and learning it's also called The Flow State now after you do this I want you to fully immerse yourself in the environment of your goal see yourself with the gold image whether it's winning the race holding the trophy cashing the check walking into the house Etc remember the greater the detail the quicker the attainment of your vision include images of overcoming adversity see yourself fighting your way out of things overcoming it and reaching success the next step is bringing in Big Time emotion intense feeling into the visualization Goddard said feeling is the secret the next step is to make it Vivid Vivid Vivid make it clear remember the clearer the more detailed the vision the quicker the attainment next I want you to engage all of your senses I'm talking total sensory immersion what does it feel like to move your muscles is there any wind what does the ground feel like underneath your feet are there any smells in the environment the grass the outdoor what do you hear how are you breathing feel the rise and fall of all of these senses and emotions and finally just feel enthusiastically how it feels to have already achieved your goal behave as if you already have it believe that you already have it and that's it you can do this for 10 to 20 minutes every day this technique this secret if done correctly will turn you into a magnet attracting everything you want in abundance I mean think about it look around your room right now everything you see came out of the human mind came out of the human imagination and therefore imagination creates reality action turns into fact how many science fiction movies became fact nearly all of them the biggest problem that most people face is imagining what they don't want which is why Napoleon Hill said if you spend as much time visualizing success as you do thinking about failure you would change your life once again guys it's not about a feeling of craving of wanting of Desiring because that will simply push everything away the law of assumption is about matching the vibration as though it is already done because as Neville Goddard said assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and the universe will have no choice but to harden that assumption into present fact peace ,"Once you VISUALIZE CORRECTLY, the SHIFT happens IMMEDIATELY.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RixMPF4xis,Wentao,artificial intelligence and machine learning what's the difference are they the same well some people kind of frame the question this way it's AI versus ml is that the right way to think of this or is it AI equals ml or is it AI is somehow something different than ml so here's three equations I wonder which one is going to be right well let's talk about this first of all when we talk about AI I think it's important to come with definitions because a lot of people have different ideas of what this is so I'm going to assert the simple definition that AI is basically exceeding or matching the capabilities of a human so we're trying to match the intelligence whatever that means and capabilities of a human subject now what could that involve there's a number of different things for instance one of them is the ability to discover to find out new information another is the ability to infer to read in information from other sources that maybe has not been explicitly stated and then also the ability to reason the ability to figure things out I put this and this together and I come up with something else so I'm going to suggest to you this is what AI is and that's the definition we'll use for this discussion now what kinds of things then would be involved if we were talking about doing machine learning well Machine learning I'm going to put that over here is basically a capability we'll start with a Venn diagram machine learning involves predictions or decisions based on data think about this as a very sophisticated form of statistical analysis it's looking for predictions based upon information that we have so the more we feed into the system the more it's able to give us accurate predictions and decisions based upon that data it's something that learns that's the L part rather than having to be programmed when we program a system I have to come up with all the code and if I wanted to do something different I have to go change the code and then get a different outcome in the machine learning situation what I'm doing could be adjusting some models but is different than programming and mostly it's learning the more data that I give to it so it's based on large amounts of information and there's a couple of different fields within couple of different types there is supervised machine learning and as you might guess there's an unsupervised machine learning and the main difference as the name implies is one has more human oversight looking at the training of the data using labels that are superimposed on the data unsupervised is kind of able to run more uh and and find things that were not explicitly stated okay so that's machine learning it turns out that there's a subfield of machine learning that we call Deep learning and what is deep learning well this involves things like neural networks neural networks involve nodes and statistical relationships between those nodes to model the way that our minds work and it's called Deep because we're doing multiple layers of those neural networks now the interesting thing about deep learning is we can end up with some very interesting insights but we might not always be able to tell how the system came up with that it doesn't always show its work fully so we could end up with some really interesting information not know in some cases how reliable that is because we don't know exactly how it was derived but it's still a very important part of all of this realm that we're dealing with so those are two areas and you can see DL is a subset of ml but what about artificial intelligence where does that fit in the Venn diagram and I'm going to suggest to you it is the superset of mldl and a bunch of other things what could the other of things be well we can involve things like natural language processing uh it could be vision so we want a system that's able to see we might even want a system that's able to hear and be able to distinguish what it's hearing and what it's seeing because after all humans are able to do that and that's part of what our brains do is distinguish those kinds of things it can involve other things like the ability to do text to speech so if we take written words Concepts and be able to speak those out so this first one involved being able to see things this is now being able to speak those things as well and then other things that humans are able to do naturally that we often take for granted is motion this is the field of Robotics which is a subset of AI the ability to just do simple things like tie our shoes open and close the door lift something walk somewhere that's all something that would be part of human capabilities and involves certain sorts of perceptions calculations that we do in our brains that we don't even think about so here's what it comes down to it's a Venn diagram and we've got machine learning We've Got Deep learning and we've got AI so I'm going to suggest to you the right way to think about this is not these equations those are not the way to look at it in fact what we should think about this as machine learning is a subset of a high and that's how we need to think about this when I'm doing machine learning in fact I am doing AI when I'm doing these other things I'm doing AI but none of them are all of AI but they're a very important part

https://youtu.be/FV1ZoFn2HfM?si=LbYXUAsBXi8NWxN_,Marysia,"like a lot of doubt that anybody would want to listen to me but I need to change my mindset a little bit and I'm really going to give it a shot as of today and start working harder to put out you know really good quality content and try to do what I love I left my day job at the age of 24 solely by a couple different side hustles and Investments I've since created a sixf figure business and achieved kind of lean Financial Freedom and I was able to do pretty much all that just through self-education by reading like over 100 books and really just by experimenting and trying a bunch of different things so today I wanted to share 10 lessons that made that possible [Music] when I first heard about the idea of reaching Financial Independence in your 20s and 30s it seemed completely impossible when I looked at other YouTubers who had over 100,000 subscribers it seemed like the same odds of that happening to me as would be like winning the lottery like it's just not going to happen but then I read this book called The 4-Hour Work week and this was the first time I saw example after example of people reaching Financial Freedom in a bunch of different non-glamorous ways then I started listening to podcasts and reading books and networking with people and I met person after person and listened to person after person do all the things that I wanted to do and I realized that there was like a 100% chance that if I never took the first step which for me at the time was starting a YouTube channel then this would never happen for me in fact I have a video of me literally having that realization like 5 years ago I need to change my mindset a little bit and I'm really going to give it a shot as of today and start working harder to put out you know really good quality content content and try to do what I love you know what's the worst that can happen like I I I really want to hit that level and be able to do something that I love each week and not not this crap you know check back in a year from today 5 years later I have you know a YouTube channel that has over half a million subscribers which does not seem real I've been able to build it up into a multiple six figureure business even before all that I was able to follow kind of less traditional path and buy multiple rentals and be able to build up enough income that I could leave my day job even if you take YouTube out of it all those things that seemed impossible ible became a reality there was this quote that really kind of helped me take progress here it's like you overestimate how much you can do in a year but you underestimate how much you could do in 5 years if you just stick with something and you try for something for Five for 10 years your life will be 100% different you can do those things that seem impossible that seems like a good ending networking this is something that I always kind of bypassed until I actually saw results I actually just got tickets for vidsummit and finc con which are two like events for creators it's going to end up costing me multiple thousands of dollars but I started going to vidsummit a couple years ago and after the first time going there and meeting with a bunch of other creators my channel had an enormous Spike and then because of somebody that I met at vidsummit last year paid $11,000 just for the ticket and then hotel and flights as well I have made back about $100,000 from that person that I met there and some ideas and projects that we've worked on together so I literally cannot afford to not network with people because you never know what one person you meet what one idea that you have that can literally make you lifechanging money and turn your life in a different direction it seemed absolutely crazy and the first time I went I knew nobody but just being around people who have achieved my dreams and asking them how they did it made the road to get there seem like possible and plausible I don't know this was always like a hard one for me to actually grasp because you put money in and like there's no clear line of where you're getting your money back but investing into educating yourself and being around other high performing people is for me one of the best investments I have ever made by the way if anybody's going to either of those hit me up let's connect the myth of hard work I was absolutely lied to by people who had the best intentions that if you work hard you know you can become successful and don't get me wrong being successful does take hard work but if I look at the different areas of my life where I have worked hard there have only been a couple that have actually made a positive impact in my finances like when I was cleaning Office Buildings I could work as hard as humanly possible and it wouldn't really change my finances at all like it might make the company do better it might make me not lose my job all good stuff but it doesn't really matter however if I put even 50% of that effort into something that has a much higher scale well now I could earn a lot more by doing a lot less stuff so it doesn't matter as much how hard you work at something as the thing that you are actually working on is it a business that is scalable is it a job that is scalable is it learning the right thing is it doing the right thing the cool thing about owning your own business is you can put a lot of work into you know building this business and then you can get it set up to the point like I have where you can run it in 5 hours a week and you put in less and less efforts but the rewards actually grow and grow and if you're doing that exact same amount of effort but you put that into a a conventional 9 to5 or just doing something else you're just not going to have the same benefits so make sure that you're not only putting in hard work but it's hard work on the right thing now like I said YouTube was that right thing for me and that's why I'm hosting a free YouTube growth workshop and YouTube monetization Workshop like how to make money from a small channel so if that's something you want to check out it's completely free you can register down below find your freedom number this was yet another lesson that I learned from the 4-Hour Work week and that is that even this idea of financial Independence and the fire movement that if you save up x amount of money 25 times your annual expenses you can live off that money indefinitely and while that's way better than working to your 65 it's also a very slow approach so I actually kind of took some ideas from this book and a bunch of other ones and kind of built myself a freedom number that if I could earn between $3 and $5,000 a month by building up Investments and my own businesses then I could pretty much do whatever I wanted for the rest of my life as long as I earned that amount of money and I was able to build up Investments through real estate investing and other things in about 3 years from when I actually started if you do the math and you lower your living expenses and you find out that if you make $3,000 a month then you'll be pretty much set maybe not forever but you can live then you have this goal to create passive income not really passive but somewhat passive income in the next 3 or 5 years and if you can do that you will be at Financial Freedom not a million dollar in the bank type of Financial Freedom but it also won't take 10 to 20 years to get there saving half of your income once once I discovered I was that close I did whatever it took I worked multiple jobs I invested my life savings into real estate twice I renovated Apartments I I worked extra I started businesses and within 3 to 5 years of actually taking this seriously and starting I left my day job and I have never gone back to a day job and I've completely controlled my schedule since then I've been able to travel like a month a year and have relative Financial Freedom and have a scalable business all because I realized I was this close to a goal I wasn't like years away I was really close and most of you are too if you restructure what Financial Independence looks like and not try to get away from ever working again but just make a couple thousand a month doing something you enjoy doing that's actually not incredibly hard if you focus for a couple years but the problem is you need to have an obsession in fact I think that is the secret nval who has an amazing book called The Almanac says that you need to be deliberate with your obsessions and if I look at most of the successful people that I know whether they you know built a large Channel they have a you know a bunch of real estate they travel a lot whatever it is that I aspire to for them most of them are obsessed about something positive like when I first started reading different Finance books I became obsessed while I was working cleaning offices I was listening to audiobooks while I was in the car while I was at home while I was at the gym I was listening to podcasts watching YouTube videos listening to books at one point I was listening to almost a book a day cuz I had about 8 hours of listening time I just always had an earbud in and I was just listening listening listening to this stuff I was brainwashing myself I became obsessed I learned so many different things and I tried a bunch of those things and eventually because I was so obsessed about that things started to happen I started to find real estate deals I took action on those deals I never spent money on things that didn't lead to the desired outcome that I want it even with YouTube I think this is unhealthy but I've become obsessed about YouTube how to grow it how to be better how to how to share personal stories better and for the past 5 years I have not really had any days go by maybe one or two that I have not worked on my YouTube channel in some way and because of that maybe unhealthy Obsession I have built the life of My Dreams by just obsessing about something that I knew could change my life life if I could make it happen and then just doing one thing every day to get me closer to that goal and then you zoom out it happened somehow I don't I don't know how it happened it was just I was so obsessed with it so most of us have an obsession if yours is unhealthy like it's social media or it's something else switch it to something that can change your life obsess about a business Investments whatever it is and zoom back a couple of years your life will change copy what works I want to make sure this comes across I am nobody special I'm not overly intelligent in fact I didn't finish High School I would say I'm generally under intelligent if that's that's not corre English I'm not I think I'm proving to my point but what I can do is look at patterns and copy patterns it's true when it came to you know leaving my day job at 24 and reaching Financial Independence I didn't do anything special I just stole what other people were doing and copied it exactly and that's how I've literally achieved everything I've ever done I don't think I'm super original I don't think I'm super creative not super smart I'm like average in all those I'm not trying to like down on myself but I'm just trying to let you know that those people that you know who are doing whatever you want to be doing they're not a ton different than you and most of them actually got help and just copied what was actually working for me I didn't come up with the idea of house hacking you know buying a multi family living in one unit renting the other ones out I stole that from a couple different books I didn't come up with the idea of starting YouTube channel actually don't know why I started a YouTube channel but I assume I stole that from somebody I was actually talking to my wife about this I have no idea why I started it I was just so obsessed about this money stuff that I wanted to share it with people but when it came to Growing that YouTube channel I listened to what all the expert says and then I did what they say so if you're stuck right now and you want to learn something I would recommend not starting from scratch just take a course on whatever business you want to learn and copy exactly what they did and do that if there's anything I want to learn now I pay for a course I copy exactly what they say I generally get really good results but because like 90% of people don't finish courses that's why everybody thinks they're a scam and some of them are but for the most part if you follow exactly what somebody tells you to do who has done it before you can just steal what they're doing and copy it and it will work for you if you do it correctly it's like don't try to get cute with it don't try to be too smart just steal what works screw Dave Ramsey while Dave Ramsey has helped more people than I could ever dream of with their finances there are a few ideas that I just don't personally agree with if you want to go that approach totally totally fine but his General approach is save money invest very conservatively when you're 65 you'll have a few million dollars and that is absolutely awesome for most people I am not most people I a little mentally off and I am okay with that and I personally would rather do a lot more risky things try a bunch of things take complete ownership myself on if I succeed or if I fail and have the chance to build a life that I don't want an escape from have the chance to reach Financial Independence leave my J job when I'm 24 something I would never be able to do if I avoided debt at all cost if I did a bunch of the things Dave Ramsey says and I realized that most people are not entrepreneurial most people don't want the responsibility you know investing in real estate or starting their own business and that is totally fine but if you want to reach freedom in 3 5 or 10 years you cannot do the approach that you know the mainstream is telling you to do you can't even save 50% of your income you need to go a different approach so this just comes down to kind of introspection of you know what type of person you are but for me personally realizing that you know there's not one approach that is perfect for everybody and there's so many different paths to freedom and you know some people love 9 to five some people don't I'm one of the that don't and it's okay you don't have to follow everything Dave Ramsey says you don't have to follow everything and set for life you don't even have to follow everything the 4-Hour Work week but if you can blend these together and and make a life that you love that's where it's at right there just steal a few things that match you copy those and leave the rest it's the same thing with the diet not one thing works for every single person the 31 rule this simply states that for every 1 hour you spend learning studying whatever all which is is very very good for every 1 hour you spend doing that you should spend 3 hours actually doing what the stuff you just read said to do so many people get caught in this trap of like self-improvement where they consume a bunch of self-improvement stuff but they don't actually do most of what it says and that's why you get stuck in this trap and 5 years later your life hasn't changed really at all even though you're watching or reading a bunch of stuff about it and sometimes I I I've done that for sure where I've just read and I didn't actually do anything when I actually started doing stuff that's where a lot of success actually happens so unless you're just getting started in this for every 1 hour you spend learning something spend 3 hours actually implementing it spend 3 hours working on the business and not learning more about it and by doing that you'll learn a lot of stuff that you're forced to learn it's like if you spend an hour watching a video on how to declutter your house spend 3 hours actually decluttering your house and your life will totally change as opposed to 3 hours of watching that stuff and then not really doing anything action almost always beats learning mean as long as you have like kind of a base level of understanding if you enjoy this video you can check out this video for my second Channel which is all

https://youtu.be/NdCia_d1u5c?si=-DV53GCRwzOIk0FS,Marysia,"Hey everyone Jason here welcome back. Today we are learning how to shuffle cards for beginners. This is the riffle shuffle with bridge in the hands.
It can be done standing, on the table, in your face, just about anywhere so if you don't know how to shuffle cards you're in the right place even if you do keep watching who knows you might improve your technique now I'll show you the move step by step then we'll see some cool slow-motion footage and at the very end I'll give you some specific troubleshooting techniques first take the cards in your dominant hand you want two fingers on the bottom your thumb on top and one finger on each side then you're going to split the cards about in half using the other hand like that let's try that a little bit slower so your fingers are in this position the thumb from the other hand comes over breaks the cards about in half then it rotates down the other hand helps push it up and over and the thumb takes it on top now the hands should be in a symmetrical position from this position you're going to have to adjust your hands before you can move on there's several things that happen all at once then it kind of looks like this so to break it down as soon as you get into this position if your hands are like this and if you'll notice the thumb is sticking away off the edge and that's not where we want it we need the thumb to be more like that so you can more carefully release cards one at a time first we need to move the thumbs back and I can move the thumbs freely because of the way I'm holding the cards on the bottom securely so move the thumbs back then you're gonna bring the fingers to the bottom and smash the deck into your palm like this I mean I forgot to add you can use all three fingers at the bottom or just two like this whichever is more comfortable so you can securely hold them that way when you riffle the cards they don't fly everywhere it's like you don't need a table because you've created your own table in the air okay so those things happen in fairly rapid succession so from here it's adjust adjust then you're going to turn your hands this and then you're going to move your fingers around to the backside because you need them here to create the pressure at this point you create the pressure you want a lot and you let them individually fall one after the other like that you put your thumb on top I move my fingers around here so I'm holding the cards securely between here and my thumbs and of course these fingers so everything's held very securely right now next you want to bend the cards up so it goes like this you're just bending them up into an arch shape and you really need to keep your thumbs on top like this and you're pushing inwards so everything's kind of stuck there but when I start to release pressure from the bottom they ripple together now that didn't look great because I was going so slow but in real time let's go through it one more time so you take the cards in your dominant hand note the finger position you should be doing the same divide the cards about in half immediately you just your thumbs you bring it in closer to your palm you rotate down move the fingers around then you can start to release the cards and at this point you really want to make sure you're bending the cards enough you have kind of an L shape or like a 90 degree angle on both sides like this push and Bend and basically you're releasing pressure just a little bit here and that allows the cards to start falling now you're not going to damage your cards unless you hold them in that place for a long time like I did but really it's not an issue if you're going quickly because you bend them one way then you've been in the opposite way so your deck is going like that then like this and it's not a problem now let's check this out in slow motion breaking the deck in half rotating it over some grabs the top immediately repositioning the thumbs grabbing the deck and closer to the palm fingers go around the back to create pressure hands are rotating inwards you can see the L shape as the cards are released immediately the thumbs go on top fingers positioned around create the arch and slowly but surely releasing the pressure near the bottom now as promised troubleshooting I actually have four tips to help you here number one perhaps your cards are getting stuck like this that's no good so what's going on here how do we solve that it's easy basically when you're doing this shuffle you need to consider the rotation of your hands so you don't want to be like this you don't want to be like that you want to be deeply rotated enough down because if you're just a little bit rotated it's gonna stick so it's just rotate more downwards like this no problem this no good this real good number to releasing cards more individually unless in huge chunks here's the problem we have large chunks of cards here but it's better to have more of an even mix so how do we accomplish that well it's actually not too hard again you just need to make sure you have that l-shape I told you about that 90 degree Bend because what that does is if you look at the edge of the cards here right now it's hard to release the cards individually because the cards come at a flat angle here so when you bend them enough like really bend them you'll see it creates a bevel now it's much easier to release the cards one at a time so basically just make sure you're bending the cards hard enough and really creating an L shape you get a much better result than before number three now if you're still having issues with big clumps of cards being released all at once try doing this just turn the cards face up because some decks are cut in a different way just shuffling the cards face up could make it easier on you while you're learning give it a try and see if it helps lastly if you're still having trouble trying to learn this move just grab an older deck older cards are more flexible so it doesn't require as much muscle to bend them as well as being less slippery the cards don't slide because they're older when you're trying to learn with a new deck you might find like they're sliding around too much and maybe requires too much force to bend them so just as kind of training wheels you can learn with an old deck but of course you should be able to shuffle with both of them in the future that's it if you enjoyed the video smash like leave a comment below let me know what you thought and if you want to see more

https://youtu.be/X0Omnt24tIc?si=qyeDHHNik1yUQNPs,Marysia,"lots of teenagers are about to get very rich why is that well the data strongly shows that traditional jobs are being replaced and online jobs are booming but surely that means there'll be too much competition in the online space well teenagers have an advantage as they understand the online World better than anyone else it's just second nature but Mark I don't know what to do well that's why I'm going to be revealing the 7.5 best paid online jobs for teenagers and this isn't any old list for each one I'm going to provide a real life example of a teenager currently killing it in that job job one is an advertising deal broker teenagers doing this job earn as much as1 to $120,000 per year in 2021 I bought a Tesla Model 3 and I set myself a bit of a challenge I wanted to see if it was possible to use lots of different side hustles to earn back the price of the car one of the ideas my son and I came up was to get it wrapped like a race car which would involve securing paid advertisements at this point we received a cold email from a teenager called Christian completely out of the blue who said that he was able to secure the sponsorship we required for a 30% commission Christian managed to get an offer of $30,000 on the table had we accepted this deal he would have made a sweet $9,000 for essentially matching us with the brand and acting as the middleman in the end Curtis managed to secure a different deal with public.com so we went with them however Christian has managed to secure many of these deals in the past that's why we can still offer you a free stock worth all
successful with this job is to make friends in the right places he described it a lot like a jungle where one branch would lead to the next one and so on once you start working with one big company it becomes a lot easier as you can reference them as a past client and therefore demonstrate that you have experience in the areas that they require so how does he do it he uses different software to get the email addresses of influencers and just fires off messages until he gets a bite then he evaluates the needs of the clients that contact him back and runs a similar campaign focused on reaching out to brands on the influencers behalf it kind of reminds me of the book How to Win Friends and Influence People where Dale Carnegie talks about sending mail to powerful people and getting replies only the modern day version if we learn anything from Christian it's the power of a good reference and relationships always do your best work because you never know where something might lead in the future job two is a Discord Community manager for web 3 these team make more than $70,000 a year depending on their multitasking ability when it comes to marketing for Gen Z Community is everything every brand Under the Sun is trying to build a community around their product this is actually the main reason why gym shark have set up their first store in London real purpose of the store needs to be to really cultivate the gym shark community and connect with people now if you've ever used Discord then you've probably met a community manager they're like the glue that holds everything together I know a guy called Harry who hires Community managers he said that he wouldn't bat an eyelid at paying more than $2,000 per week if they were good at the job and represented the brand in a positive light additionally if you're good at multitasking there's nothing stopping you from being a community manager for three or four projects at the same time which means big money the job of the community manager is to be on the front line you have to tell the story of the brand be customer service and support as well as supporting people when they're down and paying attention to Global events you need to be able to pause your schedule be active when people are looking for you and listen when people need your attention Above All you have to be the voice of the CEO but not always speak on behalf of the company job three is writing scripts for Content creators these teams can earn upwards of $100,000 but can go a lot higher depending on the type of content and your experience words can make you sound smart or they can do the opposite depending on how they're deployed that's why businesses hire copywriters basically salesman in print copywriters can make insane amounts of money I'm talking over $500 an hour in many cases it all depends on how good you are at making connections your skill with words and how fast you can write some charge as much as $50,000 for just one web page you may be thinking why so much well it's all about value if you charge $50,000 for a web page and it results in a business monthly profit going from $200,000 to $400,000 wouldn't you say it's worth it it's all about leverage making rich clients even richer then asking for your slice of the pie and it's not just websites either people need quality writers for all sorts of things everything from Tik Tok scripts to threads on Twitter content is king and the magician behind all of this is often the writer I know a guy named Adam he started off writing blog posts about his travels to earn passive income and live anywhere in the world this later led him to working as a copywriter for large influencers he followed the same strategy as Christian got one client which led to another and so on he told me when he offers a service he always tries to be exclusive and do it in a way that no one else could there's always going to be someone cheaper than you but not always someone more expensive find the client who can afford to pay the premium then learn to offer a worldclass service job four is a SAS software coder these team can earn between $60 and $80,000 a year a guy called Sam King came on my podcast strike it big and explained how he built a multi-million dollar Business Without ever having a normal job instead of building a traditional business he decided to build a SAS company this stands for software as a service just think of how many online tools you use on a daily basis I know I love notion MailChimp Photoshop and many more these online tools have become such a big part of our life and once the app is built it's almost entirely profit Sam said there's so many people out there trying to sell the same type of product with such tight margin it's a race to the bottom with traditional businesses people start businesses to be free but end up becoming slaves that's why he wanted to create a business with no inventory and something that could de infinitely all he needed was a good coder and a bit of marketing this is where you could help out as a coder or alternatively come up with the SAS idea he started by Googling and researching the problems and challenges faced by different types of businesses then had his programmer create the perfect solution he ended up building a tool that helps people and businesses manage their social media accounts called flick so the one thing to take from Sam's journey is that the most important part of business is solving an issue that affects a lot of people in a better way than what's currently available job five is a Content redistribution editor they can make $120 to $150,000 per year ever had some food left over and decided just to throw it all in a pot and turn it into a soup well that's what someone I know called Josh does but with video content the idea came to him while he was at vidsummit he was in a room with a variety of influences when suddenly a light bulb went off in his head he didn't have to create create his own content he just took existing videos and remixed them for YouTubers that wanted to post short form content he took podcasts and YouTube videos and made them Tik Tok and Instagram friendly giving his clients the ability to reach much wider audiences without actually producing any new content themselves it's called content redistribution it's like recycling but in the digital age it doesn't take too much time but large creators don't want the hassle of editing everything themselves Josh later went on want to hire team member so that he could serve more clients and increase his income job six is a website developer Keens doing this can earn an average annual salary of around 80 to $150,000 per year for many businesses their website is their front door so they want to make it as stylish as possible I've got a friend named Chris who lives out in Italy he decided he wanted to Niche down into the e-learning space and focus on building marketing funnels a good website developer knows that if you keep your clients on a monthly retainer you can earn passive income just by doing small tweaks here and there Chris told me that the best way forward is to start a subscription business with reoccurring Revenue think Netflix he said the best job is one that requires very little maintenance you just keep clients on a retainer and voila he now has enough passive income to live almost anywhere in the world he often travels to cheap countries like Thailand where he can live on less than $1,000 a month he doesn't focus on earning as much money as possible he said that's just just a trap the point of making money is to buy yourself Freedom job seven is a Twitter manager teens can earn around 60 to $8,000 per year doing this job Twitter seems to be the hottest social media nowadays especially since the whole Elon mus takeover I know a College Dropout called sha who wasted a lot of his time trolling on Twitter until he asked himself what if I could actually make a job out of this so he decided to become a Twitter expert he took a lot of time to study the content put out by some of the best creators don't just look at the recent stuff though he told me look at the post that really made them blow up then study it that's what you want to go for he said two of the best ways to blow up nowadays on Twitter is to create threads and host spaces you need to be able to capture people's attention with as few words as possible and hook them in and that takes a lot of practice but this is a very valuable skill to learn just like the others he said he takes multiple clients on at the same time and much like RIS keeps them on a retainer job 7.5 is an executive assistant it's a bonus because it can become more than just an online job these team can make 90 to $110,000 per year you'll be doing everything from scheduling appointments to making small decisions every day a good example of this is Gabe from Neel he does so much for them if you make yourself totally indispensable no one will ever get rid of you and that's the case with Gabe a great perk to this job is potentially traveling around around with these influencers and seeing all sorts of cool and amazing places just like with Christian Gabe understood the power of connections it seems like anything is possible nowadays in the digital world all you need to do is think about something you can offer some kind of value to the world then send emails reach out and make sure everyone knows what you do artificial intelligence is going to be a big moneymaker for teens in the future so if you want to learn how to use AI to get rich then I'm going to leave that video right up there but don't click on it just yet make sure to subscribe if you want to grow your wealth okay

https://youtu.be/yt6zuQbETMI?si=ow6W5OS-b39q75In,Marysia,hi this is david stuckler from fasttrack grad and today i want to share with you my secret formula of how to write a paper in as little as a weekend over the past 10 years i've published over 300 peer-reviewed papers in top scientific journals and i've coached hundreds of graduate students on how to do the same and i want to teach you today how to overcome those barriers that you may have to writing a paper fast so stick around to the very end because i'm going to share with you some tips that you may not have ever heard before so the first step is to get everything in place it's like cooking dinner you need to have your onions chopped your tomatoes at the ready and olive oil ready to go if you don't it can lead to confusion too often i i see students trying to write the paper as they go along thinking it's going to be more efficient but it's not writing is the last 10 of your project so don't even bother starting if you don't have that heart of your paper your your findings your figures your tables ready to go tip number two and this is incredibly important and not everybody knows this so often i see students start to write their paper they get stuck they just stare blankly at the computer for hours and the issue is they're trying to write the paper from start to finish going linearly through the introduction to the methods to the result to the conclusion that's wrong that's a mistake and no wonder you're having problems instead you want to write the paper from the inside out you want to start with the methods for many of you this is actually the easiest section to write it's going to give you confidence proceeding that way so start with the methods get that done and then move into the results again this is backwards from how you may have done it before but it's going to help you avoid getting stuck it's going to help you move faster so those results you're going to simply describe in order your tables and figures and your key findings make sure that you've organized those to tell a clear and coherent story about what you want to show your readers and show the editors of the journal where you're going to send the paper the next step the third step is to actually write the conclusion so often i i see people try to write the introduction that's actually the hardest part and where you're most likely to encounter difficulty write the conclusion next now the conclusion has several components that are quite formulaic so in the first part of the conclusion you want to recapitulate your findings restate very succinctly what your keep findings were but don't go into any detail about them yet that's the first paragraph of your conclusion the second paragraph of your conclusion always said again always is the limitations and this is a really great opportunity for you to fend off reviewer criticisms by saying i anticipated that i already knew about that use these wisely i often like to do says first second third fourth just list them out make it very simple for yourself you know what those limitations are you were probably well aware of them they may have even given you nightmares before this is a chance to make them transparent get them in the open state those limitations then what you go into very simple this is very formulaic it's down to a science because of this is what are the implications for future research that's some paragraph and sun right and then what are the implications if any for policy interventions or other action in your field this may not apply to all of you but uh will likely apply to most of the fields that you're working finally now you're ready for the introduction so the introduction again is is the biggest stumbling block and it can be quite difficult but actually it's a lot like the conclusion and it doesn't need to be as difficult as we sometimes make it to be and the introduction is going to have a three-part structure the first part of your introduction you want to set out why are we having this conversation now why is your topic so important why do people care in your field or even more broadly care about it set that up that's your first first paragraph second you want to get into what is the weakness of what's been done before in this conversation what's missing you know what that is you might want to go and do a quick literature review to back up those points why the conversation is important cite the existing studies have been have been done before and what's missing from those and finally you lead right into your study the third part of your intro what is the value that your study is going to bring to the table how are you going to plug those gaps from what's before you really want to take this opportunity to articulate very clearly and succinctly what the value added of your paper is and uh finally last important thing to remember is it doesn't have to be perfect this is another uh common error students make perfect is the enemy of the good i don't care if in this first pass you vomit on the page and it's just complete excrement don't worry you're going to clean it up later think about it like climbing a mountain as you climb the mountain you slowly work your way up to the top and it might be the first pass of the paper you just dump facts and information in that's fine you've got the skeleton you've got the bones of the paper together and then as you continue climbing up that mountain you're going to continue to to polish and clean up and edit that riding so listen if you want

https://youtu.be/DFp1uGTXo4Q?si=4E0HsOOPJ-KR8fnG,Marysia,"Hey there, are you struggling with writing a thesis statement? Don’t frown, Scribbr to the rescue! Hi, I'm Jessica from Scribbr, here to help you achieve your academic goals. Are you ready to get things done? I’ll show you how to write an awesome thesis statement in 3 steps. It’s good to point out what a thesis statement does. It sums up the main point of your paper, just one or two sentences long and usually appears at the end of your introduction. Once you’ve established a thesis statement, you can keep it in mind throughout the writing process and say goodbye to going off-topic. Sounds good? Now, you only need 3 simple ingredients to cook up a great thesis statement. You need to: mention the main topic of your paper, take a position and state your argument, and summarize the evidence you’ll use to support your argument. Here we go, 3 steps to write a thesis statement. Step 1, we need to come up with a research question, so our question would be: What were the main factors that led to the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum? If you want to know how to formulate a strong research question, I have a video on that as well! Step 2, find a tentative answer to the research question you came up with in step 1. Since we’re taking an argumentative approach here, the answer should take a strong position on the topic. So something like this: Brexit was driven by political frustration. And this will be the initial thesis statement. Next, as we keep on researching, we discover more evidence and sources. So keep developing and refining your thesis statement. The final thesis statement should be elaborate, and also summarizes the overall argument. The Brexit referendum result was driven by working-class frustration with the political elite caused by austerity policies that have eroded public services and fragmented communities; the referendum offered an alternative to the status quo. Let’s examine how strong our thesis statement is. The best thesis statements are concise, disputable and coherent. Our thesis statement is concise. It builds up to a central argument, which is Brexit was driven by political frustration and leaves out other information like the consequences of Brexit. To keep it concise, avoid general and vague wordings, keep it in a sentence or two. It's also disputable. The thesis statement took a position that some might argue the other way around. It’s not a simple fact the readers will easily accept, as it requires further evidence and persuasion which encourages readers to keep reading. Our thesis statement is coherent as well. The three parts of a thesis statement; topic, position and the evidence were all well-connected and presented in a logical manner. Depending on the aim of your paper, there are different types of thesis statement you can choose from. The first type is argumentative, which is the example we used earlier. An argumentative thesis statement should take a clear position, since the goal is to persuade your reader of a claim. If you want to analyze, interpret and evaluate different aspects of a topic, then, your thesis statement should map out the key points of your analysis, and briefly introduce the conclusions you will draw from it. For example, The history of the UK’s relationship to the EU is complicated; from the beginning Britain has been reluctant to fully integrate into Europe, both economically and culturally but the politics of EU membership has changed throughout the past 50 years. Of course, your paper also could aim to explain and discuss the facts of a topic. In this case, the thesis statement should summarize the main points you’ll cover. For example, Polling and surveys shed light on the demographics of the Brexit vote, which can be broken down in terms of age, ethnicity, region, and educational level. After going through this video, you should be able to come up with a strong thesis statement for your paper now!

https://youtu.be/msaynBwwxkA?si=Gi-bfJ5fTR3Ssa_R,Marysia,"The introduction paragraph is the first part of your essay, and it's important to start strong. A great introduction grabs your reader’s interest and tells them what to expect. You can write one in 4 steps, just keep watching! Hi, I’m Jessica from Scribbr, here to help you achieve your academic goals. Step 1, hook your reader. Your first sentence sets the tone for the whole essay. This sentence is often called the “hook” because you want to catch your reader and reel them in! Avoid long, dense sentences—start with something clear, concise, and catchy that will spark curiosity. So we’re writing an essay about the history of the Braille writing system. We want to start by saying something like: Sure, that tells us what the essay’s about, but it’s a bit plain and boring. Let’s try turning it into a hook: The invention of Braille was a major turning point in the history of disability. That’s more like it—instead of just stating our topic, we’re making a bold claim about its place in history and linking it to relevant social themes. The phrase “turning point” hints at the big changes we’re going to discuss, without giving too much away just yet. What does your introduction sentence look like? Pique my interest in the comment below! I’m curious! Step 2, give background information. Next, give your reader the background they need to understand your argument. Depending on the subject of your essay, this might include: describing the historical or social context, defining key terms, introducing relevant theories or research, or setting up the different sides of a debate. But don’t overdo it here—save your evidence and interpretation for the main body of the essay. In our Braille example, we first introduce the topic: The writing system of raised dots used by visually impaired people was developed by Louis Braille in nineteenth-century France, and then sketch the social context that the essay will address: In a society that did not value disabled people in general, blindness was particularly stigmatized, and lack of access to reading and writing was a significant barrier to social participation. The idea of tactile reading was not entirely new, but existing methods based on sighted systems were difficult to learn and use. Step 3, present your thesis statement. Now it’s time to narrow your focus and show exactly what you want to say about the topic. This is your thesis statement—a sentence or two that sums up your overall argument. It’s the most important part of your introduction because it defines the focus of your whole essay. A thesis isn’t just a statement of fact but a claim that requires evidence and explanation. The goal is to clearly convey your own position in a debate or your central point about a topic and to indicate the reasoning behind it. So, the main point of our essay is to show why Braille was such an important invention. The thesis statement sums up the two stages of our argument—the innovation of a writing system made for blind people and the social changes it facilitated: As the first writing system designed for blind people’s needs, Braille was a groundbreaking new accessibility tool. It not only provided practical benefits but also helped change the cultural status of blindness. More about thesis statements in our next video on this playlist, but don't head on over just yet... We got 1 more step to go! Step 4, map your essay's structure. Particularly in longer essays, it’s helpful to end the introduction by signposting what will be covered in each part. Keep it concise and give your reader a clear sense of the direction your argument will take. In our example, we map out the three main parts of the essay: the pre-Braille situation, the development of the invention, and the consequences. This essay begins by discussing the situation of blind people in nineteenth-century Europe. It then describes the development of Braille and its gradual acceptance within blind education. Subsequently, it explores the wide-ranging effects of this invention on blind people’s social and cultural lives. By the way, even though the introduction comes at the start of your essay, you don’t have to write it first—if you’re stuck, feel free to work on the rest of the essay and come back to it later. Just make sure you’ve got your thesis statement to guide you—click this video next to learn how to write a strong one!

https://youtu.be/i5OZQQWj5-I?si=AqV68NsjuJ-xgYPS,Marysia,"In the world of stock trading, its so easy  to get overwhelmed and lost in the endless   abyss of information that s out there. There s free ebooks, paid courses, and scammy   youtubers. and its extremely hard to decipher what  s good information and what s bad information.   As someone who has had to go through  the exact same scenario myself.   (Yep that s me) I found it extremely   annoying. So that s why im making this exact  video. So you can cut out all the bullshit   and get a complete A-Z guide on how to start  trading stocks if you are complete beginner.   Now im not going to do the usual YouTuber approach  where I wrap this all up in a nice little bow and   make you pay $299 for my course. The best part of this series,   its completely free. (free realestate)   Now after trading for around 8 years, I can  say there s a lot of information we have to   swim through. My job is to go over that  information in a simplistic and efficient   way so you can understand the maximum amount  of information possible in the shortest amount   of time. That s the goal at least. Now theres a specific question I get   asked most almost every single day in my comment  section from new traders. Trader after trader   asking the same, exact, question. That question is .   How much money do I need to start trading? And my answer, might just surprise you. Is   it $100? Is it $1,000? Is it $10,000? What if I told you the answer is $0.   Let me explain. One of the biggest mistakes beginner traders make   is they just instantly jump in the market with  their life savings without any experience at all.   Just because they saw some Stock tiktok trader in  front of a lambo and thought hey that looks fun .   Considering they have no experience, they  lose all of their money, then end up saying   ahh maybe this isn t for me . Then end up  quitting, and never try to trade stocks again.   And the sad part is, this is what  happens to a majority of traders.   What I m about to tell you, is how you  can completely avoid that all together,   so this doesn t happen to you. There are devices called trading simulators   or paper trading. Which is basically a platform  where you can trade with fake money so you can   test things out. Test different strategies,  test your risk management techniques, test   controlling your emotions, or maybe you want to  test out different trading styles like shorting.   Most new traders skip this step, and  honestly its the most crucial step   out there to become a successful trader.  That s why im listing it as my very step.   There are a lot of trading simulators out  there. Some are paid, some are free. But   the one that I would recommend the most is  webull. Just because its free and they have   a really user friendly dashboard to where  its not really confusing and easy to use.   So that s what I would recommend if you want  to try one out. Plus I think they give you,   12 free shares of stock or something like  that if its your first time signing up,   so that s a good bonus as well.   Ill leave a link in my description if you  want to try out their trading simulator.   No, this video is not sponsored by webull.  I just recommend them if you don t have a   trading simulator already. But webull  if you re watching this cough cough.   So what I would recommend doing is  getting on webull, start paper trading,   and just do what you would normally do  if it was real money. But the trick is,   you have to act like this fake paper trading  money is real. Act like its your actual capital.   Put the concepts that im about to teach you in  this video series to the test. But not only that,   take it a step further. Record  every single trade you take.   If it was a losing trade. Write down what you  think you did wrong. Did you get greedy? Did you   move your stop loss? Did you let your emotions get  the best of you? Did you follow your rule set?   Record EVERYTHING. For every single trade. This way, you can look back at what you did   wrong and instantly fix it there and then. This will EXPONENTIALLY speed up the   process of you becoming a better trader. But not only that, you should record all your   winning trades as well. Write down what you think  you did right. That way, you can look back at it   and try to repeat the concepts you did right. When first starting out, you should not be   focused on the money aspect of trading at  all. You should purely be focusing on your   trading strategy, improving said strategy,  and trying to learn as much as possible.   If you do all of this, the making  money part, will just come naturally.   Doing just this, will let you pass 100,000s  of new traders on the learning curve.   This tip in itself is a game changer, im  serious, every new trader should do it.   Thats my first step, on how to start trading  stocks a complete beginner. I was thinking about   making this a video series, where we go completely  from A-Z on how to become a successful trader.   This is going to include everything. Risk  management, trading psychology, chart setups,   market structure, candle stick patterns, trading  strategies, everything. A-Z. Beginning to end.   Everything you need know as a beginner trader.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nnndhSc4iw,Josy," Hey guys, so as promised, here's how to sing better instantly. Run, run, lost boy, they say to me. Now I know exactly where you guys are coming from. You're starting off, you're searching around trying to find the right video on YouTube that's going to teach you exactly what you need to know to take your voice to that next level. I know because I was where you are. When I'm a love the woman. I was not good at all. I needed to figure out exactly how to improve my voice. Years later, here's where I'm at. So I'm going to give you guys a condensed version right here of how to take your voice right now to the next level. I want actionable items that you guys can use. The first thing that's definitely going to show you a difference is finding where your voice sits. So for a lot of people, they don't really know how they should be using their voice and what strain-free singing feels like. As a singer that is now able to sing with more freedom, I look back and I realize that when I was singing with a lot more strain, I didn't even realize that that level of strain was actually straining. I felt like that was normal, like that was actually what singing should feel like. So before we do anything else, we first have to get a baseline of what free voice use feels like. So what I want you to do is something that everybody can do. It's just sigh with your mouth closed. Almost like you're thinking pondering about something, telling me we all do, hmm, how does your voice feel as you make that sound? Feels pretty simple, right? Pretty easy. This is not rocket science, it's not a super high note or being held out or a runner. It's none of those very complex things, but it's voice use and does it feel natural, clean, good, strain-free, all of those good things, then you're in the right place. If you want to sing with more confidence and power, then you have to sign up for my lesson subscription. You get two group lessons with me personally every single week. You get access to all my courses and you get access to recordings of all my one-on-one lessons with my students. That will help you learn vicariously through them.

You may not even realize that you're doing that, but it's a glissando. It's where we take one note and we slide through many other notes downwards. And we're doing that glissando downwards. So what you want to do is take that, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, and just find a note where your voice just rests at that spot. hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, and just let your voice kind of be light, free, as easy as that sigh. You don't want to start going hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, and trying to force things to happen. Let it be as easy as that gentle sigh that you started with. Now I want you to take that sigh and I want you to find that note that your voice generally tries to land on. You'll notice that there always be a note that your voice favors as you come down where it feels like it's kind of resonating the most, feels the easiest to create. So find where your note is as you slide down, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, might be one of those notes around there. Try to find where your voice feels most comfortable, let's do it again, hmm, hmm, hmm, so that one feels a little bit on the low side for me. So let's try it again, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, okay. Slide around a little bit, just try to find it, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, so that right there feels like it's pretty easy for me, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, lifted so it's not down there where I feel like I'm kind of sitting on my throat like it feels a little bit pushed that's what we'd want to avoid so we don't want to feel pushed as we're creating it want to create a nice easy feel as we do it now as you find that note I want you to just drop your jaw let your mouth open hmm now as you drop your jaw you want to avoid things like don't want to do that we don't want to go no don't want to do that we don't want to do that either we want to try to keep it as close to the way the hum was we're just dropping the jaw the reason why I point all these things out is because you'd be surprised how many people end up making those other sounds where you're probably laughing yourself like how could you possibly be making that sound again two thousands of people out there that are trying this video right now are sounding like that so now that I hopefully you found that nice easy flow from the hum to the open mouth position we're just going to try a phrase of a song choose any phrase of any song that you want to sing I'm just going to pick one that's not going to be copy right it here so I'm just going to run with the Canadian national anthem let's roll with that so I want you to just go to that hum our home and native land and you want to try to feel like the words are an extension of that same relaxed chilled hum that you created initially now you might be saying to yourself wait Adam that is not the pitch that I need to sing this song at what are you doing well right now I'm just trying to get you to I mean most of you are beginners out there I'm trying to get you to feel what it's like to create a release sound because for many of you if you're anything like what I started out to be you're creating sounds that are totally not released totally not relaxed you don't even realize it you need to be able to find what is a relaxed released state and then from there try to take that into the range that you're trying to sing your songs at so does this mean that you should always sing your songs low no it does not but what it does mean is that we need to find that relaxed feeling and take it throughout any part of our range so this idea of singing very chilled very relaxed very easy not with strain needs to be carried out throughout your voice now the next question you're probably asking yourself but wait Adam does all singing need to be this relax and this chilled well no because if you're belting a high note you're not going to be as relaxed as it's not gonna be like that because there you're going to be using a lot more breath pressure you're gonna be using a lot more intensity so if you're creating it sound like there is much more intensity behind that you need to engage your abdominals you need to use your vocal chords properly so that they hold back the air flow in the right way but at the same time it's not something where you're gonna feel a lot of tension happening here so it's not gonna sound feel like which a lot of people feel like as they're singing there's a whole bunch of exterior tension doesn't feel clean nice and easy in the throat so the amount of ease in the throat is going to be the same as this hmm we want to get that exact same sort of feeling in the throat as we're singing no matter what we're singing now I'm gonna move on to the next step but if you already feel some strain creeping in and it doesn't feel as relaxed as that initial hum then it's time to stop the video right now and practice with that a lot more until that becomes much easier for you to do you have to be able to take this progression step by step without ever engaging more strain in your throat so make sure that you've got that strain free before you start jumping into this next step the next step is playing around with different pitch variations in the song that you're working on so the phrase that you're working on you want to try to bring the pitch up you want to try to bring the pitch down and see what changes as I adjust that pitch so if we start off with that same one I started off with before now I can try pitching that up now I can try pitching it down and then I can try pitching it up even higher so there you go guys as promised how to take your voice step by step and improve it immediately now there is is going to be an immediate difference for many of you but this is something that you can still practice with and get the hang of over time and it will get better and better as you're able to carry it to different pitch levels in your voice if you found this video helpful then you

https://youtu.be/I9unIJnobQU?si=xvgR4OPlaIPEGlOL,Marysia,"Imagine you were a brand new trader, fresh out of the womb, and you wanted to learn how to make money trading stocks just like the big boys, but you wanted just one place, one video series, to learn absolutely everything—no bulls, just pure knowledge—A-Z, every topic, a complete blueprint on how to learn the market from a complete beginner’s perspective. Well, that’s what you’re watching right now. Yeah, you clicked it. I posted a video a couple weeks ago titled How to Start Trading Stocks as a Complete Beginner. In that video, I said if it got 1,000 likes, I would make this a complete series and teach you guys everything I know from start to finish, and let’s just say you guys got the video to 1,000 likes—actually, you got it to 1,000 likes within 20 minutes! So that shows you guys have a huge interest in this video series. I’m a man of my word, and that’s why I’m making this video. This is part 2 of the series. Let’s not waste any time; let’s get straight to it. First things first, we need to go over some common trading terminology. Us traders have these common vocab words that mean specific trading terms. It’s almost like a secret handshake in a way, but if you’re a new trader, you definitely have to know what these terms mean, especially if you’re going to watch this series, because I’m going to say them all the time. First term is long. To put it very, very, very simply: when you are long on a stock, that means you make money as the chart is going up. So, if you buy a stock at $10, that means you are in a long position, and if it goes to $20, you made money. Pretty simple. The complete opposite of that is a short. A short is when you make money as the chart goes down. Again, I’ll try to explain this as simply as possible. Essentially, what you’re doing is this: say the price is at $10. You then ask your broker, “Hey, can I borrow 5 shares of stock at $10? I promise I’ll give it back.” They say, “Yeah, sure, why not, homie.” So, you now have $50 worth of short shares (5x10). What you want is the price to go down because if the price goes down to, say, $5, you can then buy back 5 shares at $5, totaling $25. So, you got the 5 shares of stock cheaper than what you borrowed them for. You then do a little switcharoo, give the shares back to the broker just like you said you would, and keep the rest of the profit. So in this scenario, you would have made $25. Hopefully, that makes sense. Big picture: long positions make money as the chart goes up, and short positions make money as the chart goes down. Next is bulls and bears. If you’re completely new, you’ve probably heard traders say this before and thought to yourself, “Why are there animals in the stock market?” Yeah, it’s weird, I know, but it’s the lingo. Basically, if you’re a bull, that means you think the market is going to go up in the future or you take long trades. So oftentimes, you’ll hear, “Oh, there’s good market news today, I’m bullish.” If you’re a bear, that means you think the market is going to go down or you take short trades. An easy way to remember this is when a bull charges at you, they swing their horns upwards. When a bear claws at you, it goes downwards. See? You’re a professional trader already. Next, we’ll talk about the spread, and this is when it starts getting really juicy. In trading, there are basically two main prices: the bid and the ask. The bid and ask refer to the prices at which buyers and sellers are willing to trade a stock. The bid price is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a stock, while the ask price is the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept for the same stock. For example, if a stock has a bid price of $10 and an ask price of $11, this means a buyer is willing to pay up to $10 for the stock, while a seller is willing to sell the stock for at least $11. The difference between the bid and ask prices is called the spread, which represents everything in the middle. Oftentimes, when you watch professional traders during live streams, they’ll have this moving data on their screen, and it makes them look really cool and professional. Well, this data is called level II data, and these moving numbers are the bids and asks. The numbers on the left are the bids. So, as you can see here, the highest price someone is willing to buy this stock at is this price, and this number is the amount of shares they want to buy. The numbers on the right are the ask prices. This number right here is the lowest amount someone is willing to sell this stock at. The amount between these two numbers is the spread. While we’re on this topic, let’s talk about the different types of orders. When purchasing or selling a stock, there are different ways you can do it. I’m going to go over 4. There are more order types than this, but these are the main 4 you should know. There’s market, limit, stop, and stop loss. A market order is you basically saying, “I want the stock right now.” No matter what the ask price is, you want the broker to instantly buy the stock at whatever the stock is right now. The pros of a market order are that you know for sure you’ll be in the trade no matter what, but the con of that pro is you’re essentially paying a premium because you’re buying that stock for whatever the ask price is right now. Next is a limit order. A limit order is you basically saying, “If the stock hits this price, I want to buy it.” So, say, for example, a share of stock is at $50. You can put a buy limit order for $40. That means your broker will only purchase that stock once the price goes down to $40. Once it hits $40, it’ll purchase it automatically. The pros of a limit order are that you’re essentially getting the stock at a cheaper price, but the con of that pro is you may not get filled because there are going to be scenarios where the price doesn’t go down to your limit order, and you’ll miss out on the trade. Next is a stop order. A stop order is kind of the opposite of a limit order. Essentially, a buy stop order is you saying, “You only want to enter a trade if the stock goes up to a certain price.” For example, if you have a stock consolidating or moving sideways in a range and the top of this range is at $50, and you only want to enter into this stock once it breaks that range at $55, you would create a buy stop order for $55. Once the price breaks this range and reaches $55, your broker will then purchase the stock. Next is the 4th and final order type, which is the stop loss order, and this is arguably the most important one. Unlike the 3 other orders where it enters you into a trade, a stop loss takes you out of the trade. So, say the price is at $50. You’re in the trade, but you say to yourself, “If the price ever goes down to $40, I don’t want to be in the trade anymore.” Well, what you would do is set a stop loss at $40. If the price ever goes down to that point, your broker will automatically exit for you. So, little recap: a market order is you want to buy the stock right now, no matter the price. You want to enter instantly. A limit order is you want to enter if the price goes down to a certain price. A stop order is the opposite of a limit order, and you want to enter if the price goes up to a certain price. And a stop loss is you want to exit if the price goes down to your stop loss. Now, like I said, it can get a little more complicated than this, but for the sake of this video, these are the 4 order types you should know. These are the absolute basics, but it’s kind of that one thing that’s a little boring, but it’s one of those things we had to go over. To be honest, if this series was an A-Z series, we haven’t even really passed B yet. My goal with this series is to slowly get more and more advanced as we progress throughout the series so that by the time we get to the Z video, you’re basically Einstein when it comes to trading. So, since you guys smashed the 1,000-like goal last video, let’s make this video’s goal 5,000 likes. If we get this video to 5,000 likes, I will upload episode 3, and we’ll get a little bit more advanced and start looking at some actual setups. Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you guys next time.",How To Start Trading Stocks As A Complete Beginner - Ep.2,27.02.2023,TradingLab,Man,30s,08:37,10,"0,998"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf71rCWNVIM,Josy," Yo, do le, I don't know, yo, do le, I don't know. Hey y'all, welcome to your very first yodeling lesson. This is the video where you're gonna learn the perfect way to annoy your neighbors. No, just kidding. My name is Cassidy, and I have been yodeling since I was nine or 10 years old. It is so much fun, and I'm glad that you wanna learn how to do it too. This series is gonna be all about teaching you the basics of how to yodel, and that way you can do crazy fancy things down the line, like, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel. Today's video is gonna be focusing on breaking your voice. So what is yodeling? Yodeling is going from your chest voice to your head voice really rapidly, and that creates the breaking or cracking sound that you hear when people yodel. Your chest voice is your normal everyday voice, like, eh, and your head voice is your falsetto voice. You know, your upper voice, eh, and when you yodel, you switch between those really fast. The first exercise I'm gonna do is learning how to make the, eh, sound. I think there are a couple of different easy ways to learn how to break your voice. The first one is just pressing going from that chest voice to your head voice slowly, and you can separate the two notes, just to kind of get it into your mind. Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, and then slowly speed it up and try to blend the two notes together, so it's one smooth movement. Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, and then don't even think about it. Overthinking it is gonna make it so much harder, just relax and try to let your voice naturally move into that higher register. You can also try just kind of gliding your voice up to falsetto, like, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, sometimes that's a little bit easier and you'll hear that break. And then we also wanna learn how to do that with the O sound. O, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, and then just speed it up until you get rid of that separation between the two notes and you break your voice into the falsetto. O, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, you can also try it once again, gliding up into that higher register. O, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, I realize my face, I'm probably making really funny faces right now. Then once you master those two different sounds, A, O, you can combine them in one. And once you've mastered those two sounds, you can put them into one yodel like this. Yodelay, yodeloo, yodelay, yodelay, yodeloo, yodelay, yodeloo. You're saying yodelay, yodeloo, yodelay, yodeloo. And just those two breaking sounds. And those are the sounds that you're going to need to know if you want to start doing fancy yodels. Alright, so I think that that's it for this episode of How To Yodel. I hope that you'll take these trips and tricks and you can learn how to yodel too. On this channel, I'm going to be posting more of my original songs and yodeling songs. So if you like what you see here, you can subscribe and you can hit the bell for notifications.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0uXGQu55GM,Josy," I have spent the last decade of my life immersing myself in the field of finance and money through a degree in finance, a qualification in accounting, and then a career in investment banking. And one of the most life-changing skills I have learned through at all is how to handle my own finances, recognize my bad money habits, and break free from them. So in this video, I'm going to share with you nine of the most common bad money habits that hold people back and tips on how to break out of them. Number one, paying yourself last. I first heard of this in the book, Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, and it's one of the blueprints in achieving financial freedom. Robert explains that the way people pay their bills can be broken down into two types. The first way is the poor people's habit, and that is through paying yourself last. So as soon as your paycheck comes in, you then pay your rent, your phone bill, your subscriptions, you find your social plans, and then you'll say whatever's left over if there is even any money left to save. The second method he talks about is the rich people's habit, and they do the complete opposite. They pay themselves first, and that is what you want to do. Take 10% minimum and put that into your savings account the minute you get paid. Treat it like paying a bill. This is so important, and by doing this, you're guaranteeing that that money will be saved and won't just slip through your fingers through spending. A lot of people are probably thinking there is no way I can do this I live paycheck to paycheck, but the surprising thing is when you take that 10% and put it away, your mind will think of ways and structure your spending and structure your finances to last for the whole month, and you won't even realise that you're saving in the background. People don't realise how much they're spending on paying the bills, buying something new, going on that weekend away, and then they save whatever's left, but that is the backwards mentality the key is to pay yourself first instead of making other people richer by buying their things before you pay yourself. The second bad money habit is getting comfortable with bad debt. It seems that debt these days is actually the norm. People are using debt to buy the smallest of things, to buy presents, to buy clothes. I have a straight rule that is unless I can afford to pay for that thing outright and cash, I shouldn't be buying it with any form of debt. Remember credit card companies want you to be bad with your finances because that's how they make money from this. The average credit card interest rate is 22%, which cancels all kinds of benefits and rewards these credit card companies are providing if you're not able to pay them off in time. It is not having a stockpile. This ties into point number one, which is about paying yourself first and essentially it's saving enough so that you have a buffer behind you of about three to six months. This is super important and it will give you peace of mind just by having this buffer kept to one side and available to tap into if you need it. You free up that mental energy to designate two more important things. So how do you gather this six months of buffer is through that paying yourself first. Start putting that 10% away and once you have your stockpile, then you can start using the additional money you saved to building into your investment fund and looking at investments. Number four is not knowing your income or expenses properly until you know what your starting point is. How do you know where you want to be? There's something called lifestyle inflation and that is your spending rise as your income rises. The more money you make, the more you spend and it's a cycle. Make more money by a bigger house, buy a nicer car, spend more, make more and it's crazy how normal this is but it is a recipe for disaster. You want to be in control of your finances and mapping out where things are going. A budget tracker is super important and you want it to include how much you're making, how much you're paying yourself first. That 10% we spoke about your expenses, so your bills, your mortgage, your rent, your spending, your debt repayments and so on and you want to be keeping on top of that budget tracker. At least every three months, set a date night with the tracker. People who know exactly where they are financially, they know their assets, they know their liabilities, they have a clear goal on where they want to go financially and all the steps they need to take to get there are more likely to get a lot of money and build wealth compared to people who just fantasise about money but have no idea how to go about it, how they plan to acquire it or how to manage it. Just being mindful of this stuff and seeing those numbers in black and white will trigger you into action. Fifth bad money habit is having expensive hobbies. A lot of people like to shop and I guess yeah, part of this is retail therapy but again, marketing, social media and these multi-billion pound organizations love to tell us how much we need to spend our money and spend our cash instead of keeping and investing it. Next up we have focusing purely on saving. If you want to improve your financial position, you can firstly save more of your existing income or you can make more money and create more income streams and the ideal combination is a mixture of both. You can't build wealth if you're making more money and spending it all but you also can't if you're just focusing on the saving side because there is a cap to how much you can save. Using those cash back sites will only get you so far. So to truly build wealth, you have to think of both sides of the equation, both how you will save a larger percentage of your income but also how you will make more money. Saving money side has a cap, the making money side does not. It's infinite. There is unlimited potential upside, whether it's investing in the stock market, asking for a pay rise, starting a side hustle, you want to break the bad money habit of thinking that saving money is going to massively increase your wealth. Number seven, paying too much in taxes. Taxes are going to be the single biggest expense in your life. Whilst everyone has to pay tax, a lot of people just pay it without considering how you can legally reduce your bill legally is the key word to. The wealthy, they have knowledge of illegal corporate structures that come with tax advantages. They hire tax advisors that help them minimize their tax bills. So if you want to get one step ahead, one of the best ways to increase your wealth is to understanding tax rules in a way that stack up in your favor. For example, investing through an ISA or a Roth IRA, which is an investment account that shelters your dividend and profit from taxes or operating under a business instead of an individual if you're a solar printer. All of this stuff is absolutely legal and if you are someone who disagrees with this and prefers to pay more taxes regardless of whether or not you can reduce it legally, then it doesn't hurt to understand the tax rules and reduce that tax bill so that you can instead use the money to give back to things that directly align with your values instead of letting someone else decide where that money should be going. If you want me to make a video on tax, I was planning to. I already have a summary on why I want to include but I have been a bit skeptical about whether to release this. It's a topic that can go either way. So let me know in the comments below if you want to see that. Number eight, waiting too long to invest. When you start having savings, you have that stockpile, that buffer that we spoke about. Then you want to start looking at investing that money so that your money starts working for you and you want to diversify those investments. So you can weather different situations that come around in life but you want to avoid leaving that money in a bank account because inflation is a thing and it means that you're essentially losing money every year. So I have a mixture of safe investments of riskier investments that I'm willing to lose as well. Start looking at different investment strategies once you've saved up enough. Don't leave any additional money more than you need to in a bank account. I have another video and what you can be doing with your money in times like the current recession and I'll link that here for you as well. There's always going to be reasons why you can't invest because you don't have time. You don't have enough money. You don't know where to start but the longer you pit off investing, the harder you will have to work to get that same level of financial freedom as someone who starts investing earlier. I just be finding the right person or the right tools that help you resonate with your finances in a way that most appeals to you whether that's through an employee perspective or an entrepreneur perspective. Someone who is a less of a risk taker, someone who is more of a risk taker but there will be someone who kind of matches your investing style more closely. Thank you so much for watching.

Number one is overworking. The problem that you're working from home, that is, you don't know what you're doing and what you're doing. It's very important as you start working from home. You just need to be able to get your mindset. Let's say, 8 to 5, 9 to 5, after 5 o'clock. No, you stop. You don't have to be on time. So, that's number one. There's a tendency of overworking. And there's also a tendency that also overworking from home base or underworking. When you say underworking, since comfortable, you can use 11 to 12. And then, you can use Netflix if you're working on content. You don't know what you're doing. You're just being honest. So, there are two sides of the coin. Either you overwork or you underwork. So, again, it's all about building routine, building habit and building discipline in order for you to succeed when you want to work from home. So, right now, let's talk about opportunities. Opportunities that we're seeing. Number one, what are the best things that you can get into? You want to start home base or without a doubt, go into sailing. Sailing like for example, real estate insurance. They're going to direct sailing. Because, you know, the first thing that you need to do is to get a wife. And, you need to get a wife. You need to get an immediate income when you want to start your own home base business. Maybe you're asking why. Because the goal you need to get into your encounter, you need to get an opportunity. It's not to earn money, but to earn and gain experience. To earn and gain confidence. Listen. Listen. So, what do you need to do? The money will follow if you learn how to sell. Because, you know, we want to invent something. But, imagine this. Sailing is a new skill that you have to acquire unless you're looking for a woman. Because, imagine what you were trained to become an accountant. You were trained to become an engineer. Or, probably, you were trained to become a nurse. And, all of a sudden, switched profession. So, I'll go to sales in zero knowledge, zero experience, zero exposure. So, you need to give yourself at least six months to one year. Six months to one year to learn. To learn not to earn. Anyway, the thing you need to do is to get your job. Do this as your part-time and sideline inside the hustle. That's number one. Number two. If you're going to get a job, you can say, she's going to get a face-to-face. And, I'm going to say face-to-face selling is the online selling. We've been planning to sell online. She's going to shop. She's going to take the Facebook Marketplace. But, you can get a product and start promoting it online. And, the good thing about the online selling, of course, is that, overhead, social media, posting, not just the market, but open 24-7. Not just that. So, a third opportunity, guys, you can get a free-lancing. I'm sure, if you're looking for a marketing, a graphic design, social media management, or ads, you can get a lot of things online and offer free-lancing services online. I think you need to get a job. You need to get a job. You need to get a job. You need to get a job. You need to get a job. You need to get an organization. You need to get an opportunity. Or, if that, another opportunity online tutorial services. You can get a free-lancing virtual assistant. You need an administrator, a secretary, assistant, and a schedule. So, if you're looking for an opportunity, and you're looking for an opportunity, maybe right now you're asking, okay, I'm solving the idea. I like all your ideas, but how do I start? Okay, so if you want to start this, what you need to do? Number one, identify your strength and capability. In your own way, that's where we all start. If you're looking for an opportunity, I have the gift of some taking something that's very complicated and make it very simple for people to understand. I have a gift. I have a problem, right? I have a problem. I have a problem. I have a problem. I have a problem. So, if you want to be part of my coaching group, I give also group coaching and one-on-one coaching session.

All you need to do is just go to chinkfree.com, CHINK, frie.com, and you can also get the link to own group coaching or personal coaching. Just fill up the form.

And then from there, you create already your product and services that you want to offer. That's where you start. Simple. What do you think? What you're good at, target market, is that after that problem, pain point solution, after that, you create the product to be able to help your target market. That's it, pancit. And then, of course, some of you are saying, chinky, you're going to get a job, but you're going to get a job. Because we don't know how long it will take to get a job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaO1uCd-gLY,Josy," The number one reason that students don't get upgrades is because they don't study. Obviously, but the number one reason that students don't study is because studying just takes too long and I still remember despising school and hoping that my teachers wouldn't announce a new test. Because if they announced a new test, that would mean more studying. And studying meant having to sit down on the weekends and spend hours upon hours doing something that I didn't want to do. It felt so boring, tedious and daunting. And you know procrastination is actually caused by this daunting feeling. So by learning how to study fast. I slowly rewrite it studying from sign-line despise and I always hated to do. So I think that would take lots of time. The sign-line has a quick and easy and simple. And since I started to be studying on that way, I ended up procrastinating less and I got better and better results. And I could have met before, I'm Steven, also known as Jigsbok, and I got this set of perfect results in my GCSEs. But the key is I was able to do this while studying little so that I had time to do all these other things. And I'm going to teach you how to do the exact same. The first way to study faster is to manage your expectations. That was a study done and there were two groups of people that were followed. One group of these people associated aging with illness. And they'd like, they'd have beliefs such as, I'm going to age so poorly, when I age my skin's going to become more like, ring please, just going to be like, diseases like bad stuff like negativity, right? Whereas one group had a more positive outlook on aging. They had a more, it is what it is like when I live my best life. And like, you know, I'm actually going to take care of myself and you know that aging's no longer going to be that bad. And the crazy part is that the group who expected to age poorly actually did. They went to look at the hospital more frequently. They literally had like a worse quality of life when they did tests like they were more parents get their diseases, they had worse skin. Whereas the group with the positive outlook, age well, and they actually did end up living their best life. Expectations are powerful. It literally has an effect on your wellbeing and health when it comes to like the aging. And so your expectations when it comes to studying can actually dictate how long it takes. And since whenever I sat down to study on those weekends, I'd always be like, oh man, I'm just going to take forever. I'm just going to take hours. I'm going to be so boring. My study sessions ended up taking hours and actually being boring. This time you sit down, use this framework, say out loud, this task or like whatever it is, so pass papers, studying, etc. This is only going to take X amounts of time. Easy. And as crazy as it sounds, when you start a task with this positive outlook and you tell us off that we'll only take like a certain amount of time. As opposed to, oh my god, this is going to take so much time, you end up finding ways to do something. Click up. You're more focused and you'll be more efficient. As David Robson said, by changing your perception, you can change the way you are. And if you're tired of just being average and school feeling tedious and you just feel like you're not making enough progress, it just all starts with a change. I used to be kind of mediocre average until I made a change and that led me to get these results. But you can't get this without knowing what to change. And there's so much that you need to learn, especially if you want to study fast like I did because I needed to have the time to do all these other things that I still love. So if you want to learn how to study efficiently, you want to learn how to become a top student or aspects, get the extra curriculers, build up an impressive portfolio. It all starts with learning how to be productive, how to be efficient. And these are all things that I teach you in this free study master class. So make sure to check that out first link in the description. It's completely free. Anyway, back to the video. The second chapter is you're doing too much. Imagine your reminder and you're looking for gold. You dig and dig and dig. But most of the time you find it's just regular dust. However, in a small part of the mind, you discover a huge vein of gold. That small area is what gave you most of your wealth, right? That's the 8020 rule. In studying, there are certain concepts like gold. They're worth more than others. And you can find these gold nuggets, which isn't found everywhere. They're only found in certain areas. And when you focus your study time on those areas, you're going to end up getting so much more better results. You don't have to take everywhere to find treasure. You need to focus on the right spots. The main reason that studying takes a lot of time is because she spent time studying everything. But let me tell you something. Let me make this a rule. From now on, you should only be spending time studying areas that are your weak points or areas that will be tested heavily in exams. Suddenly, you're not having to spend time on your strong points because that's the most fun part of the revision because you're going to get all this stuff, right? You've got to not actually learn anything new. And when your revise, you need to study the areas that will come up in the exams. And so when you study heavy weights topics in the exams, you know you can bag yourself the most marks. And this 8020 rule can also be applied in the context of how you study. During your study sessions, 20% of what you do actually gives you 80% of the results. And then the remaining 80% of that really actually gives you 20% of the results. And so it makes sense to only focus on 20%. Especially when we're trying to study fast. The way to find out what parts of your study session are the most important is to ask this one question. If I only had two hours a week to study for whatever subject that you're trying to study for, what would it look like? It may seem like a ludicrish and it might seem like a ludicrish and it might seem like a ludicrously short amount of time since you might be used to multiple hour long study sessions per day. But once you answer yourself this question, you naturally categorise the most important and non-important parts of your study sessions. For me, before I optimise my study sessions, it would contain a lot of relearning. I'd reread textbooks, I reread notes and then I'd review and then finally I'd test. If I had only two hours a week to study for that subject, I'd focus on just doing past papers because actually getting familiar with the exam structure and getting to know what kind of questions might come up is far more valuable than actually relearning because you're not trying to relearn everything when it comes to exam. It's called revising for a reason. It's not relearning. And the common thing that a lot of students say when I advocate for you to do past papers is I can't just do past papers, so I'm not actually learning anything. But studies prove that you actually learn most through your mistakes. And so when you do papers and you get stuff wrong and you review the mistakes, that's more of an efficient learning than all the other study techniques put together. It's not study or revision if you're not making mistakes and so you should focus your time on that. And the third tip is to put a timer on. This is a kind of a unique tip, but try timing your study sessions when you do them. There's many reasons for this. Firstly, when you have a time in front of you, you're acutely aware of how much time is spending on the study session. And so you see that if you've been studying for like an hour already, you know how much time has elapsed and you know if you need to speed up or slow down. Also, studies actually prove that when you're time doing something, humans are just naturally inclined to try and get it done in the least amount of time possible. That's why speed runs exist, right? And also when you have a time run, you can also start to set targets. I want to get this task done in one hour. And when one hour passes, you know if you've been efficient or not. And that's why when you climb mountains, there's checkpoints by like an hour 14, you want to get to the checkpoint 8, checkpoint beat. And imagine instead of that, you just said you wanted to get to the top of mountain by four days time. During those four days, you wouldn't know if your pace is correct or not. You can start to do the same with study. When I used to study poorly, I would never tell myself how long I'd be there. I just say I need to study. And so I ended up spending the whole day there 8 hours. And as we talked about, my brain started associating studies sessions to be 8 hours long, right? And so I dreaded it and that led to procrastination. But the trick is to always set the time that you're going to use to study. To be saying that's unrealistic, realistic. Parkinson's law says that your task will always fill the dedicated time that you give it. So actually, although one hour might be unrealistic, then you might think, oh my god, there's no way I can finish this in one hour. I used to think this as well, but when I actually start to play games in one hour or two hours to do the task, that normally takes 8 hours. You'd be surprised I actually found that I could get it done in that amount of time. Never underestimate efficiency, the flow state, and getting things done in the least amount of time. Don't believe me? Set up the time of your next study session, and you'll be surprised about how efficient you are. And if you like this video, you probably like learning from me. And so if you want to make sure that your student years are the best they can be, you want to get the top grades like I've done, you might want to check out this student accelerator. It's where me and experts help you become the best student you can be, with exclusive courses, workshops and life course, the value there is immense.

https://youtu.be/uFbD8BAJdhA?si=pWdnfYOLF6MOsRRv,Marysia,the truth is anybody can make money online in 2024 doesn't matter your age your race or where you're located in today's video we're going to be talking specifically about different ways to make money online for different age groups so without wasting any time let's just hop into it okay so today we'll be looking at the following age groups 13 and under 14 to 17 18 to 25 and 26 and over so let's start off with the youngest group ages 13 and under at this age group you may think that it's impossible to make money online that's not really true it may be difficult to receive payment through different processors such as Shopify payments or PayPal things like that however there are a couple ways that you can make money that are a little bit unconventional one way would be to freelance thumbnails cover arts or different clips for social media creators this way doesn't require you to have you know a formalized bank account you could do this with something as simple as a cash app which I believe becomes available at ages 12 plus you may need a parent to help you sign up but you can receive payment if you don't know what freelancing thumbnails and clips and cover arst essentially that's when you find different content creators and you you know learn how to make either thumbnails or make different short form Clips or make Channel banners and art and things like that you could do that using apps such as pix art or you know uh canva or even cap cut and you can make thumbnails you can create clips and reach out to you know small to medium level creators and say hey I made you this clip hey I made you this thumbnail how do you like it I can make work like this in the future and yeah as long as you have something like a cash app to accept the payment you're good to go so now that we went over to the youngest group let's start getting into the older folks now let's talk about ages 14 to 17 at this age group you have you know a bunch more responsibilities you're able to do a lot more things I would recommend that for ages 14 to 17 your main focus should be growing an online presence now if you say Kyle I'm not the one to be you know a YouTuber or a twitch streamer you know I don't want to be in the camera I don't want to be in the spotlight that's fine there are ways for you to do so that don't require you to be in the spotlight however the most profitable way to make money in this age group would be starting your own YouTube channel Tik Tok account Instagram account and growing that I do have other videos talking about how to grow an Instagram account I have not made a video talking about how to grow on Tik Tok and YouTube yet but that will be coming soon you could of course freelance thumbnails and clips like the younger folks that can also make you a lot of money if you do it properly if you do it really nice and efficiently and very professionally and yeah at this group you are also able to start using things like Shopify if you have a parent to sign up for you so you know if you want to do things like reselling on Shopify Drop Shipping selling actual products like physical products you can do that if you have someone that can help you sign up for that account but yeah that's what you know I would say for the people ages anywhere from 14 to 17 all right so moving into the next age group we have 18 to 26 so that 26 age isn't a hard age it can be 25 it can be 28 but 27 it can be anywhere in that range but once you turn 18 you have access to way more payment processors you can use PayPal of course you can use cash app of course which you know you can use if you were younger too but you can use Shopify payments without having a parent set it up for you so the number one way to make content or you know I just leaked it the number one way to make money online I would still recommend be making your own content that is hands down the best way the most profitable way to make money on you know online in 2024 however now you are able to do Shopify Drop Shipping which is super efficient I have tons of videos posted about that click my last video it's SE it's like it's a long video but you can watch that and it talks about Drop Shipping in depth um also you can start doing remote work so that's something really cool once you you know over the ages of 18 and also you can do freelancing you know you can also do the thumbnails you can do the Clips if you want to do that as well uh they kind of Stack up so anything I mentioned in the last tier this older tier can also do the things in the Young teers but you know I'm just talk as we get older and older you have more you know availability of things you can do so this group I would emphasize doing something like Drop Shipping because it's also very profitable if you're not the person to be in the spotlight or if you're not the person to you know try to run and grow on social media totally fine Drop Shipping something like that would probably be my second recommended second most recommended you know hustle that you try out and yeah man give it a go and see how see how it ends up for you man so now we're going to move into our last a age group this is going to be people ages you know 27 plus um like I said this isn't like a super hard age group but you know if you were any of the other groups you can also do things that are in here so for people ages 27 and up I would say something like either consulting or coaching is really good if you have something that you're really good at if you have a skill you know if you have a talent you can you know consult and help people learn how to do that skill using different sites like UD Demi teachable um patreon school.com and like teach something that you're you know if you feel like you're really good at something that people would want to learn um also you can do remote jobs a lot of remote jobs like to hire people in the you know the older age groups because you know they feel like they have more life experience so you can do something like that as well you can look on sites like indeed to look for online you know uh online project management jobs remote remote corporate jobs things like that also you can do blogging blogging isn't really too popular with the younger Generations so people that are a little bit older usually do have that down packed um I would definitely check out blogging because you can get paid from having different ads and stuff on your site so that's that's definitely really cool if you want to look into that also if you're you know a little bit older that doesn't mean that you can't do anything that I mentioned before you of course can you know do content creation freelancing e-commerce you can do all of those things however these are just things that you might be a little bit more inclined to do since it requires a little bit more experience or you know just overall life experience to get into so I try to give y'all like your own sector of stuff you feel what I'm saying and that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about in this video man if you would like a more indepth video for each age group please comment down below as I mentioned if you want to learn how to you know resell products or if you want to learn how to you know grow an Instagram theme page click the links in the

You see, I'm currently following an approach that I've learned from the Internet's go-to expert for real productivity advice, who is none other than Stanford Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman and Andrew Huberman and Andrew Huberman. And some of his learning tips have made people say, Why has that not been incorporated into our educational system? And speaking of the education system, currently I'm in the final year of my undergrad and it's definitely been a challenge to balance all the content with everything else in life. So that's why I want to test out this popular and scientifically grounded system that Andrew Huberman talks about for learning faster. And at the end, I'll let you know which parts I found the most useful. Okay, so if someone gave you the option of learning 10 times faster, you probably wouldn't mind. Well, the way that Huberman says we can actually achieve this is through a very sophisticated process called doing nothing. Okay, so that's not entirely wrong, but the more scientific name is called the gap effect. And here's it explained by the man himself. Anytime you're learning something, it pays to have random intervals in which you stop and do nothing. Okay, so I've been trying this out recently and Huberman gives the rough number of doing around a set of these for every hour. But I felt like if I had to consciously count how many of these breaks I do, then they'll end up being more distracting than it would be useful. And at the same time, I didn't want to use any of those apps that do this for you. I think there's some out there, but that seems like it's more complicated than it needs to be. So what I ended up doing was I would just keep working, working, working until I naturally like slow down. And then I'll just take one of these 10 second breaks. And the thing is for me, and most likely you as well, is that these 10 second breaks is something we probably do unconsciously anyways. So it's not like we need to put in all this extra effort to force ourselves to take these little breaks. Now you know that staring at the window isn't always a bad thing. Now, I don't want to oversimplify things. These gap effects are just one part of the learning system that Huberman talks about. And altogether, they can help us learn much more quicker. And so the first step in this approach is get alert. And there's lots of ways of doing this, but one way Huberman recommends is taking around 25 deep breaths. Okay, on a serious note, I've been trying this out for some time now. And I don't see you think that the effects aren't that noticeable for me. Because if I'm tired, I'll just usually go for a walk or some exercise. Because I feel like that's the best way for me, at least, to become alert and actually focus on what I'm doing. But I can see how this can be helpful if it's like really late and you can't go out and exercise. So I guess it really depends on your own body clock and your own routine. The next step is get focused. Now, if anything like me, you probably know that focusing is a good thing. You'll help us learn much quicker, but it's always so hard to do. And this is exactly why I found this little trick quite useful. Huberman says pick a point in the room to stare at for around 30 to 60 seconds. He says you can blink, but try not to have any other thoughts and just try and focus on that one point until the time's up. Now, this has to be one of my favorite tips because it seems so simple this one, but it actually works really well. And this is especially right after I stare at a point and then go straight to work. It's almost as if you can carry the focus between one thing and the other. And once I'm in the zone, Huberman recommends limiting each study session to a max of 90 minutes. And this is essentially because 90 minutes is about the maximum time that we can maintain intense focus for. And for me, the goal when I sit down is to do at least 60 minutes because often lose focus. But now I know if that happens, I use it as an excuse to take one of those 10 second breaks that we mentioned before to kind of reset. Now, even after you finish studying, Huberman mentions there are things you can do to make sure you actually remember what you just learnt. And he saw me falling asleep in the intro. That wasn't just for dramatic effect. Well, it kind of was, but it was also to show you the power of NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. And this involves things like meditation or napping for around 20 minutes. But personally, I find that I don't have that much time to rest after each study session. But luckily, Huberman says that even sitting there and doing nothing for one minute, but ideally 5 to 10, can have a similar effect as well. Now, I'll be honest, it's very hard to measure how effective this is in helping me study because there's just not many quantitative ways to go about measuring it. But one thing I've been doing this with is with physical skills. So learning kicks for more time or driving a particular route. I find that after practicing these physical movements and then doing nothing, I find that this actually helps me remember them much better. So obviously, the actual sleep that you get that night contributes to this as well. But basically, for physical skills, I found this very helpful. And for mental skills like doing mouth-floor, studying. I'm going to keep testing this out and see how it works in the long run. And out of all of these steps, Huberman says that getting alert, getting focused and sleep that night are the most essential steps. But as for how you go about each one, it obviously depends on your own style and routine. And personally, for me, focusing on that one point to help me get focused and taking those 10 second breaks during my study sessions. Those are two of the things that I've done the most helpful and something that I've implemented every day now. And if you're interested in the other study secrets I'm using at the moment, you may like this next one.",The STANFORD secret to learning 10x FASTER,03.11.2023,Julian Lin,Man,20s,5:11,7,"0,9992"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PvbVT4_EvU,Wentao,"Hey, it's Zara. In this video, I'll be talking about neural networks. Before we dive into neural networks, let's talk about machine learning in general. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, or AI, that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. I'm sure you're hearing AI way too often these days, and you're right to think it's becoming more of a marketing term. Some even argue that John McCarthy, who coined the term in the 1950s, intended it to be a marketing term to attract funding. Anyways, unlike traditional programing, where we explicitly define the rules and logic, machine learning enables computers to learn patterns and make predictions without being explicitly programed for specific tasks. Let's illustrate this with a real world example. Spam email detection. Let's say I receive an email and I want to determine whether it's spam or not spam. With traditional programing, I would need to write specific rules. For example, if an email contains words like “lottery”, “free” or “winner”, it's classified as spam. The limitation here is that I would need to anticipate and encode every possible rule. If spammers change their wording, the program may fail to identify new spam emails. On the other hand, with machine learning, instead of writing specific rules, we feed the machine learning algorithm a large data set of emails, each labeled - in the case of supervised learning - by humans as spam or not spam. The algorithm learns patterns from this data that differentiate spam from non-spam, and during training, the algorithm will try to build a model that minimizes the classification error, or more generally, something we call a loss function. In this way, the algorithm can adapt to new forms of spam without explicit reprograming. To illustrate this, if I were to plot the data with each email representing a point on a representative components, for example, x1 could be a measure of suspicious words, and x2 could be a measure of how generic the email is. These features or components could be engineered or learned. My hope is that the emails in my data plot are something like this. Now, this is obviously an oversimplified illustration, but I think you get the general idea. The stars would represent the spam and the circles would be the non-spam. I could simply draw a hyperplane, or in this case just a line to separate or classify these emails. Remember when I said we want to build a model? Well, this hyperplane is the current simple model that defines which email is spam or not. So if I receive a new email, it could be simply plotted here to see if it is spam or not, depending on where it's located. With respect to the separating hyperplane. Since the data, or the emails in this case, used to train the model were labeled, classifying the emails goes under supervised learning, which is one of the three types of machine learning. The other two being unsupervised learning. So for example, clustering news articles into categories. And the third is reinforcement learning, such as training a car's autopilot through an algorithm that rewards for desirable actions and penalizes for undesirable actions. If you want me to discuss more of these concepts in future videos, please let me know in the comments. What is a neural network? A neural network is a computational model developed around the mid 20th century, inspired by the way biological neurons in the human brain function. At its core, a neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process data and generate outputs based on that data. The network learns from input data by adjusting the connections, known as weights and biases, between these neurons to improve predictions or classifications over training iterations or time. The complexity and depth of these networks can vary depending on the problem they are designed to solve. The key components of the neural network are the nodes, the layers, and the connections. Neurons or nodes are the basic unit of a neural network. Neurons receive inputs, apply a mathematical operation, and pass the result on to the next layer. Each neuron is connected to other neurons, forming a network. We also have layers which are broken down into three categories. The input layer, which is the first layer that receives the raw data input, such as numerical values, images, or text. Next we have the hidden layers, which are the intermediate layers where the data is transformed by the network. The number and size of these layers can vary depending on the network's design. And finally we have the output layer, which is the final layer that produces the output of the network, such as a classification label or a predicted value. And finally, the third component of the neural networks are the connections or the weights and biases. Each connection between neurons has an associate weight, which determines the strength of the signal being passed. Biases are added to each neuron to shift the activation functions. Output. And this allows for more flexibility in the learning process. Mathematically, the operation within a neuron can be represented as follows. Where wi represents the weights, xi is the input, and b is the bias, and f is the activation function that determines the neurons output. Let's talk about f. First let's look at the sum inside. None of the operations in X are non-linear. We only see linear operations. It's just like ax + b where the xi's are simply multiplied by the weights wi’s and added. That's why we use activation functions. Activation functions like the sigmoid function and the ReLU or the rectified linear unit, are commonly used to introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns in the data. The sigmoid function is often used when the output needs to be interpreted as a probability, as its range is between 0 and 1. ReLU, on the other hand, introduces non-linearity while being computationally efficient, since it involves only a simple thresholding at zero. So if z is below zero, the neuron simply does not get activated. So maybe you can already see how these networks can represent complex functions by tuning which neurons get activated and which do not given a certain input. we've covered the basics of what neural networks are and how they're structured. I understand that these concepts might seem a bit abstract right now, but in the next lecture I'll introduce different types of neural networks and provide concrete examples to help make these ideas more clear and more practical.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_3mbfchlQE,Wentao,okay let's go into a little bit more detail about this fundamental theorem of calculus the thing that links differentiation and integration right there in two very very simple [Music] equations let's start with that definition the fundamental theorem of calculus so essentially says you have some function y that looks like this y is equal to F ofx and Y is continuous and differentiable so you can draw it without taking your pen off the page and there's no sharp corners or edges then you have this area under a curve a and fundamental theorem of calculus says that the derivative of a with respect to X is equal to Y but we also know that a is equal to the Limit as Delta X tends to zero of the sum from I = 1 up to n of Delta x * y of x i so this is the big idea you got something that links derivatives to the area underneath a curve now one thing that you need to know is that as Delta X tends to zero this [Music] sum in here this guy has a special symbol of its own it's called an integral and it looks like this a is equal to the integral of Y DX X that little DX thing there that's like a whole complete symbol it's really just illustrating that you have let a Delta X the size of your strip 10 to zero that's why that's still there it tells you what you're integrating with respect to so if we put those two things together now this one and this one these are the partnership really that's differentiation and integration working together we have da by DX is equal to y Y and the integral of Y DX is equal to a you can also write this using Newton's notation so it's essentially the same thing you can say the derivative of a function if that function is equal to something else then the integral of that something else will be equal to that function so these are saying identically the same thing some textbooks prefer this version some textbooks prefer this version but they are one and the same things they're saying exactly the same thing in fact we're going to use both of them actually as we go through and what these are both saying is that integration is the reverse process to differentiation okay so let's work through an example to see what we're actually talking about here let's imagine that you have got the example of the curve of Y = x^2 and you want to know the area between X is equal to 0 and x is equal to 1 Y is equal to x^2 and we want to know what is the area [Music] between xal 0 and X is equal to 1 so essentially we've got two options here we've got two different ways that we can calculate this we know that's the area there we know that the area you can work it out by doing this summation you can also work it out by doing the integral so let me show you both ways and show you how they end up being equivalent so you have two options here the first option is that you you could say well this area is equal to the Limit as Delta X tends to zero and actually work it out by hand of I = 1 up to n of Delta X Y of x i or option two is you could say well a this thing here is equal to the integral of Y X but we only care about this between n and one so here in this one this would be between X1 is equal to not and xn is equal to 1 and in here there's a simpler way to draw in these limits you can just say that we only care about this between not and one and put them in like that so let's try option one first but essentially what we're going to do now is we're going to take these two options and we're going to do them both and show that they end up giving you the same thing so using option one then a is the limit as Delta x ts to zero of this thing here of I = 1 up to n of Delta X now y of x i is just the function is just squaring it so we'll put that in so it's going to be x i^ 2 and this is between x i is equal to Zer and xn is equal to 1 Delta X is the width of each chop and there are going to be N Chops in total between x is0 and x is 1 so you could actually rewrite this as Delta X is equal to 1 / n and as Delta X tends to zero n is going to tend to Infinity so we can rewrite this thaning in those terms and as we do so let's just expand out this summation a little bit and have a look at what's going on here so we have got Delta X is just 1 / n and then we've got x i squar so X is just going to be equal to not X1 is going to be Delta X it's one step along Delta X which is just one over n or squared The Next Step along two hops along will be 2 over n or 2 * Delta X that's going to be squared plus the next one along will be 3 / n^ squar You're essentially just evaluating Y at each one of these steps exactly as we have before all the way up to n/ n or squared now when you have this long string actually every single one of these terms is going to have an n squ in the bottom which you can take out so this is equal to the Limit as n TS to Infinity of 1 / n cubed of 1 + 2 + 3 plus all the way up to n and each one of these terms is still going to be squared along the way in fact there is actually a formula for this thing here here you may have seen it before of course when you've been looking at uh geometric series sums of geometric and arithmetic series but this is actually equal to n + 1 * 2 n + 1 all divided 6 so this entire thing here the limit as n tends to Infinity of n + 1 2 n + 1 oh sorry it's n n + 1 n n + 1 2 n + 1 / 6 so this entire thing is equal to n n + 1 2 n + 1 all divided n cubed * 6 now as always with limits you can evaluate these so there's going to be an n in the top and an n in the bottom are going to cancel the limit of the entire thing Al together of two things multiplied by each other is the same as the limit of each of those things separately then multiply together afterwards so this is the same as 1/ 6 time the limit as n TS to Infinity of n + 1 / n if we just split up these fractions times the limit as n goes to Infinity of 2 n + 1 over n which if you have a little look at these we've got an n on the bottom and n on the top they're both the same same size so as n gets bigger and bigger and bigger these two are going to cancel each other out and this whole thing is just going to go to one likewise here You' got an n on the top and an n on the bottom and as n gets bigger and bigger and bigger these two things are going to grow at the same size so those two will cancel each other out and all you're left with is this factor of two on the top so this entire thing is going to end up having a limit of two so that means that a back at the beginning we kind of finished it now a is equal to 2 over 6 everything else in that limit just tends to 1 which is equal to 1 over 3 so that was option one that's kind of the annoyingly long way now let me show you the neat Quick Way by using integrals instead of summations so let's now try option two so for option option two we know that a is equal to the integral between not and one of Y DX we also know don't forget that d a by DX is equal to Y and we know that Y is equal to x^2 so putting these two things together essentially we know that da by DX is equal to X2 and this one here a is equal to to the integral between n and one of X2 DX so what we're saying here is that we're looking for a function a we're looking for something called a that when you differentiate it you get x s so what needs to be differentiated to give you X2 well let's try a few things let's try d by DX of x cubed well if we were differentiating that we would have 3x^2 which is nearly x s but not quite this pesky 3 is kind of getting in the way so we can try and include that in here try and cancel that out before we get to it how about we try something like X cubed over 3 we try and cancel out the three before it even arrives well if you differentiate that you do indeed get 3x^2 over 3 which is equ Al to x^2 which is what we want this is what we want so we know what you have to differentiate to give you X2 it's this thing in here and that is your answer that's what a is Da a by DX is equal to x^2 or Y so we've done it we've kind of done it it doesn't feel like you're doing it because you're just trying out a few different things until you till you spot something that fits but you are ually answering this question the thing that you need to differentiate to get X squ this thing here is X cubed over 3 that's our a so to get from the integral of X2 back to a it's just X cubed over 3 we have to evaluate this from X is equal to 0 and x is equal to 1 now we've kind of played this sort of trick before when we were going around with anti-derivatives the opposite process to differentiation we were saying what do you need to differentiate to end up with this and now we're saying the reverse of that process is if I integrate this what do I end up with it's all kind of one and the same thing so the only thing that remains now is to evaluate X at these particular limits and it just so turns out that to do that you put in the top number first inside this bracket and then take away this bracket with the second number so it's like this this is equal to X Cub over 3 at X is equal to 1 minus X Cub over 3 at x = 0 which is equal to 1 over 3 - 0 which means that a a is also equal to 1 over3 so notice there that's the value of a we got when we integrated and this right here is the value of a that we got when we went through all that fath of sorting out all of the summation so there are two things that I want you to notice about this example the first thing thing I is that they both have the same answer and thank goodness because that's kind of how we defined what an integral was in the first place but it's kind of nice and comforting to realize that that really is the case and there's nothing special about X squ here we could have picked any function at all really I just picked something nice and simple to demonstrate the ideas you could have picked anything at all and as long as you could work out this summation and as long as the integral worked they would end up giving you exactly the same answer because that is what integration actually means the second thing I want you to notice is just a little trick that we did in here of where you're evaluating an integral between two limits just to slightly formalize that for you what I was saying was that if you are taking the integral of something between A and B that is equal to F of B minus F of a where DF by DX is equal to FX just to make that super clear that's how you do it that's how you evaluate an integral at limits okay in summary I mean this is the key idea it's called the fundamental idea for a reason the fundamental idea the thing that links differentiation and integration right there in two very very simple equations there is no reason

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITwW825L4zg,Wentao,"SQL is a key data skill but where do you learn it how do you learn it and what are the important topics I know it's extremely intimidating even thinking about what is the first step especially because I came from a non-technical background when I was first learning SQL but sight now that I've been using SQL for many years as a data professional I know the more efficient and easier way to learn SQL and I will walk you through the exact steps that I would take if I'm learning SQL today first off let me get started with what is SQL SQL stands for structured query language and it allows you to interact with data for example with this statement of Select * from table where number is greater than five this is just saying give me all the data from the table where the numbers are greater than five so it's very much like simple English and it's something that I really believe you can pick up without a computer science background now why should you learn SQL can't AI do it yes AI can code but SQL is still very much a required skill set on many job listings including data analyst data scientist data engineer project manager so if you're interested in any of these job titles SQL is a skill that you should start learning in fact according to stack overflow survey from last year SQL Remains the third most used programming language across professional developers and employers value not just your ability to use SQL but your ability to use it to be able to draw insights to make business decisions as Reddit user mamertine best puts it I'm not paid because I can write SQL I'm paid because I can understand data employers are looking for you to not just use SQL but your ability to critically think about data and learning SQL will help you start doing this now that we know SQL is fundamental how would I learn it these are the three steps that I would take step one choose an environment SQL is used within a specific environment called database management system dbms and each dbms has its own flavor of SQL according to stack Overflow survey where over 90,000 professional developers responded they said that the three most commonly used dbms's are postgresSQL mySQL SQLlight and I'll make sure I include the links to these descriptions below so that you can start downloading them now what's the difference between these three and which one should you choose on the list well it really doesn't matter I would say the syntax is very similar across all three and they are all open source and free to download so I wouldn't be too concerned about which one to choose because you really can't go wrong but in my experience I've used postgresSQL and Microsoft SQL server and I really did not have any trouble transitioning between them so I would just say pick one and then move on to step two I'll also mention that if you don't prefer to download any software onto your laptop there are always cloud databases as an option which are on AWS Google cloud and Microsoft Azure they have limited free options as well so check that out step two learn the basics quickly in this step I am not going to try to memorize all the syntax or learn all of it as much as possible because there is a lot of SQL syntaxes and nobody memorizes them what I do want to focus on is learning the fundamentals and by fundamentals I mean what is a database what is a relational database what is SQL and what is its uses then I want to focus on the SQL syntax and structure this includes some of the statements like earlier select from where as well as the crud operations which stands for create read update and delete and how am I going to learn this well SQL is best learned by doing and research shows that when you passively learn you only retain about 20% of it whereas Active Learning allows you to retain about 75% to 90% of the information Interactive Learning is really important when learning SQL and that's why I chose the wrong way to learn SQL is by memorizing all the syntax this this will only teach you how to query the data but not actually understand it how I would start learning SQL in context is to start with a familiar small dataset like my credit card statement with about 20 to 30 rows of data I'll then analyze it and try to answer questions like what is my spending habit and that will teach me how to load data how to create a data table and then be able to order my data set and start doing a lot of what a data analyst would do and start writing my own queries and as I do this these are the topics I would progress from beginner to advanced SQL so how much SQL should you know the answer really depends on what your role is if you're a project manager a beginner level SQL is enough to be self-sufficient and be able to do your own queries and gather your own data but if you're looking for a more data heavy like a data analyst or a data scientist but more junior I would say a beginner to intermediate level is enough and that is about the level that a technical interview will be for SQL and then for advanced SQL I would say that's really for more senior level data roles as well as data Engineers who are more heavy on the data infrastructure side my tip for learning SQL goal is to continue practicing it in context because this will solidify your knowledge as well as give you the  confidence in your abilities there's a concept called curve of forgetting which relates to the idea of how we retain information on day one we remember about 100% of what we learned but on day 30 we only remember about 2% to 3% however when we expose ourselves to the same information daily whether it be 10 minutes minutes even 2 to 4 minutes as time progresses we tend to get  closer to the 100% mark of what we retain and this concept very much applies to learning SQL it's not a skill that you can learn in a day but it is a skill that as you practice you will get good at it and you will retain it so have the confidence and continue to practice your SQL skills if you found this video helpful please like and subscribe to the channel and watch my next video where I

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSkREem8dM,Wentao,what's going on everybody welcome back to another video today we're gonna be taking a look at the differences between a database a data warehouse and a data lake only ever heard of a database and i think that's what most people are familiar with but i had never heard of a data warehouse or a data lake and so in this video we're gonna be walking through the differences between each one of them as well as how they kind of connect with one another so let's jump onto my screen and get started all right so we're gonna be taking a look at a database a data warehouse and a data lake but let's start with a database now when someone says a database typically they're referring to a relational database now a relational database can capture and store data via an oltp process which stands for online transactional process so when company completes a transaction and sells an item it'll record that within a database and that data has the ability to be live real-time data data in a database is going to be stored in tables which has columns and rows and this will be highly detailed which means you're going to be able to go in and see every single aspect of the data and databases also have a really flexible schema which means you can go in there and kind of change things as you go to make it work for what you need now a data warehouse is also a database just like we were looking at before but it's going to be used for analytical processing or olap olap stands for online analytical processing and it's created to basically analyze huge amounts of data now if you notice on the last slide there were these three databases they were just kind of sitting there and they were storing the data in this visualization that we have on the right these three databases on the bottom are all aggregating and sending their data to this data warehouse via an etl process which is where it extracts the data it transforms it and loads it exactly how they need it in this data warehouse and that's how data is put into the data warehouse it isn't getting it directly from the source but it's being put into a database and via the etl process is being updated as it goes or whenever the etl process runs a data warehouse will always have the historical data but it won't always have the current data unless the etl process is running every single day or very frequently the data in the data warehouse is also a little bit different because we're doing this etl process to get the data in there we're not actually putting every single piece of data or every column and row in there we're typically summarizing it and then putting it in there which will allow us to process that data for our analytical purposes much faster now a data warehouse is going to have a much more rigid schema so you really need to plan ahead with how you're going to put your data into a data warehouse it's not as flexible as just a database so now let's look at some of the key differences between a database and a data warehouse a database is going to be used for recording transactions or a data warehouse is going to be used for analytics and reporting a database is going to have fresh and detailed data where a data warehouse is going to have summarized data it's only going to be as fresh as the etl process is created a database is going to be a little bit slower for querying large amounts of data and when you do query large amounts of data it can actually slow down the processing of all those transactions a data warehouse was designed for the exact opposite it was designed to be very fast at querying and not slow down any processes because it isn't part of that transaction processing at all so now that we've looked at a database and a data warehouse let's take a look at a data lake a data lake was basically designed to capture any type of data that you could possibly want it could be a video a picture an image a document a graph anything you could imagine that you'd want to put in a database or store in some way you can store it in a data lake now there are a ton of use cases for a data lake but i think people who work with machine learning and ai get to use it or benefit from it the most they can use all that structured and unstructured data and create models to really use it in its raw form where if you want to use it for analytical purposes typically you're gonna have to clean it up a little bit and do a little bit more work to actually make it usable and so a dale lake is just that it's this lake where you can basically throw any type of data in there but it's not always super usable because you're just putting it in there in its raw form if you want to use it for analytical purposes and reporting most of the time you're going to want to clean that up and put it into a database or a data warehouse so now when we're looking at all three they are all different and they're all used for different purposes so no one option is better than another for your data if you're using it just to record transactions a database is what you should do and if you have a large amount of data that's just too much for your database to handle it sounds like you might need a data warehouse and if you have all this data they have no idea what to do with or it's unstructured semi-structured data that you can't fit into a database well then i highly recommend using a data lake there really is no one size fits all all three of these can be options for different uses and in fact you can use all three within one company for just different things that your company needs so i hope that that was helpful learning the differences between a database a day warehouse and a data lake again i had really never used a data warehouse or a data lake when i first got into analytics but now that i've gotten hands-on experience with all of them they're all really interesting can be used for so many different things so thank you so much for watching this video i really appreciate it if you like this video be sure to like and subscribe below and i'll see you next video [Music] ,Database vs Data

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-k7b8Zmh70,Wentao,"wrote something surprising. Zarathustra—a sage who is also the central character of the book—tells his followers to stop following him. He says, “I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it. I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathustra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.” This is one of my favourite parts of the book. I found it surprising, but interesting, that the sage would tell his followers to be ashamed of him, abandon him, and mistrust him. Why would he do that? As usual, I’m gonna explore this idea through a dialogue. ---A young student (S) spent years searching for enlightenment. He travelled across many countries and lived among various groups of ascetics, but after searching for years, he found his quest to be fruitless. Finally, he gave up and decided to work on a farm. The farmer (F) he worked with was a simple man. He didn’t talk much, but when he did, he enjoyed a good philosophical debate with the student. At first, the student was open to debate, doubting much of what the farmer said, thinking he was similar to the other ascetics the student had met in the past. But after some time, the young student sensed an immense wisdom and tranquility inside the farmer. He started to agree with the farmer more and more. The students desire for enlightenment had returned, and so the student worked with the farmer for months, absorbing his knowledge. Eventually, the farmer noticed that the student had stopped debating with him, and the following conversation ensued. F: I think it’s time for you to leave me. S: Leave? Why? F: Listen, when you first arrived here, we had many things to teach one another. We grew together and learned from each other. Your mind was inquisitive. But recently, you’ve begun to believe everything I say. You’ve gone from an inquirer to a believer, and I won’t let you do that to yourself or to me. We’re both better off if you leave. S: But I came seeking the truth, and I found it in you. F: The truth! You’re lost kid. S: Why would you send me away like this? How can you do that to me? F: Let me show you something. Take a look at this map. What do you see? S: I see our farm, the river nearby, and the mountains. F: No, you see /an image/ of our farm, the river nearby, and the mountains—not the things themselves. Now tell me, what can you learn from this map? S: I can learn where the farm and the river are, the height of the mountain, where the berry trees are, where we plant our carrots… F: No you can’t. Give it a few millennia. The river will dry up, the mountains will move, and this farm may be a city. You can’t learn anything about the farmas it is, you can only see an image of it as it was at some point in time. See, a man’s memory is like this map. It can capture a shadow of reality, and he can share that with you, but he can never give you the reality itself. A man can give you his memories of the truth, but he can never give you the truth itself. He can tell you where the farm was, but you’d still have to verify it for yourself. If you want the truth as you say, there can be no intermediaries, no middlemen. If there’s a middleman, then he is the one you are following, not the truth. S: But what’s wrong with following you? F: If you follow me, you’ll live according to /my/ memories. You’ll live according to /my/ map, and you’ll never learn to construct your own. What if my map is wrong? Then you’ll be lost with me, and you won’t be able to correct me because you never learned to navigate on your own. And if you can’t correct me, then we’re no longer able to help each other. But if you learn to see for yourself, if you learn to construct your own map of reality, then we can come together as friends and individuals. We can compare our maps and help one another see reality as it really is. And when we both see reality as it is, we can journey through it together, as equals. S: I guess you’re right. I’ll start packing my things. --- In a letter to his sister, Nietzsche wrote, “if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire.” And in my opinion, Zarathustra tells his followers to leave him because they are still believers. He wants them to become inquirers. He doesn’t want followers. He doesn’t want people to believe what he says. He wants them to doubt him, inquire, verify what he says for themselves, and see if they arrive at the same vision of reality. And if they arrive at the same vision of reality, then they can be travellers in this world together. They can be equals. But if they simply believe what he says, then they become followers. Followers learn to follow someone else’s map, and by doing so, they lose a direct connection to reality. And if they lose a direct connection to reality, we all lose the value that comes from their own unique perspective. We lose the value of independent verification and the possibility of someone correcting us. But inquirers, on the other hand, make their own maps and maintain their connection to reality. And because of this, they bring us actual value through their unique perspective of the world. But at the end of the day, this is just my opinion and understanding of Nietzsche’s words, not advice. Feel free to use this information however you like, and if you have a different take on Nietzsche’s words, I’d love to hear your perspective in","Nietzsche - Follow No One, Trust Yourself",20.08.2021,Freedom in Thought,Man,40s,06:36,7,"0,9926"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxN5vSy0d8k,Josy," People are making thousands of dollars in passive income every month selling products that don't even exist until someone places an order. $34,000 per month. The realistic earnings have been able to make with printout demand. About over $1,000,000. $63,000. $1,000 per month. Multiple six figures in profit. $1,000 per month. But is this actually a realistic side hustle impossible for anyone to do? Well, as an experienced millionaire businessman, I'm going to put this to the test myself by making and selling my own print-on-demand product. As this is a side hustle challenge, I'm setting myself for usual rules. Rule one, I must sell under a fake name. Rule two, I can't spend more than $0. And rule three, I must launch the business within 24 hours. Start the timer! The first thing on my plan is to find a supplier with easy to use software. For anyone who doesn't know how print-on-demand works, here's a very quick breakdown. You make a design and partner with a company and in return they print and ship your product when someone buys it. This means if we execute everything correctly, then all we have to do is click the paycheck. So I'm just going to make a free account with Gelato as they seem to have fulfillment centers all around the world. And from what I can see, have the most straightforward software for me to use. Right, so now we need to decide what kind of product we want to sell. There are lots of different products perfect for print-on-demand, such as T-shirts, mugs and bags, but instead of just guessing, I'm going to do some market research to find out what's actually selling well. I like to use TikTok for this kind of thing as lots of people are using it to promote their print-on-demand stores because they have an integrated shop feature. You've probably seen the little banner that pops up at the bottom of some TikToks, giving you the option to buy what's in the video. Honestly, my son's girlfriend has bought so much on TikTok shop. I'm not just looking for one-off videos, I want to find out account that consistently sells the same product. If someone is investing their time in creating multiple videos, it's safe to assume that the product is selling well. Right, I think I've found the perfect product. Wall art. First, based on what I've seen on TikTok, there's a large market of aspiring entrepreneurs who love putting motivational artwork on their walls to keep themselves motivated and working hard. Secondly, Wall art is very cheap to make, but it seems from my research that I can sell it for a high price as it's more than impulse purchase. This means that my profit margins will be very good as I'll make more money per sell. And thirdly, there are so many different ways I can scale this business. Just think if I grew it big enough, I could even branch out into premium artwork. Look, wealthy people can hang in their mansions. Imagine how much I could sell those for, but I'm getting a bit ahead of myself here. First, we need to make some designs. Right, I've got a confession to make and I'm not proud of it. As you know, I'm under a time limit here and I don't really have enough hours left to make my own designs and do everything else on my list. If I was a bit younger, then I could probably use an AI tool like mid-journey to create the wall art for me. But you guys know I'm a boomer, so it would take me a little while to get the hang of it. And time isn't something I have lots of right now. That doesn't mean I'm about to die by the way. So long story short, I've ordered five different wall art designs from three different sellers on Fiver. I sent them all this brief. I would like you to create an entrepreneurial poster that can be framed and used as wall art. Please come up with your own quote, idea and theme. I think something entrepreneurial or motivational would be best. I intend on using the poster size 30 by 40 centimeters. That's 12 inches by 16 inches for all our American viewers. I look forward to seeing the design. This is going to be pretty interesting as I really don't have time to make any changes and I'm kind of leaving my fate in their hands. While we're waiting for those designs to come back, let's use this opportunity to make an online store. I've decided I'm going to sell on Etsy as it's relatively simple and has a low barrier to entry. Platforms like this are great as they already have an established customer base for you to tap into. The downside is that it's often erased at the bottom as your product is nothing but a commodity and it's only compared on price. Although my designs are unique, there are still a lot of people selling similar products. If you want to build a business that stands the test of time, I suggest heading over to something I Shopify and creating your own store. So it's the next morning and I've been sent some designs to review. I haven't looked at them yet so let's look at them together. Actually, I quite like this one. The design looks pretty cool and the quote is very true. I'll tell you what, if I had a penny for every time someone said my success was due to luck and not hard work, then I'd be rich. Oh wait, I am. This next guy seems to have made five different designs. Let's take a look. Honestly, these designs do look pretty basic and the quotes are just stating the obvious. The only one I really like is the last one and even that looks like something I could have done in two minutes. Okay, so it's all riding on this last seller. This is actually my favourite design so far. This next one I'm not so keen on but I can see is at least try to play with the text a little bit. Maybe this will appeal to the girls is it's got that sort of swirly font. I think they like that sort of thing. Right, now we've got to upload these designs onto gelato. Since this is a print on demand product, I don't have to pay for anything until a sale is made. So this is great if you're starting out with zero dollars. So I'm just going to go to the menu on the left hand side and select product catalogue. As you can see, there are a lot of different options here but I'm of course going to select wall art. So this pulls up a selection of different types of posters. Now I'm going to pick wooden framed posters. I'm then going to go with the premium matte paper option as I can see that this is the best seller. And to be honest, I don't think people are really be able to tell the difference between this and the museum quality one but my profits certainly will. So I'm going to select 30 by 40 centimetres as I think this is the best size poster for most houses. And it seems to be the size most people select. Then I'm going to pick vertical and a black frame color as that's pretty sort of gender neutral and ready to hang because not assembled. Hey, nobody get time for this! I'm just going to repeat the steps with all my designs, including the ones I didn't like. After all, I've got nothing to lose and who knows, I might even sell some. Now I've got all the designs uploaded. I'm going to go over to the menu and select stores. This is where you can link your gelato account with your Etsy store. If you don't want to sell on Etsy, as you can see, there are lots of different options. Right, I could just upload the designs from Fiber right onto my Etsy listing but to be honest, they don't look very premium. So I'm going to use the built-in mock-up studio by clicking here. This tour will help me bring the posters to life. First, we just have to set the dimensions for our file size. Oh, they have actually on here an Etsy preset. So I'm going to just select that. But you can also set custom sizes if you'd like to create mock-ups for things like Instagram stories. Now we need to select a scene for our mock-up. Oh, now that one looks good, so let's go with that. You can zoom in and move around a scene by just double-clicking on it. So I'm going to adjust it to make the scene a little bit bigger, so there's more focus on my poster design. Next, let's select our poster size. I'm going to set it to 30 by 40, as I said before, most poster designs are this size. These are looking pretty good. Now, the last step before we can sell our wall art, setting a price. I've just taken a quick look at the price navigator tool, and in here, it lays out exactly what the product costs. How much shipping will set us back and even the total profit per sell. Looking at all of this, I think a good price would be $49.99. This is a bit high compared to most competitors on Etsy, which will definitely impact sales. But I'm willing to take a bit of a risk, because I always think a nice profit margin is around 50%. Right, so I'm over in Miami on business, but I've been keeping an eye on our side hustle challenge. And I'll tell you what, I've got some results. But before I share them with you, check this out. I actually ordered a couple of our products and got them shipped to me over here in the USA. And I think that's pretty good. And the quality as well is absolutely fantastic. I think I'm going to keep these. Actually, I'm really impressed with the shipping time, as well. It took three days to get these tools, which is far better than to try these drop shippers. And that should give us an advantage. I'd actually always recommend ordering your product before you start selling it, because reputation is everything. And you don't want customers speaking negatively about your product. So I've left it just a few more days, because things were going nicely. Now for the moment you've all been waiting for, did we make any sales? Well, yes and no. Some of the posters generated a few sales, and some didn't even catch your bite. Overall, we generated 11 sales, which led to £549.89. But of course, this isn't all profit. First, we had to pay for designs on Fiverr, which was £60.77. Then it's, he'd take a small cut of 6.5% on each cell, which came to £35.74. And let's not forget the product and shipping cost, which came to £371.69. By the way, as I used gelato a lot in this video, I reached out to them and asked them if they could give you guys some kind of discount on these fees. They agreed. So with the link in the description, you can get 50% off your first order. With all those expenses deducted, it leaves us with a grand total of £81.69. Considering that I accomplished all the setup within 24 hours and now have the designs, I'd consider this a success. This means I can continue selling these products over the next few weeks with minimal additional expenses. If you guys would be interested in seeing a part two where I allow myself more time to revamp the business and see how far I can take it, let me know in the comments. If you want to know how to sell blank books on Amazon, then I'm going to leave that video right up there. But don't click on it, just yet. Make sure to subscribe if you want to grow your wealth.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc91iOxcB3c,Andre," For people who have been around for a while, you might be seeing the title and thinking, Chaden, aren't you allergic to cats? And to that, I'd say, yes. Kind of. I'm actually not sure anymore. And for the people who know anything about me, you might see the title and think, Chaden, cats are literally the number one natural predator to birds. And to that, I also say, yes. That one's 100% broom-backed. So let me back up a bit and explain how we got here, because all the cards in the world were stacked against the idea of me getting a cat. Growing up, I was irrefutably and absolutely allergic to cats. My best friend had like three of the things, and every time I would hang out or sleep over at her house, I would be a sneezey, watery-eyed, snotty mess. Can I have some water? Given the fact my brother was also allergic to cats, it was set that we were a dog family. My whole life I went around not giving cats a second thought. I never had anything actually against them, but since I was forced to stay 20 feet away from them or suffer the consequences, I just couldn't get to know them. Plus, as a kid, dogs were always more appealing. They're more likely to be bigger fans of playing and running around, be more approachable with their genetically bred, unconditional love, and can overall be more forgiving. Cut to like two cat-less decades for me later, and I'm meeting Jacob for the first time at his place. As we're hanging out in his living room, his cat Frazier comes over and greets me. Frazier is extremely social and vain, so he's always expecting nothing less than a never-ending stream of attention from the people. Even though he's very cute and distinguished, I deployed my typical foolproof plan of don't touch the cat. Frazier realizes he's not getting any attention out of me and sits down nearby on the couch. But a bit later, Jacob's other cat ends up making an appearance. This one's Taylor, she's normally really shy and hides, but does really like women, which I am. Taylor ended up crawling onto me and making herself really comfy in my womanly lap. Jacob, knowing I'm allergic, offered to take her away, but this was actually the first time a cat has ever done something like this to me. I've always been a bit of a cat magnet if you want to call it that, because I act like they don't exist, which they interpret as me not pushing their boundaries and creating a comfortable environment for them to come up to me on their own terms. But never have I felt like a cat has chosen me like this before. I told Jacob I'm happy to let her stay comfortable on me, and I'll just reap the consequences of my sewing later on. This was my first extremely positive experience with the cat, and I honestly felt really happy and special and wanted to enjoy it. A few hours later, I'm saying my goodbyes, and during the drive back home, I realized I was completely fine. No sneezing, no itchy eyes, straight up nothing. I was so confused and curious. Thus, the start of my little cat experiment began. Every time I went over to Jacob's place, I would let the cats be as social as they wanted with me. If Taylor wanted to sit by me, I'd let her. If Frazier wanted attention, I would pet him. At one point, while we were watching a movie, Taylor literally decided to lay down on my neck, feeling everyone of my breaths with cat dander and hair. And you know what happened? No reaction! Not even a little drip of mucus. Somehow, sometime, I'd grown out of my cat allergy and never noticed. Apparently, every seven years, people's allergies have the chance to change. Maybe being surrounded by my friend's cats all throughout my childhood could have helped my body get more familiar with them. Either way, I've now unlocked the skill to survive cats. Oh guys, it was incredible. Now that I'd been freed from my shackles, I immediately started taking time to get to know cats more. Instantly, they felt so much more cute and cool and approachable and aww, it was so hard. I was really starting to like them more, especially since every time I would hang out at Jacob's place, Taylor would walk over and be around me and purr, and... Oh, it was amazing to be loved by a cat! So, I really like cats now. And after some time, I decided I wanted one too. Jacob and I decided to peruse a local cat rescue website just to see what cats were available. I don't want to get one right away, there's a lot of have going on, but it doesn't hurt. Oh my god, that one! I want that one so bad, it's so cute. What's this name? Toast out of Toast out of Toast out of my beloved! We have to send in an application, we have to! Hi, my name's Jayden, I love this cat. Please let me adopt it. Please, please, please. What? You guys know me, I'm week-willed and impulsive. My first mistake was liking cats to begin with. The rescue reached out a few days later for a cat screening interview to make sure we would be a good fit to be cat parents. After being approved, they told us we could pick any cat we wanted that was in their care. Of course, I asked about Toastada, but we were given the unfortunate news that she had already been adopted. Nooo! We looked at the other cats available on the website, but unfortunately none of them really stood out to me. The rescue ended up inviting us to a little meet the cats event, they were hosting where we could see all the cats they had up for adoption in person. Which was awesome because that was actually the first time I'd ever actually seen and held a kitten before. It was amazing, but as cute and tiny as they all were, there still wasn't one that called to me. I pride Jacob away from the kittens, headed home, and we started waiting. Every day I would check the rescue's cat list to see if any new ones caught my eye. I didn't even know what I was looking for, but waited for the universe to send me my perfect cat nonetheless. One morning I refreshed the page and saw one new kitten added. A tourty they found in some dumpster named Scrabble. With the biggest eyes and forehead I'd seen in my life. Something about this bizarre little creature called to me. I messaged the rescue about Scrabble and they told me she's available, putting me in touch with Scrabble's foster parents. Every day they sent me new little pictures of kitten Scrabble and every photo I felt more and more in love with her. She seemed so silly and playful and those eyes. We got on a video call and they told me all about how big of a personality she has. Out of the five other kittens they were fostering, she was by far their favorite. The whole time we were talking Scrabble was flipping around in their arms and looking at the camera with her giant orbs. I left that call knowing I found my cat. I needed to have little kitten Scrabble, meeting her in person only cemented it. She was shy at first but after flinging around her worm toy she immediately started hopping around and being the life of the party. I talked a lot to her foster parents and they just gushed about how they wish they could keep her since they all loved her so much. Even though the rescue called her Scrabble, obviously that was more of a placeholder name. The foster parents called her Kami but neither of those really fit to me. However, I knew one name that I liked. I stole another kitten's name and paced it on mine. So what? Big Dale! Toastada is a great name! My Toastada is way more of a Toastada than the other Toastada anyway. Look at her. I would have left with little Toastada in my arms that moment if I could. But unfortunately Jacob and I were going out of town for 3 million weeks and had to wait to take her home until after we came back. She was all I could think about the entire time. I was shoving Toastada photos in everyone's face every chance I got. The foster parents were sending Toastada updates every day. I was overflowing with yearning for this cat. She was growing and learning about the world without me. Take me home to my child. Literally the moment Jacob and I landed we drove straight from the airport to the foster home to pick her up. I could not wait. We arrived home with plus one Toastada. I couldn't believe it. I have a mammal now. I'm sorry other mammal owners, but it's the best mammal in the whole wide universe. Jacob and I spent the entire day playing with her letting her get used to her new surroundings. She was so cute and so tiny. Here's a video of her eating wet food with a big ol' chomp. As someone who's owned birds for 7 years at that point, it felt so strange to have a pet that was significantly less fragile. And also draw significantly less blood. You mean this thing can't fly up and get hit by the ceiling fan? Insane! I've had Toastada for a while now. She's two years old at the time of me posting this. And let me tell you, this thing has become a creature. First of all, eyes still giant. And she never blinks. Look at this. She was sitting on my desk looking like that long enough for me to notice. Get my phone out of my pocket. Pull up the camera app. Put the camera in her face and take a photo. And here's like four more. Also, not that smart. I'm sure you can deduce that by how she looks. But this thing has a single brain cell and it's just another version of herself up there with a joystick. Jacob and I are fully convinced she can only form a few thoughts today and only in single word nouns. Evidently, Toastada is also very scared of everything. Always has been. Loud noises, quiet noises, no noises, movement of any kind. Even Jacob, a person she's been around all her little life post dumpster. There's been times where he'll be at his desk, moves his chair just a smidge, and she's darting out of the room. One time we were trying to explain to some friend's house skittish she genuinely can be, and demonstrated it by grabbing a toy literally in front of her, raising it up a bit, lightly dropping it on the floor, still in front of her, and she bolted. You know how cats are genetically built to be good at balancing? Well Toastada can't even do that. She trips and falls and misplaces her feet all the time. On multiple occasions she has tried to walk across my L-shaped desk and just mist and fell down. That's like the one thing that makes a cat a cat, and nope, doesn't hit the mark there either. She's gotten better, but as a kitten Toastada couldn't even jump. After I built her her first cat tower, I watched as she attempted to jump up to the second level, not quite make it, and had to slam her arms down on the thing to hoist herself up like she was mountain climbing. But always she the sweetest little thing. When I got a cat, I was expecting it to want its own space, come around when it wants, you know, general cat things. But this creature follows me from room to room with those high beams of her. She sits on my lap while I'm at my computer, lays on my giant Pokemon blushes, mostly just looks up at me from the floor and just stares. When I'm sleeping she'll just crawl into bed and tuck herself up right next to me. Look at all these photos of her straight up on me when I'm sleeping. Don't look too close so I don't have makeup on. Bedtime is sacred to her. She loves bedtime. If I'm working late, Toastada will come into my office around 9 or 10pm. AKA past Toastada bedtime and just start crying, scratching on my chair, rolling around on the floor. It's pitiful. And if I still don't move after that, she'll go into the bedroom and drag over her string toy she always plays with. It's just so sad and pathetic. I always play string with her when she brings it over though. Don't worry. But lately she's picked up another routine habit, which is pets. Not all cats like the pets, but Toastada lives off them. It's when you just slap a cat's butt and it looks like you're hurting them, but they actually love it. However, Toastada's really particular about pets. First of all, I'm the only one allowed to give her pets. Jacob is tried and she runs away scared and offended every single time. Second, she has to receive pets on a specific spot on the floor of the closet. If I try to give her pets in like my office, she bolts to her floor spot, staring at me to continue them over there. Also, she begs to be pet every single night. Like clockwork, she'll sit like a gargoyle in front of the closet and cry pitifully until I come over there. Now when I finally come over for pets, she'll flop on the floor and start horizontally rock climbing her way across the floor with her claws and tangle herself up in the ethernet cables while I keep up the pets. You think I'm joking, but I'm very much not. This is the only way she accepts pets. And I have to give them to her every night or else she's miserable. Toastada's world is so small. She's really just around me, Jacob Taylor and Frazier, but she loves her simple family so much. When kitten Toastada first met Frazier, she was terrified of him. She'd been around other adult cats before, but she'd never seen a flat cat in her life and she was mortified. Of course, she's since warmed up to him and they play together and hang out all the time, their best friends. But Toastada loves Taylor. Always has. She looks up to Taylor like a little baby sister admiring her cool, awesome older sibling. Unfortunately, Taylor hates it. They literally have a SpongeBob Squidward type of sibling relationship. And Toastada is so oblivious to it. Taylor has annoyingly swatted at Toastada so many times just for existing around her that Toastada now thinks it's a fun little game they play and will start chasing and swatting back at Taylor happily, not understanding cat social cues. Of course, never in a way that's too far, but just enough to get on Taylor's nerves even more. Between the three of them, they all have such different little personalities and relationships to each other. It's made our lives so much more entertaining. And to anyone concerned about the birds, don't worry. I've got Ari and Toast who are very separated from the cats. They're safe in their own blocked-off room connected by a double door system that ensures no possible interaction between bird and cat. If anyone is thinking about getting cats and birds as pets, it is possible, but just make sure that two are very separate. Especially if you have smaller birds like conures or budgies. I'm sure there's people out there that have trained their cats to be fine around a pet bird. But to me, all it takes is one accident or attack for you to just not have a bird anymore. Plus, having the two of them takes a huge amount of time and commitment. I've said it before and I'll say it forever. I love my birds to death, but they do not make good pets for the very large majority of people. In terms of allergies, I do think I was originally still a little bit allergic to Toastata, ironically. When I first got her, I was sneezing and sniffling. Nothing allergy pills couldn't fix. And it never was as bad as my original cat allergy. But I think I've been growing out of that one too, because nowadays I don't have any reaction to her at all. These are a mystery. I am building my immunity to everything. Next up is Rat poison. I didn't think I would make a video talking about this thing, but Toastata has just got such a funny little personality and has become such a big part of my life. She may be the description of autism, but I love her more than the world itself, and I know I'm the center of her little life too. I don't even see her as a cat. She's just a little creature that follows me around looking weird, but I love it. And I'm so glad I grew out of my cat allergy just so I can have her. It really has been so different owning a cat, mainly because I know Toastata won't just bite me at any given chance, unlike some avian creatures. Thanks for watching the video. Heads up. I'm going to be announcing new merch again soon. So be on the lookout for that. The last drop went so well, and I'm really glad that so many of you guys enjoyed it. I'm so excited to finally be getting back into making fun merch. And it really helps me out a lot. Alright, sorry. Thanks. Anyway, I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye.",I got a cat.,26.10.2024,JaidenAnimations,woman,,16:03,5,"0,9999"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6eLTcIWEU,Andre," Here's a little social interaction life hack I've discovered. If you're meeting someone new and you want to get to know them better and you see any semblance of a tattoo peaking out of their sleeve, compliment it. If that person doesn't want to talk about their tattoos, they'll say, oh, thank you! Anyway, this is my stop, but if they do want to talk about their tattoos, their face will light up and then they'll do the rest of the talking. I realize that by giving you this advice, now anytime I compliment someone else's tattoos, it will seem disingenuous, but it's not. Most of the time. I love all of your tattoos. That's right, I'm talking to you. I love your tattoos, dude. Whether it's how you got the tattoo, the meaning behind the tattoo, or being a tattoo of something you like, every tattoo is a story, and most people love telling stories about themselves. I wouldn't know anything about that, personally. I never understood why some people liked talking about their tattoos until I got one of my own. What, you think I'm going to make a whole video about tattoos when I didn't even have any? That's right, I'm a marked man, mom. What are you going to do about it? Stop unconditionally loving me? Yeah, right. Wait, what are you doing with that cheese grater? Okay, but in all seriousness, can you make sure grandma doesn't see this video, mom? I don't want to upset her on the way out. Back in the day, tattoos used to be a symbol of rebellion and meant she couldn't get a job. No regards, baby. But I feel like tattoos are getting more and more accepted, if not expected. I'll see a jacked bald guy covered in tattoos and think, okay, yeah, he was meant to look like that. For me, the idea of being a badass tattooed guy with a sketch pad and a beanie and ripped jeans and a beaded bracelet always seemed cool to me. But like most people, when it came to tattoos, I had reservations. Ooh, this is going to be on my body forever. What if I hate it? I had an idea once of getting these five magic the gathering symbols tattooed on my forearm. I even dotted them out in sharpie ones just to give them a test drive. But I ultimately decided not to get them because I was worried in five years I would go, oh, these? I was really into magic the gathering in my 20s. Not anymore, though. So now every morning I wake up with impending feelings of shame and remorse that I even decided to get this thing. And I didn't want that to happen, even though I've been playing magic for over 15 years and it means a lot to me and I'm going to be buried with my sliver deck. And, all right, maybe I should just get it. Even though people know that tattoos are permanent, there are still way more bad tattoos than there should be. One time I saw this picture of someone's tattoo on a bad tattoo subreddit and I thought it'd be funny to prank my family group chat by photoshopping that tattoo onto my arm. And then I thought it'd be funny to post that picture onto Instagram. I didn't think anyone would fall for this poor excuse of a Photoshop job, but then the internet and my family proved me wrong. Immediately, I started getting phone calls for my parents and even my book agent rang me up and was like, did you actually get that tattoo? No, it's not a real tattoo. I mean, it is a real tattoo, but it's on someone else's body. That's their cross to bear. I can only imagine what that person's family and book agent went through. My parents were not supportive of me getting tattoos. But who's are, am I right? Some people, like my parents, say that your body is like a temple. And getting tattoos is like putting graffiti on it. Which, sure, okay, that's why I paid a professional graffiti artist to paint my temple exactly how I wanted. Also, you can't tell me not to deform my body when that's exactly what you did before I was even 24 hours old. Also, Jesus had piercings and he loves showing them off to his buddies. So I think you'd be chill with a little tattoo. After much thought and deliberation, I finally settled on what my first tattoo would be. This was going to be permanently inked onto my body for the rest of my life. I got a tattoo tattoo in Coriour, New. Luckily, the artist was able to finish this in one session. It took quite a while, almost five whole minutes. Now, let me explain why I got it. It was so that if anyone ever asked me, do you have any tattoos? I could go, why? Yes, I do. And then roll up my sleeve and then I'd go, ha, ha, ha. When I showed off my tattoo tattoo on Jaden's streamathon, there was one comment that said, James having tattoo actually tattooed onto him is exactly the kind of tattoo I expected James to have. And that made me feel really good because that meant the tattoo fit my vibe. And the second reason I got the tattoo was because I wanted to rebel. Since tattoos were frowned upon growing up, I wanted to have one just to have one. So I got a tattoo with no meaning whatsoever, which in a way is the meaning. Even though the tattoo tattoo was small and usually covered up by my sleeve, I still felt anxious about getting it. And I continued to feel that way for about a week after I got it. It was a jump scare every time I saw it in the mirror, and I would look at it closely and go, yep, that's really in there. I sure hope I don't regret this. But then after some time, the tattoo tattoo just became a part of me. Like, I didn't look in the mirror and go, yep, there's James and tattoo, I would go, yep, there's James. Full stop. And from that day on, I loved giving people advice on tattoos. As a marked man myself, I think you should absolutely get that shadow the hedgehog full back piece. Yolo, remember? What? You're worried that it's going to look bad when you're 70? Yeah, it's going to look bad when you're 70. You're 70. Don't think about how bad it's going to look. Think about how much you're going to enjoy it from now to when you're 69. I've known people my age who still hide their tattoos from their parents, but like the honest prodigal son that I am, I wasn't going to be doing that. But the next time I visited my parents, I walked into their house, and the very first thing my mom said to me was, do you have any tattoos? She beat me to the punch. What? Why would you ask that? Because last night, I had a dream that you came home and were covered in tattoos. So which one of you accepted my mom? God? I said, are all tattoos bad? Yes, all of them are bad. Even this one, and I rolled up my sleeve and revealed my massive tattoo. And her reaction was, well, it's not the worst word to have permanently inked on your body. Later on, she said, if you go to a Star Wars party, you could change it to Tattooine. So I think she took it pretty goodly. Now, some of you might be thinking that my epic sleeve of a tattoo isn't that big a deal. It's tiny and can only be seen if I'm swimming or boxing or wearing a tank top. But you see, after getting tattooed, tattooed, I experienced what people in the Tattooing business call, catching the bug. After seeing how much I liked my first tattoo and knowing that I could handle having a tattoo, I was ready to get something bad as... I set up a big boy tattoo appointment with an artist I liked. And when I was in the tattoo shop, the artist asked, is this your first tattoo? Is this my first tattoo? No, sweetheart. I think I know a thing or two about tattoos. So without further ado, I would like to debut this out of the blue Tattooine. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! You know from the dark crystal that Jim Henson 80s puppet movie that I did a video on a year ago. Now I have the best character permanently inked onto my skin forever and ever. That movie will always hold the special place in my heart and now it'll hold a special place under my skin. And now whenever I show someone the Chamberlain, we end up talking about the dark crystal, which is great because that's what I wanted to talk about anyways. I think I just discovered an autistic conversational cheek code. When I was getting it done, the artist asked me if there were any other tattoos that I wanted to get and I said, why, yes, I do. I wanted to get the computer from Don't Hug Me I'm Scared because I also love that series and because I'm a computer-y guy. And I didn't realize until as I was explaining it to the artist that both of these characters are puppets. So I don't know what that says about my psyche. I never thought that I liked puppets that much, but if anyone wants to psychoanalyze me in the comments, that'd be great. And speaking of YouTube comments, I know a lot of people are going to bring this up, so I'm just going to address it right now. You've probably noticed that Chamberlain isn't holding his iconic triangle scepter. Yeah, I already know that. That's because he's holding the Emperor scepter. It's like my own little head cannon. You got to be the Emperor because he's cool and awesome. Come on, dark crystal fans. You think I don't know my lore? I didn't get the wrong scepter or anything. You think I'd get something wrong about the dark crystal? Okay, you want to know what happened? I own a Chamberlain statue because, of course, I do. And I took pictures of it to send as a reference image to the artist and I totally forgot that I accidentally broke off his triangle scepter. And now because of that, he's holding an entirely different scepter on the tattoo. But you know what? I don't care. This one's better. It's a more clear silhouette. Now, this time when I went to show my parents the tattoo, I don't know exactly what I was hoping for, but I wanted to see some dramatic pearl clutching. You know, just some real disappointment. Chamberlain had to be split up into two sessions and I only got one done when I went to Arizona for a wedding. I saw my mom and she didn't immediately ask me if I had any more tattoos. God didn't tattle on me this time. I told her, mom, I gotta tell you something. Privately, what is it? I need you to keep a secret from grandma. Okay, I'm serious. Grandma can't find out about this. Okay, look, it's Chamberlain and I showed her the unfinished tattoo and she went, oh, do you even like the dark crystal that much? I mean, yeah, the plot's kind of mid, but it's a cool world. Why were you more upset about my fake baby Yoda tattoo than my real dark crystal tattoo? She didn't care and either did my dad. And you know what? I actually showed my grandma too and she liked it. I can't make these people mad no matter what I do. One of my cousins is a tattoo artist and I was talking to him about tattoos and my mom said, oh, you should get your cousin to finish it. And even he said, do not do that. Speaking of tattoo advice, if you're thinking about getting a tattoo, I think you should wait. Obviously, it's your body, your choice, but with the minimum age of tattoos being 18 and in some states 16 with parents permission, I just can't imagine being happy with any tattoos 16-year-old James could think of. All I'm saying is that I'm glad I waited and gave myself time to really know if this is what I wanted. And it was. I know you're young and you want to look as hardcore as possible, but you can still get a tattoo when you're like 23 and it'll look good. Trust me, no matter what tattoo you get, it's a way to express outwardly to the world what you like, what you want to remember, and who you are. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm about to get a full back piece of my grandma's face. There's literally no way my family wouldn't love that. Thank you all for watching this YouTube video and now that you're all done, I'm excited to announce that I have a Funko pop of me. If that's something you're interested in, then you can head on over to my website and you can get a signed Funko while supplies last. As always, thank you to my amazing team and the next time I'll see you, I might have more tattoos, who knows.",My Thoughts on Tattoos,21.09.2024,TheOdd1sOut,man,,12:26,10,"0,9996"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aAGV7G5zbo,Andre," Ellen's trying to make a comeback with her new stand-up special, although its reviews have mostly been terrible. She spends most of the special responding to her being kicked out of showbiz, which began when someone posted just one single tweet. Right now we all need a little kindness. You know, like Ellen DeGeneres always talks about. She's also notoriously one of the meanest people alive. Respond to this with the most insane stories you've heard about Ellen being mean. The tweet posted in March 2020 received bad enough replies to begin Ellen's downfall. I worked at Real Food Daily, served her impotior of brunch. She wrote a letter to the owner and complained about my chip nail polish, not that it was on her plate, but just that it was on my hand. I worked till closing the night before, and this was the next mourn. Almost got me fired. The nail polish story was so unbelievable. The person who wrote it went on Inside Edition. This former waitress claim she was threatened with a two week suspension after Ellen DeGeneres complained about of all things her chip fingernail polish. I remember it as being like, really? But the story shared back on Twitter were only getting worse. I once worked at Warner Brothers. One day I was in the elevator and Ellen and her entourage came in. Naturally, I held it for her and asked her what floor she was getting on. Her assistant answered third floor. 30 minutes later I got a call from my boss, saying I was fired because I was harassing her. An old friend worked on her a lot and smiled and said good afternoon to her one day and she became unhinged. Who do you think you are? You don't look at me Yardiyarda. She said Portia was with her and seemed embarrassed and tried to calm her down. Has forever changed my opinion of her. The responses went on and on and on, all of which being compared to Ellen's classic catchphrase. I always end each show by saying be kind to one another. Audience member Donna DeMateo then went public with her degrading experience on the show. They tell you, you know, you can't be smarter, funnier than Ellen. She's the comedian and the star, not you. Don't be funnier than Ellen. That's gonna be hard considering she's not that funny to begin with. If you've been a comedian your whole life and you're afraid a random audience member will upstage you, maybe you're just not funny. Dana then revealed that Ellen's completely different when the cameras turn off. How does the Ellen we see on TV compared to the Ellen you saw when the cameras stopped rolling? Totally different. She would only speak to the audience when the cameras were rolling. As soon as they turned the cameras off, she would not even acknowledge the audience. She would just sit on the couch basically, which was supported by Heter Muscat, one of the show's former producers. Toxic phony hypocrite liar. That's what she is. She agreed that things were different when the cameras weren't rolling. We were told from the very beginning, don't talk to Ellen. Don't do this. You can't, you know, go into her office. It was very nerve wracking, very stressful. We all walked on egg shells all the time. And after the show's DJ also said the same, Buzzfeed launched their own investigation, interviewing a further 11 former employees. They were fired after taking medical leave or bereavement days to attend family funerals. One employee who claims she was fed up with comments about her race, essentially walked off the job. Others said they were also instructed by their direct managers to not speak to degenerates if they saw her around the office. After the accusations went viral, Ellen issued a statement within the company. Hey everybody, it's Ellen. On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that the Ellen degenerate show would be a place of happiness. No one would ever raise their voice and everyone would be treated with respect. Obviously something changed and I'm disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I'm sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it's the opposite of what I believed and what I hoped for our show where yet Ellen's former producer certainly didn't buy it. So when Ellen says she's not aware of this environment, you don't think that rings true. It's a lie. Ellen then took a two month break and began a brand new season by addressing the public. As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show. I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected. We have made the necessary changes and today we are starting a new chapter. She'd then make the promise and I'm committed to making this the best season that we have ever had. Although the ratings set the opposite because only six months later than New York Times published, Ellen DeGeneres loses one million viewers after apologies for toxic workplace. It explained that Ellen had been averaging 1.5 million viewers over the last six months down from 2.6 million in the same period last year. The show's loss of more than a million viewers translates to a 43% decline representing a steeper drop than any of its competitors. As a result, Ellen made the announcement, I am announcing that next season season 19 is going to be my last season. Adding in the Hollywood Reporter, as great as this show is, and as fun as it is, it's just not a challenge anymore. I need something new to challenge me with her being exposed also clearly having an impact. She'd state the expose destroyed me honestly. I'd be lying if I said it didn't and it makes me really sad that there's so much joy out there from negativity. It's a culture now where there are just mean people, and it's so foreign to me that people get joy out of that. These mean people responded stating, even without the controversy, the show hasn't been fun and genuine for years. It may have never been, but at least it seemed like it. But Ellen is tired of it all, and she's lousy at hiding it now. No more dancing by her, no monologue half the time, bad jokes that are dragged out way too long, tons of old show clips, tons of self promotion, and a guest host every Friday. These elements led to an average final season, which Ellen concluded by crying with her audience. She then mentioned the possibility of returning to acting, but instead made a documentary titled, Saving the Gorillas Ellen's Next Adventure. It released in 2023, but with only 100 reviews on IMDB, and this likely being the first time you've heard of it, it's safe to say it performed pretty poorly. Ellen rather went back to living a quiet life, until April 2024, when she'd make a new announcement. You may have heard that I'm doing stand-up again. If you want to come see me, I'll be sharing some news tomorrow at noon, as suggested she'd announce a stand-up tour, to be recorded and posted by Netflix. Also adding, yes, I'm going to talk about it, referring to her being cancelled. Titled, For Your Approval, This Special begins with Ellen walking up a flight of stairs, each referencing a headline that ruined her reputation. She acknowledges the tweet that started her downfall, as well as the employees who spoke out against her, then begins the actual show with a joke about her fall from Grace. You know, I used to say that I didn't care what other people thought of me, and I realized now looking back, I said that at the height of my popularity. I'm here because I love doing stand-up, I'm misdoing stand-up, and I like making people happy, and I do care what people think. Now, this is a pretty respectable angle, as it feels extremely honest. Yet it also seems like a sneaky request for pity, which as a high-profile celebrity, you'll simply never get. She then talks about what she's been up to. Alright, well let me catch up on what's been going on with me since you saw me last. Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. Then makes some pretty funny jokes about her new reputation. Everybody heard that it was mean, everywhere I go, I know everyone's heard that I'm mean. I know when I walk into a restaurant, people are watching, waiting to see if I'll be mean. Oh look, she's reaching for butter. I thought she was going to hit somebody. On the contrary, there are some pretty out-of-touch segments. For example, her joking about her car features, which she'd clearly only find in a luxury vehicle. She also makes this out-of-touch joke. We're all interested in different things. We're all good at different things. I was talking to someone the other day and they said, Ellen, I don't know how you get on stage in front of people. I could never do that. And I said, well, I don't know how you dry clean clothes. But as an overall, the special isn't terrible. Its audience rating of 5.4 stars feels fairly accurate, although as you might expect simply because it's Ellen, the articles written about it have been pretty brutal. Ellen did generous, unfunny Netflix special, leaves so much on-sad. Ellen did generous lets herself off the hook in self-indulgent Netflix special. Ellen did generous is unapologetic, unrelated and totally insufferable in her new Netflix special. That right, the problem with for-your-approval aside from the fact that it's almost never funny is that it feels so disingenuous so calculated to rehabilitate an image and preserve that triumph for prosperity. Another article stated it's one of the weirder stand-up shows in recent memory. Half-observational punchlines, half-closing argument in a trial, featuring degenerus as her own defense attorney, neither half works on its own, taken as a whole, it's an exhausting mess. That also adds, self-awareness is different from taking responsibility. Degenerus offers no apologies or even explanations for her behavior, yet in other more favourable reviews, unapologetic was used as a positive. I like the fact that she's rather unapologetic. It's highly refreshing and honest. This extreme divide can be seen by the audience reviews on Google. There's almost an equal amount of one and five-star ratings. A sad representation of the black and white thinking that plagues the internet so heavily today.",Ellen Just Tried To Make A Comeback... It's Not Going Well,21.11.2024,SunnyV2,man,,10:10,8,"0,9986"

each settlement you have and two victory points for each city you have if you control the longest road you receive two points and the largest army gives you two as well finally some development cards are worth victory points to set up shuffle the land hexes and evenly distribute them on the table in the shape of a hexagon next place the water ports around the board every other hex making sure the numbers point towards the longest series of land tiles fill in the gaps with blank water hexes next starting at the corner of the board place the numbered tokens on this terrain hexes in alphabetical order proceeding counterclockwise towards the center skipping the desert place the robber token on the desert separate the five different types of resource cards brick or wool lumber and grain and place them face up on the table shuffle the development cards in place facedown on the table everyone chooses a color and takes the corresponding pieces roll dice the highest number goes first players take one turn placing one settlement on any available hex intersection and one adjoining road settlements may not be placed adjacent to another settlement after each player has placed one settlement and road then starting with the last player and going in reverse order players place one more settlement and one more adjoining road after you play your second settlement and road take one resource card for each resource that that settlement is touching the desert and water do not produce resources once every player has placed their second starting settlement and road then the game begins with the starting player and continues clockwise until there is a winner on your turn before you can buy or trade you must roll both dice then based on what number is rolled the corresponding resource hex

2 of the resource of that hex for every city touching it there is no hand size limit however if any player including you rolls a 7 then any player with more than 7 cards must discard half of them down additionally whoever rolled the seven must move the robber to a different terrain Dex the robber may not be returned to the desert nor shall it be moved to a water hex whichever hex you choose place the robber covering the number on that hex showing that the terrain cannot produce resources when that number is rolled when the robber is moved if any other player has a city or settlement touching the affected hex you must pick one card at random from one of their hands and steal it you then continue your turn as normal after you roll dice and collect resources or move the robber you are allowed to trade with other players or the bank and/or buy things only the player whose turn it is can initialize a trade and you can only trade with other players who have resources you cannot gift

to trade three of one resource for one of any other two to one ports allow you to trade two of one very specific resource as indicated by that port for one of any other you don't have to trade if you don't want to you may also buy during your turn pay the bank the proper resources and you can buy roads settlement cities and development cards roads cost one brick and one wood and must be placed between two hexes connecting to one of your existing pieces so long as a road isn't already present if you have the longest continuous road and it is greater than five pieces then you take possession of the longest Road card no matter who has it the longest road is worth two victory points a settlement must be placed on an available intersection connecting to one of your roads no settlement may be adjacent to another settlement or city you may only upgrade one of your existing settlements into a city remove that settlement and replace it with the city anytime during your turn even before you roll you may play a development card you may not use the development card the turn you purchased it you may only play one development card per turn unless it is a victory point then you may reveal as many as you have to allow you to win all the cards say what they do the most common card is the soldier the soldier allows you to move the robber to another space when you play a soldier it plays in front of you and stays there for the rest of the game when it is played in X just like you roll the 7 except it does not affect the number of cards in player's hands if you have the most soldiers in play and that number is greater than 3 then you take control of the largest army card which is worth two victory points if you cannot buy or trade or you choose not to your turn ends and the next

https://youtu.be/oG-UqJbzPp4?si=WnjR8OLQWL8UrbY_,Marysia,War Thunder is a very very bad game to get into there are basically no useful tutorials the UI is cluttered to an insane extend there's too many nations to pick from the economy's terrible and the grind long here are 10 tips that I wish I knew before starting the game tip number One never and I mean never buy silver lines of golden eagles I know it looks like a good deal you get 1.3 million silver lines for 3000 GE and is a total beginner that might seem enticing but please get a premium vehicle instead they are much longer lasting Investments and give you back much more in terms of civil lines and research in the grand scheme of the War Thunder grind 1.3 million is not a lot also don't buy research points with Gold Eagles for the exact same reasons tip number two Don't Buy Low tier premium Vehicles unless you are a big fan of this specific vehicle or plan on playing this VR range a lot there is no point in buying low tier premiums since they are low tiers they give pretty terrible rewards compared to Mid and high tier premiums and they can't really help you grind through the tree sure Rank 2 Premium will allow you to grind faster for rank 1 to 3 but that is actually the easiest part of the grind for some tech trees the entirety of their ranked one and two research is only as much as a single high tier vehicle save up your GE to buy something of a higher rank so it actually helps you tip number three before you buy those High tier premiums watch some tutorials about mechanics of higher tier gameplay a lot of the mechanics you need for high tier plane or tank are explained nowhere and oftentimes don't even have the keybind setup one example of this is radar controls for High T aircraft or thermocytes and Laser rangefinders for tanks you will have a hard time adjusting to the more modern types of vehicles don't make it even harder on yourself by not being prepared tip number four just don't play Naval I mean do I even need to explain this one unless you use a premium boat for Save Alliance farming just play literally anything else watching a 10 hour YouTube video of white noise is probably more interesting tip number five wait for sales before buying Premium Time generally it's a great idea to always wait for the regular sales before buying anything even vehicles but I can understand that people don't want to wait one year until the new height premium is on sale but for premium time you should always wait for a sale a 50 off sale for one year or even 180 days is a great discount and easily lasts you until the next sale tip number six don't buy anything in-game if you're using steam for War Thunder if you only use War Thunder's launcher it's fine but if you're using the steam version like me you are potentially losing unnecessary money when buying certain things in War Thunder this is because steam asks for a certain amount of every purchase you make in games that are offered on Steam and Gaijin decided that it is the best idea to give this extra cost directly to their customers as an example the biggest Golden Eagle pack costs 165 bucks in the steam version while it only costs 114 in their Standalone version you can get around this by simply buying golden eagles and other things on gaijin's website where even steam users will get a fair pricing tip number seven always level up your cruise after a long session of grinding I sometimes have thousands of crew experience points that I forgot to invest this is literally kneecapping your performance as these screws can give you big bony to things like reload speed tour Traverse speed crew survivability and tank repair speed don't forget to do this on a regular basis tip number eight joining a squadron is necessary if you want to unlock certain Vehicles without spending real world money it is important that you do this as early in your War Thunder career as possible if you need to find a good Squadron join my Discord ask me directly to make space for you in my personal Squadron it's very active so you can be sure to earn those Squadron research points the link to my Discord is in the video description and in the pinned comment tip number nine stay informed about events you can earn quite powerful and relatively high-ranking vehicles that are in the regular summer and winter events and they will cost nothing to unlock if you don't want to keep them you can oftentimes sell them for Gaijin coin on the market which can be spent to get golden eagles or other event Vehicles this is an easy way to quickly get access to high-ranking Vehicles tip number 10 use your boosters oftentimes when I get a silver line or research point booster I tend to forget about them and miss out on earning more rewards for free many people are also hesitant to use their boosters in fear of Performing bad in the next game and the booster going to waste in my opinion Don don't be scared and just always use them even if you activate a booster and perform bad in the next game over the span of many days and many boosters it will eventually average out don't worry about those few bad times as the saying goes you win some you lose some that's it for today's video and thank you for watching,10 Tips I WISH I Knew Before Starting War Thunder,15.07.2023,Goodboi,man,30s,05:17,10,
https://youtu.be/CToVsdKOX5w?si=rGFuDlSqPxYu4Jl3,Marysia," hello summoners and welcome back to another pro guys video my name is saskio and today we'll be going over the abilities of the newest league champion vexx as always anything on the pbe is subject to change but let's talk about everything we know so far unlike auction vex has a surprisingly small amount of text in her ability description for a champion released in season 11. but looking at gwen you don't need a lot of words to be a strong champion now let's jump into her kit vex's passive is called doom and glow the first part doom periodically empowers vex's basic abilities to interrupt dashes and fear enemies the second part of her passive gloom marks enemies that use a dash or blink with gloom vex's next basic attack against a marked enemy detonates the mark dealing bonus damage and refunding a part of doom's cooldown this passive is a core part of vex's identity being able to interrupt dashes and fear enemies with a basic ability is really powerful especially since it gives you cc on any of your other skills when vex is glowing green you better be careful the second part literally just gives you free damage and depending on the numbers and cooldown reduction vex might get her enhanced abilities very quickly if she's facing someone mobile like irelia or even yasuo before we talk about the rest
called mistral bolt she launches a wave forward dealing magic damage to enemies it passes through after a short delay the wave accelerates but has a reduced width mistral bull also detonates gloom on any marked enemies that it hits like most champions vex's q will be her bread and butter ability the speed and timing is really interesting and it'll probably surprise players during the first few weeks of release because her q can proc the extra damage from her passive it's crucial that you land this on as many people as possible so you aren't overlapping your glue marks moving on to vex's w personal space this ability is really good on a squishy mage when used vex gains a shield and emits a shock wave dealing magic damage to enemies around her personal space also detonates gloom on any marked champions this w is a really solid ability for peeling both herself and her teeth because her doom passive recharges over time in the mid and late game vex will almost always have her fear up just in case she gets caught out having an instant fear and shield is great on any champion and being able to proc her gloom mark makes a simple ability even more powerful alright let's talk about her e looming darkness vex says shadow flies to a location increasing in size as it travels on arriving shadow deals magic damage slows and marks enemies hit with gloom i'd say another normal looking ability something important to note here is that vex's e actually applies a mark of gloom instead of consuming it if you want to maximize your damage it's crucial that you don't overlap your marks luckily this ability has a pretty decent travel time so you should be able to weave in an auto attack to trigger your gloom before applying it again now let's talk about everyone's favorite part the ultimate vex's r is called shadow surge shadows fly forward marking and dealing magic damage to the first enemy champion hit vex can then recast his abilities have shadow pull her to the marked target dealing additional magic damage if the marked target dies within a short time of taking damage from shadow surge vex can cast shadow surge again within a few seconds on paper this ability reminds me of an ultimate version of the snowball from aram one important thing to know is that you can only get the reset if you kill an enemy shortly after they take damage from the ultimate if you get a random assist while your else is on cooldown it won't reset my favorite part about this ability that works really well with the rest of vex's kit you can jump in on any champion that needs to w for a huge aoe fear or you can try to wait until you see an enemy get low to chase down the kill speaking of vex's kit let's talk about our first impressions vex is a breath of fresh air in terms of both champion design and abilities she's the first female yordle we've gotten in almost 10 years and her abilities aren't walls of text either the cool thing about vex is that unless her numbers are just insane her power will change depending on the enemy team if the enemy team has no dashes or blinks you actually lose a pretty big chunk of your damage because you won't get a lot of glue marks less glue marks mean you won't be able to reduce the cooldown of your fear which will leave you dealing less damage and having less cc but honestly i think that's totally fine vex's e still applies gloom and let's be honest i can't name the last game of league of legends that didn't have a champion with a dash even if the enemy has 5 champions with dashes maximizing your damage is going to be a lot of work juggling your empowered auto attacks with your q and w will give vex a ton of damage if done correctly so let's see what the best players can come up with and that's everything we've got

https://youtu.be/1M6KNfc5-NU?si=wDFaaqC6XaRc9nwc,Marysia,"over the past few years I've created several online businesses that generated multiple six figures in profit each and today I'll be spilling all my secrets I'll be sharing how to start a profitable online business from scratch from choosing a product to branding to advertising to put it to the test I'll be creating a brand new business alongside you step by step and I'll even share with you some AI tools to make things easier step one product what product should I sell this is often the first question new entrepreneurs focus on the problem is that's what causes most of them to fail all that you've been told is wrong your first question shouldn't be what product should I sell your first question should be what problem can I solve it doesn't matter how cool or fancy your product is if it doesn't solve a real problem that people care about it's not going to sell well there are four ways to find a problem to start a business around the first way is through yourself start by examining your own life and interest what problems have you faced what skills do you have that you could help others with the second way is through chat GPT you can ask it for a list of problems to start a business around and it'll actually generate some good ideas you can then keep asking is to dive deeper and deeper into specific categories to find problems that you're interested in tackling the Third Way is through Target markets AKA A specific group of people out there that you could sell to for example people who go to the gym think about what they're struggling with and what you could solve for them you can use chat gbt to come up with Target markets and list out their problems if you feel your target market is too broad and diverse keep niching down on their demographics and interests instead of all gym goers what about women aged 18 or 24 or people who practice yoga or people who work out at the playground get specific and specific problems will come up the fourth way is through existing businesses and products you can gain inspiration from the problems they're trying to solve you can find ideas on Google YouTube and Tick Tock where a good hashtag you could search is hashtag Tick Tock made me buy if you're thinking of Drop Shipping or working with a manufacturer you can browse Alibaba and AliExpress and find products there you can also explore services and digital products remember focus on the problem not the product it's the easiest way to tell if something will sell or not once you land on a real problem you can then decide on a product you can sell to solve it for the business we're creating together I was browsing Alibaba and saw this electric pot and it sparked a real problem that I had in University back in first year I always wanted to eat late in the evening after a long day of studying the problem was my small dorm had no kitchen appliances and my residence dining hall always closed early the food there wasn't that great either and it was expensive so I always wish there was a way to cook in my dorm this electric pot would have solved all my problems I could cook at any time I could cook noodles eggs Lobster I like this this has potential with the problem and a product we can now go to step two target market it's now time to figure out who has your problem that's willing to purchase your product you may already have an idea but sometimes a problem and product can be shared by a lot of different people in which you're going to want to Niche down on a smaller target market so you can stand out in the case of our electric pot this product could be handy for a range of people Travelers campers office workers but instead of selling to all of them I'm gonna Niche down to that Target Market related to my original problem University students who live in dorms without kitchen appliances now how do you determine if a target market is a good one to sell to or not it comes down to three factors one market size how big is this group of people it shouldn't be too big where it includes everyone but it shouldn't be too small either there are a lot of University students out there living in dorms so for our electric pot I think we have a pretty good Market size typically the bigger the market the more money there is on the table however it usually brings along more competition which is the second Factor how many competitors are out there selling your product to the same target market are they established and professional if there's a lot it's going to be harder for you to stand out and sell while there are a lot of electric pot Brands out there I don't find many of them specifically marketing towards University students the third factor is profitability is this target market actually willing to spend their hard-earned dough on your product and if so how much profit is there to be earned note that a small Market size or high competition doesn't always mean it's not profitable maybe each person has a lot of money to spend or there's so much demand that it doesn't even matter if if there are a lot of competitors it really depends profitability wise for the electric pot it's decent University students are typically broke but being that this product is genuinely useful and can save the money it could sell well if the pricing is Right parents may also see the benefit of this product and buy it for their children for help you can ask chatgpt to weigh the pros and cons of a certain target market most new entrepreneurs and really all entrepreneurs will likely keep going back and forth between step one and step two for a while deciding on a product and a target market while it is important don't get stuck here for too long most of the time you actually have to start the business first to get the answers it's always better to start with an imperfect product and target market and change things later on versus never starting at all let's now move on to step three platform you're building an online business so of course you'll be selling your product online but where online will it be through a Marketplace like Amazon eBay or Etsy these platforms come with an existing customer base that can help bring traffic to your product but they come with fees competition next to your listing and limited customization for your brand the the other type of platform would be your own website it gives you complete control over your branding has fewer fees and can really make your business look legit however you need to build the website and you have to drive traffic to it through marketing the best type of platform to choose will really depend on your product and the way you're going to advertise it which we'll get into later what I will say is that you can never go wrong with having your own website let's begin by grabbing a domain name I was thinking we name our product dormpot you know a pot for dorms simple straightforward catchy let's try for dormpot.com and nope it's taken who even has it this website is literally a blank page come on finding a good.com domain name these days has just gone hard instead I think I'm gonna go with a domain that's been trending on the online streets dot store dot store is a domain meant exclusively for online stores it tells people your website is a store and instantly Associates it with selling it has over 1 million businesses celebrities and influencers using it including Rihanna Maroon 5 Discord favorite Castel Dude Perfect Zach King and Cristiano Ronaldo it's been found that almost 70 percent of domain name availability checks on.com fail but with DOT store there is a huge pool of good and short domain names available which means you don't need to compromise let's check if dormplot.store is available and it is oh it's got a ring to it you can buy Dot store domain at any registrar like GoDaddy or namecheap or a website builder like Shopify or Wix or being
our website there are plenty of e-commerce website Builders out there like Shopify Wix and Squarespace they all have their pros and cons so feel free to choose one that fits your needs the best for dornpot I'll be using Wix now I won't be diving too much into the details of creating an e-commerce website in this video if you want to learn more you can check out my detailed video tutorial here the gist is to make sure the website looks good and professional don't have it looking like a scam okay take inspiration from other websites and keep things minimal and streamlined you don't need too much on there just words and media to help you sell your product and showcase step four branding having a strong brand is essential to connecting with customers a brand is what separates a business from some dude selling random things online a blank website is a great canvas to start building your brand off of because it's very visual when designing a website you can build your brand along with it there are four branding elements you need to determine before launching your business starting with your name my recommendation is to keep it simple something that isn't confusing and can be searched easily especially as an online business people are going to type your name with dormpot it's kind of basic but it instantly gets the project across and works great online if someone searches for an electric pot for dorms they'll likely come across dorm pod next your logo your logo should give off the personality of your company again keep it simple it can be an image but it can also just be text if you want a quick way to create a logo you can use AI art generators like mid-journey or Leonardo to generate one for you and boom that looks good next up visual identity this refers to everything else that's visual your Brand's color palette font imagery the looking packaging of your product all this is going to influence how people will perceive your business everything should be catered towards your target market for dormplot we definitely want to have a young casual University feel to it since we're targeting University students so I'm going to use a range of colors modern fonts and fun imagery and lastly messaging this is probably the most critical and most overlooked part of a brand what it says to its target market people resonate with businesses that solve their problems so you're going to want to craft all of your Brand's messaging to evolve around that for instance dornpot's key message is going to be real simple it's a convenient and affordable way to cook in your door all of my messaging from the home page to the product page is all going to focus on this aspect as it touches on the problems that this target market has if you need help with any of these branding elements ask chatgpt it can basically write a whole branding strategy for you okay the website and branding are all done it's now time to go to the battlefield let's begin step five promotion this step will decide whether your business will live or die if you can stick through and figure out a way to successfully Market your business you win there are many different marketing channels to choose from to promote your online business paid ads search engine optimization email marketing affiliate marketing the list goes on while your business should eventually grow to utilize several channels the one I recommend you go all in on at the start is social media marketing right now the best way to promote your business is through short form content tick tocks Instagram reels YouTube shorts the algorithm is boosting those right now and it's just so much easier to grab eyeballs through them versus traditional YouTube videos or Instagram posts for example with dormpot what I do to promote it would be to make videos like this guy this guy just Cooks all kinds of food with his electric pot on his college bed and it's genius it's weird and engaging it's very authentic and it demonstrates the product perfectly where people are begging to buy the electric pot and that's the thing this guy is selling the electric pot through his website in his bio that was his plan all along that's how you do it some products are naturally visual like the dorm pot but some aren't so you'll have to get creative once you get the hang of social media marketing you can then consider other marketing channels like paid ads most of the time people just jump straight into paid ads when they don't even know how to craft a good social media post you're basically throwing money away at that point after going to Market and hopefully getting some sales it's finally time for step six adjust and iterate you're likely not going to get everything right on your first try maybe the problem you chose wasn't actually that big of a problem maybe you're focusing on the wrong target market maybe Tick Tock isn't actually the best way to promote your product expect to fail and expect to change things if you keep working on this steps I mentioned I can almost promise you that you will eventually land on a profitable online business and there you have it I wish you the best of luck with your business if you want to see me start a real business from scratch using these exact same steps be sure to like this video subscribe if you haven't already and peace out",Easiest Way To Start An Online

https://youtu.be/D_-nhx14rjo?si=Qlhlyk6hfDGbnBrn,Marysia,"When it comes to making money online, it seems like there are so many people giving false information and scams out there. So in today's video, I'm going to share with you some real credible information on the best online businesses to start as an absolute beginner. Now in this video, I'm going to share with you three very specific online business models. The first one is going to be the very easiest one. So if you have no skills and you want to start something today that's actually going to work. This is the business model for you. The second online business in this video, again, is going to be a very easy one that you can start today. And then the third one has the potential to make you the most money the fastest. Now, for all three of these online businesses, I have made full step-by-step tutorials, totally for free on my YouTube channel. This is typically the part that most people miss. They tell you about a business idea, but they don't teach you how to do it unless you pay for the course or something like that. So guys, just before we jump into this video, I do wanna just take one quick second to give you some credibility about myself. If you are anything like me, whenever I'm getting financial advice or business advice from someone, I need to see the proof before I'm taking any of their advice to heart. So I've personally done all three of these business models and over the years of doing them, I've made something like $3 million in profit. These business models absolutely work. I've been in the trenches learning them inside and out. And in the videos on my channel, you will see exactly what I've done to get to my level of profit. So you can do it as well. Alright guys, without further ado, let's get straight into the first one here. And all I ask is if you do find yourself enjoying this video as you're watching it, please just give it a thumbs up and let me know down in the comments. Okay? So starting with the very first business model, like I said, this is the easiest one that anyone can start today. Let me switch you over to the computer and show you this one. So what this one is is Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing. Now, you may have seen this called Amazon KDP, and essentially what this is is where you can create books and sell them on Amazon. Now, I don't want you to think that you have to write full books for this. You can actually create daily planners or blank journals, all different types of books, and you can sell those on Amazon with KDP. So I'll put up a really big list here of different ideas that you can create KDP books with, and then I'll show you some real examples in my hand. So hopefully this list gives you some brainstorming ideas of different types of books you can create. But here are some real examples. So this is a password logbook. Every page in here is the same and it's just formatted to keep track of your passwords. Another example here is just a journal with blank pages where people can keep notes, but it has a funny cover on it. And then some of my favorites here, these are word search books. So if you know how to create word searches, which in the free tutorial I was talking about on this channel, it'll show you exactly how to do that. You can create books like this where they are themed word searches and sell those on Amazon. Now the thing that I love so much about this business model is all we have to do is create this actual arc file on our computer front and back for the covers, and then what's going to be on each page. And if you have the right software, you can create all this so easily and you upload those files to Amazon and then that creates a virtual listing of this product. And when someone purchases it, Amazon actually prints this physical book and ships it out to the customer. We don't have to print anything, we don't even take care of customer service. It's all done on Amazon. So let me quickly switch you over to the computer and show a real example of this. On Amazon, if you type in word search books, which is ones that I was just showing you here, this is going to be all results. And for the vast majority of these, they're going to be done with Amazon KDP. So if you click on one of these listings, which just looks like a normal Amazon listing, this is actually done with KDP. So the person who is selling this only created this front cover here, the back cover, and then you don't even see what is inside. Besides that it has 131 pages, but when someone purchases this, Amazon will print it and ship it out to them and they will receive something like this. So guys, as a total beginner, if you know how to create these covers and what's inside of the books, which I show you totally for free in that tutorial, you can come up with so many different ideas to create these word searches or any other types of journals that you want to create, and you can upload them directly to Amazon. Now, there is so much more that I'd like to talk about for this business model, but I really wanna keep this video moving along. Trust me when I say there are very few business models out there besides the ones on this list that you can start for very low risk. You don't have to spend any money on advertising or marketing, and you can start making money within the first month that you start. So guys, if you do want to start Amazon KDP, there's a full step-by-step tutorial linked down in the description. However, let's get into the second business model. Alright, so moving into the second online business that I highly recommend. This one is slightly harder to do than Amazon KDP, but it is still definitely classified as one that is easy to start. What this business is called is called Print on Demand. Now, if you haven't heard of Print on Demand before, it is very similar to Amazon KDP, but instead of creating books, you're creating t-shirts. Now, if this is a business model that I have a ton of experience with, I've literally been doing this one for just about 10 years now. This is a business model that has proven time and time again to work. So let me quickly switch you over to the computer and show you a real example of this just to tie it all together. So if we come back over to Amazon, again, this is just going to be the largest Print on Demand marketplace out there, but there are several other Print on Demand marketplaces you can sell on as well. With that being said, if you type in something like funny fishing shirt just as just for an example, you can type in any type of t-shirt and you scroll down here, you're going to see these kind of funny graphic t-shirts. Now for all of these that have the same mockup, so you'll notice this kind of black or it could be a different color t-shirt mockup that looked the same. So this one and this one, if you keep scrolling down here, you're going to see the same mockup, the same mockup. These are all being done with Print on Demand. So if we just click on one of these, again, just like Amazon KDP, the person who created this only uploaded this design here, and then Amazon created this listing. Whenever someone places an order, Amazon will print it and ship it out to the customer and take care of all the customer service for you. Now, what's cool is as you're looking around Amazon just doing some research on this, anytime you see this little label right here, Amazon Merch on Demand, that means that this listing is being done with Print on Demand. So just like Amazon KDP, you set your pricing so you get to determine how much money you make per sale, and then anyone can come in here, they can choose what kind of shirt they want that printed on, what color, what size, and they can add it right to their cart and they can purchase it even with Amazon Prime Shipping. Now a couple really important things about Print on Demand. First, I would say that it is very similar to Amazon KDP. The only main difference is that in order to be a seller for Amazon Print on Demand, you have to actually apply to be a seller. So if you go over to Google, you type in Amazon Merch on Demand, it'll bring you to this page, and this is where you actually sign up to be a Print on Demand seller on Amazon. So once you see this sign up button, you just click on that, it goes through a very quick application and then you have to wait up to 14 days to hear back from Amazon to see if you are approved or not. Now the bit of good news here is that while you're waiting from Amazon to hear back, there are a couple other big Print on Demand marketplaces that you can also sell your designs on, and you can start on those right away. You don't have to apply to be a seller. Now those websites and how to apply to Amazon, all the information for Print on Demand business is going to be in a full print on demand tutorial linked down in the description as well. That is going to be totally free here on the YouTube channel. Now with that being said, I would say the number one issue or obstacle people run into when starting Print on Demand is how to actually create designs if you don't have graphic design experience. So this is something that I've learned over the years of doing this, but there are graphic design tools out there where you can type in something like fishing. Let's create a fishing t-shirt. You give that a search and you have all of these different t-shirt templates that you can then start customizing and you can use those for your print on demand designs.

https://youtu.be/CtdHBM35cVs?si=jg4Nd8wcTUR7qhKY,Marysia,"they're the type of fruit that just give and give and give and what do i mean by that well there's so many applications that stem from a coconut you can extract the coconut water and from the meat you can make your own coconut milk or coconut oil and you can also dehydrate the coconut meat and keep it for pretty much six months to one year and after you break down this coconut you're gonna be left with a souvenir for years to come so without further ado let's get into the kitchen and i'm going to show you how to break down this coconut and don't worry we're not going to need any hammers or screwdrivers for this one all right so here is our coconut and each coconut is going to have these germination holes and there's always going to be three of them and this is where we're going to extract our coconut water from so the tool i'm going gonna be using to extract the coconut water is this corkscrew right here and i'm gonna insert my corkscrew into one of the holes and with each coconut there's always gonna be one of the holes that are a lot softer than the other two so you're gonna have to kind of test them out [Music] so to ensure my coconut water comes out nice and clean i'm gonna add a sieve on top of my glass before pouring my coconut water in and depending on the hole you made and the coconut sometimes it'll come out in these small drips and sometimes it'll come out in a nice thin stream [Music] and here is our much needed vacation in a glass [Music] [Music] all right moving on to opening up our coconut so we're gonna use the spine of our knife we're not gonna use the blade no no no that is dangerous we're gonna use the spine and we're gonna focus around the equator of our coconut and we're gonna pivot our body so we don't hit ourselves with that knife we just want to hammer that coconut with the spine of our knife and we're just gonna keep using the spine of our knife to hammer that coconut's equator and as you can see there's a crack forming once you've made that crack all the way through it'll just open like so and next i'm going to show you how to remove the meat from this coconut so just put it onto a tray and we're going to bake this at 400 degrees for 15 minutes [Music] and once you remove it from the oven just place it down on your cutting board and let it cool for about five minutes and you're going to take a butter knife or paring knife and you're going to put it in between the shell and the meat of the coconut and we want to kind of pry it out so you're just going to insert it in between and turn your knife until it just kind of pops out and then we'll do that with the second half of the coconut [Music] and then you're gonna be left with these two coconut shells and these make for some really cool serving bowls next we're going to take a peeler and we're just going to remove that thin layer of brown coconut skin
and there is our coconut meat and i'm just gonna rinse this now under water and there is our cleaned coconut all right now i'm gonna show you how to preserve your coconut so with the rim of the coconut you want to shave off these flakes here and then you're going to put these flakes onto a baking tray and you're going to put this into your oven at the lowest temperature setting possible at least 150 degrees or lower if possible and you're gonna dehydrate these for about one to two hours until they can easily snap when you bend them so that is it pretty straightforward if you found yourself with a whole coconut in your fridge and didn't know how to proceed then i really hope this video helped and fresh coconut meat is amazing as an addition to your smoothies or you can shave it like i showed you in the video and add it to a caribbean inspired salad so if you like content like this or if you like videos like this if you like my channel definitely subscribe and comment down below on what kind of fruits and vegetables you want to see me break down so i'm out of here and that is it for today's video but until next time keep on cooking",How to Open a Coconut & Remove the Meat (No Hammer/Screwdriver Needed),24.11.2020,Better Cook,man,30s,06:49,10,
https://youtu.be/eIHDcPS38N4?si=xQRV29XhuBRSEEpR,Marysia,what's going on guys geek sauce here today we're going to take apart this xbox one s controller um i've opened it up already it's a little bit different compared to the original xbox one controller but not by not by a long shot it's just a little a couple different things here and there so um without further ado oh let's say first of all the tools you're gonna need some kind of little plastic tool like this i'm not sure the correct term for this tool but i got it off ifixit.com you can also use a guitar pick that will work just as well um i got a torx screw here and i got a whole uh array of them here because there are two different kinds of um torque screws in this controller so first what you're going to want to do is take the batteries out don't want to have them in there or your charge pack which would probably have that instead and then first thing we got to do is take off the sides here so what i like to do is come in from the bottom here and oops just slowly pry pry this off up i'm not getting this from a good angle here there we go you'll hear it clicking you're not breaking it just be careful with it and then once i get it like this i usually just you know you at this point you can just pull it off like that so i'll do the same here for this side all right now that we got that done you have one two three four five screws to take off um this is going to avoid your warranty as you can see i've already cut it um so just you know i'm sure if you're watching this video you do plan on taking yours apart anyway either to to clean it get some beer out of it or maybe your dog pissed in it who knows okay now that you have those screws taken out it's simply just lifting this off getting that out of the way put it in a secure place so you don't scratch it um and then the same goes for the back you can just lift it off and here is where you're going to need uh to use your soldering gun if you do plan on taking these um these vibrators off we have a couple connections here with them uh the actually the right trigger and left trigger by have vibrators in them so you can see that runs down and runs to right here the original vibrators are on on the bottom so take note of it take a picture of it with your phone before you start to solder them off so you know exactly where to put them when you're done okay now that we have those connections uh taken off let's you can remove these and put them aside and then also while we're here we should take off this connection right here as well so here you have a couple more screws one here and one here and once we take these off this uh back part will just lift right off okay with those two taking off we should be able to just pull this up i like to oh that came up easier than i thought it was if you need to just wiggle it back and forth and that will come right up okay so we have one two or well here one two three four five and six so we'll go ahead and take the oh also note this is loose in here now i did not realize that the first time it's just dangling in here so i mean it it goes in here like this so it's very easy but you don't want to lose that or drop it and then you can't find it because you dropped it on the ground and it's lost forever so just take that and put it somewhere safe okay now to get this off you're going to want to take off this middle piece you can actually take that off before you start hammering away at these screws and that's just because this this board doesn't want to come out here come out while this middle piece is in here so we can take our plastic tool wherever it is and you can just simply pry these up a little bit and you'll see it will pop right off and actually the entire unit came off but that didn't happen the first time now we can just simply pull this up and out of here and that's the last pcb be careful you don't want to just turn this upside down right away you will spill them everywhere so i just pick them out one by one all right so on the front here um you just have to um simply just peel back a little bit on this metal clip and just wiggle it off to take that off to get the d-pad out and that's it you can go one step further if you need to um to take out these the the trigger vibrators um i'm not going to do it you just have to take out that torx screw and you can simply just you know take it apart and everything will will come off so that's it that's the xbox one s controller completely disassembled thanks for watching the video if you have any questions feel free to ask them in the comments if you like the video like it and please subscribe thanks for watching,Xbox One S Controller Disassembly 2016,03.09.2016,The Money Mentor,man,40s,07:24,10,
,Josy,"
Hi. So I'm just going to talk to you about card games and playing different card games. Specifically the 2 that I know very well and play a lot are Romy and poker. So So let's start with the card deck. So there's 52 cards in a card deck. Each one is unique. So there's 4 different suits in a card deck, which means that, per suit, there is 14 cards. I'm pretty sure. So that starts with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, queen, king, and ace. Okay. It's 13, actually. The 4 different suits are, there's the clover, there is diamond, there's hearts. And then there is, I forgot the last one. Wait a second. The last one is Spades. So there's spades, clubs, hearts, and diamonds in, a card deck. So for poker and rummy, usually you need 2 card deck, which means there's a 104 cards. Let's start with poker. So poker, you play with chips, which equal to money and poker is usually a gambling game. I don't use it to gamble. I use it to play with my friends. We usually don't play with money, which we just use the chips for fun. Like, Oh, whoever wins is just mostly for the ego boost. So the point in poker is to try to get the best hand. A hand is made out of 5 cards. Overall, you can see 7 cards. So your hand should be made up the out of the 5 best cards. So it starts with the dealer. He mixes the cards very shuffles the cards very well and deals everyone 2 cards. So then you have 2 cards on your deck. You will look at those cards and you think, oh, are they good? A good card would, for example, be a high card because high cards are always beat a lower card. So an ace is always gonna beat a king, a queen, a jack, 10, and anything below. So it's always good to have a higher card. And then if you have the same suit, same suit is also good because that could mean you could perhaps get a flush. For example, having 2 diamonds would be good. The best of course would be having, oh, I actually forgot. You don't play with 2 decks. That's only Romeo and poker. You only play with 1 deck. So that's 52 cards. So there's 4 of each card. There's 4 sevens, 4 eights, 4 nines, 4 kings, 4 queens, 4 jacks, which is very important for you to predict what other players could have. Because the game is all about bluffing and predicting. So you put so once you look at your 2 cards, you could either put unless you're the big or small blind. Big or small blind always have to put, but let's not talk about that. So if you see your cards and you think they're good, for example, you have a king and an ace, doesn't matter, suit, those are good cards. So if you, have a pair of that, you could win, but you can only have pairs in the next round. So once people say whether they're gonna go with a round or not, so putting chips or not, people could raise. So for example, if you have 2 aces, you'd be like, oh, well I think I have the best card. So I definitely think I'm gonna win. Let me put in more money. And then people are gonna look at their cards again and think, oh no, that's I don't have good enough cards. She probably has better cards. I should not go. Or you think, oh no, my cards are good. I think I have better cards than her. So you always only gonna go unless when you, if you think you have better cards than the person next to you or the person at the table or you're bluffing. So that's another big thing in poker. People always bluff because you don't know the cards of others players. You never know when they're bluffing or not. So unless you have the best cards, there's always a chance they could have better cards. So then if they put them more and be like, oh no, my cards are not that good. Let me not go. But then when we get to the next round, the dealer puts down 3 other cards. So now you could create actual hands. So for example, if there's a king and you have a king, you have a pair. So if no one else has a pair, you you won. You have the best. Or if there's 2 kings and you have a king, that's 3 of a kind. So it's it goes from high card to pair to, I think, 2 pairs and then 3 of a kind and then straight. And then so straight would be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, but the better straight, the better. So if you have a 2, 3, 4, 5, and then they have a 3, 4, 5, 6, they won, rather than you. So you have 3 cards and you, on the table and 2 and you can think, oh, I think that's good. But the end, there's gonna be 5 cards on the table. So out of those 5 cards and your cards, whoever has the best combination wins. So then let's say you see a king, you have a king. I don't think anyone has been any better. You again, raise and put more money in. And then people again will will say, no, I'm not going or I am going, and this continues. Yeah. And then there's another card, put down and again, you see, oh, I think I better have not in the last card. And it's always about putting in money, calling, which is when someone puts the money and then you put that in the same money checking when no one puts the money and everyone checks just to see the next card or raising. And that was not a great explanation actually, but it's the best I can do right now. ",,,,,,,,
,Josy,"Hi. So I wanna explain, the rules of chess. So in chess, there are the white and the black pieces. Each piece each, color has the same amount of pieces, but your opposing team. So chess can only be played by 2 players on a chess board. The oh. So the chess board, is made out of 64 squares which is 8 rows by 8 columns which means that there are 16 pieces per team. So the pieces are made up of first 8, 8 pawns. So the pawns kind of when when you start on your 8 by 8 board, so it's also there's like notation of chess. So there's like a, b, c, d, e, f, g, b, c, h, and then there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So when you're moving a piece if you want to write it down you go like 2, b2 or g3 to note where you're moving your piece. So yeah when you start there's you your pieces are taking up the first two and the last two rows of the chessboard. White o is always the first two and white also always starts. So this means that the the pawns, they're on the second row, so they're on 2 a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and the black pieces are on 7 a, b, c, d, e, f, g. Yeah. Exactly. And then so this means that when you are, playing, you move your pieces based on that. So you need to first move your pawns to be able to move any other piece other than the, knight because the knight can jump over pieces. Every other piece moves linear, so they if something's blocking it, it can't move past it. But the pawns can only move one step at a time, except at their first step. The first step, they can move 2 steps at the time if they wanted to. Then the other pieces are the king. So the king is basically what you need to protect. So if your king gets checkmated, so that's when 2 other pieces could, could kill it, that means checkmate. Then your queen, your queen is your most powerful piece, so you also need to protect it a lot because your queen can move however many steps at once forwards, left, right, and diagonally. However, you can only move once per turn. And the pawn, it sorry. Going back to the pawn, the pawn takes diagonally. The queen can take however it want wants. Then there's the bishops. They only move diagonally, and they take diagonally. The knight, which move in kind of an l, which means they go forward 3 and then, no forward 2 and then to the right one, or left one, or they can go like back to so yeah. Like yeah. So just left so northeast, southwest, 2, and then, from that, northeast, southwest, 1. So kind of just an l shape in whatever whichever direction they want. And then there is the rook which is also quite a powerful piece and it can move forward backwards left and right giving it a lot of domination over the board. However, it is tucked in in a corner so it's hard to get it out in 1st place. Some other things that you need to note is that you can castle, which means moving the if you have your bishop and your knight out of the way, you can move your king and rook and kind of swap positions of them, which is, quite interesting and can be quite good when using it when playing. And then overall, it's just taking of the pieces of the other player and then making sure to protect your own. So never leaving your piece to be able to be taken without some way to take it back, to take that piece back. Also, there, each piece is given a, a value. So with the pawns being least valuable to the queen, and the king being the the king, I mean, doesn't really have a value because if it's gone, you're gone to the queen being the most. So you would never let someone take your queen to only take their pawn. You'd wanna take something worth the same value, which with queen is hard. So rook has after the queen the most value at 5, and bishops and knights are 3, and pawn is 1, and I think the queen is 8. So yeah that's a horrible explanation by me of chess but that's just all the beginner stuff you need to know.",,,,,,,,
,Marysia,"Hey, so today I'm going to talk about a new project that I'm doing. So basically I'm just trying to create like some stamps curving the linoleum and then I'm just going to put the stumps on maybe some clothes. Or some bags or whatever, and then I can have like my own, like my personal design. And yeah, and that's something that I'm that I'm working on right now. So basically I can just show you the the stamps that I made so far and talk about it a bit more. So you can understand. So the first one that I have here is this small star that I made. It's one of the first stamps that. That I ever made. So as you can see, it's not great. It's not the best. I think I'm just gonna make a new one because this one is a bit like rough and and and not really precisely done. UM, the other thing that I have here is a small alien and a smile. Those are a bit better. I haven't tried them with paint yet, so it's hard to say if if it's actually OK, but it looks fine to me now, but I will try that later today. The other one. Also, a new one is this small snake that I'm just gonna use for some like background in my design. I also haven't tried this one yet. But we'll see. The next one is this skeleton with the flower instead of a head. I haven't finished this one yet. As you can see, the background is still yet to be curved, but it looks fine. I think it's like one of the biggest pieces that I've made. So far, so I'm really excited because that would be like a centerpiece of some of my designs. The next one it's also, I mean it's this big Scorpio, it's also one of the fairest of my designs and it's with with a different kind of linoleum and  it's way softer and easier to work with. So it was, it was really  enjoyable. To work with this, but I can't find this linoleum anymore. And now I'm working with this, way, way harder one. But yeah, the next one is this small spider. So it's it's I think that's like my newest piece probably. And it's also I haven't tried this one yet, so we'll see how it goes. Next I have this small bouquet of flowers. I've tried this one. I mean it's really small, but you know, just to put it in the background or something, I think it should. Fine. And this one is also one of the first pieces. It's also with the softer linoleum. I've tried this one, but it used to be with the background and now I removed everything, so it's just the flower and I haven't tried it with. Like without the background, so we'll. See here I have this small cloud, but honestly I don't really like it. I could work on the inside a bit more. I feel like because it's it's very simple but it's. I don't know. I don't really like it. And then I have this small tree here also just to add something in the background. But it's really nice. Then I have this mushroom that I actually really enjoyed doing for some reason, and it turned out really well, so that's nice. And here I have all of the letters. I made the whole alphabet. And then I think I'm just going to put some text on the design and then you know the the symbols around it, I'm just going to arrange it somehow and hopefully it's gonna look nice, but I haven't tried it on clothes yet, just on paper, because I still need to work on it, I mean, I. Still need to figure out what kind of paint I want to use because the one that I have now is acrylic and it's a bit too. I don't know, like too watery or something it just doesn't really work well, but we'll see about that. ",,,,,,,,
,Marysia,"hi guys, today I'm gonna tell you what I do for a living. So, I'm gonna get you through my whole workday. It's nine hours long, so it's a lot to do. So, the first thing, I put some music on, then I have to start cleaning, so I vacuum, I mop the floor, I give some water to our cafe, I put all of the pillows outside, the tables outside, some of the vinyls outside because we also sell vinyls and we have like a little vinyl stand or whatever. And then I need to unload the dishwasher and yeah, basically start the unloading. I start all the machines, the coffee grinders, the ice machine. I take all the cakes from the fridge and the freezer. I make a nice display of the cakes and the cookies and everything. And then I need to check if we have all the ingredients and like all Like, types of milk that we use. Usually we don't have anything, so i have to go to a store. And, um, yeah. Um, yeah, and then i come back, and i just wait for the first customer to come in. And then i just pretend that i'm working. um Yeah, I talk to people, I try to socialize a bit because I'm the only one person on my shift, so I don't get to socialize with my coworkers at all, so I try to talk to the customers. Sometimes I talk to my boss when he's there. I play with our cats. Yeah, I'm trying to practice my latte art. Currently, I'm trying to learn how to make a rosetta. I can, I can make a tulip and a heart. um but yeah, rosetta is still very challenging. um or sometimes i bake. I bake carrot cake or brownie or, um 
banana bread but i don't really like it it's very time consuming um yeah what else oh also i i am labeling vinyls right now i'm just checking all the prices online i'm checking the quality of the vinyls and the sleeves and then i need to figure out what the price is which is actually interesting and I do the same with all of the CDs and then I put them in the system and I put some stickers on the vinyl, some CDs so then when people buy them they know what the price is So that's my job. That's what I do. No. I don't know. ",,,,,,,,
,Marysia,okay so um today im gonna give you my honest review on a book that ive read recently and um really liked actually. so it's it's called men without women and its written by one of my favourite writers ever em haruki marukami. and i really liked this book because its like a compilation of a bunch of um short stories all put together. and um it's really interesting because basically the stories show the perspective of men when they are dealing with women basically. so it just highlightes mens feelings when dealing with breakups or jealousy or just simply falling in love. and i really liked it honestly because basically its just a book about love and relationships and i could reate to some of the stories a lot. but also i feel like men's perspective is not often wrote about in books and since they never want to talk about their feelings well maybe some of them do but whatever. it was just very interesting and also very nicely written. with a lot of humour and overall i just enjoyed reading it. and also the format is really nice because the stories are quite short and um i could just read one at work or something and its not like i just stopped reading in the middle of the story. so yeah well thank you for listening and um i will talk to you some other time. bye.,,,,,,,,
,Josy,"So jujutsu kaisen, it's a very famous manga and anime show that you've probably heard about. But what is it about? So it follows, the main character called Itadori. And he goes to school and he's just doing the normal school stuff when all of a sudden he meets a guy in the hallway. But before that he runs an occult club with 2 of his friends. So them 3, they think there's something mysterious going on their school, so they run-in a cult club to try to figure this out. However, the story kind of starts because it's a comedy slash action slash horror, and it starts out with him with his PE teacher saying no you cannot join the occult club because you're so fast and so strong you have to join the fitness club. And then Itadori says but what if I throw this shot put like 50 meters? Can I then join the occult club? And the teacher says of course because no one can do it. So it starts with Itadori showing this massive strength and throwing it 50 meters. Then after one day after the occult club, Itadori meets Megumi, another one of the main characters in the hallway. Megumi is a sorcerer, a jujutsu sorcerer, and he fights demons. Megumi saves Itadori from a demon. So Itadori is like wow this is really interesting because Itadori is very much the type of person main character. He's very naive. He likes to get into everyone's business. He likes action. He's sporty. He always wants to be part of everything. So he gets involved and he fights this demon. However, they when they fought fight this demon, the demon, he he uncovers a finger which sounds a bit weird. It's a it's a dead finger and for some reason, Itadori has an urge to eat it and he does. And when he eats this, he turns into a demon, which is the strongest demon to have ever existed, our strongest curse to have ever existed called Sukuna and he turns into him and he has to fight Megumi. Then the strongest sorcerer, Jisoo sorcerer comes and saves a day Gojo who has an ability called unlimited, which means the closer you get to his body, the more your hand slows down to infinity so that you can never actually touch him, which of course is a really crazy ability to have. He is also very pretty and which makes him another reason why he's a main character as he has very blue eyes which is shown in the manga and anime a lot. Overall, he fights Sukuna and manages to take make him turn back into Itadori. The rest of the, series then goes on about how Itadori, because he's taken in this, finger, he now is able to see curses. So he trains to become a sorcerer to help fight these curses. And usually a person, if they eat one of Sukuna's fingers, they just die or they can't digest overall. But he could, showing how strong he is. So now his job is to eat all the fingers of Sukuna so that all his power is taken into Itadori's body and then he must die. So that Sukuna is finally killed off because he's such a horror to the world and keeps on creating messes. At some point however, another curse or really evil jujitsu sorcerer comes back alive and creates a plot to kill all humanity which of course throws everything off course, throws off the plan to fight Sukuna and everything just turns into a mess. There's also so there's 3 main characters Itadori, Megumi, and Nagura who are 3 of the students, at the jujutsu Sorcerer Academy in Japan. The whole story is in Japan.",,,,,,,,
,Josy,"So Harry Potter, what is it? So it's a massive movie franchise which is based on a book series by JK Rowling. So in this universe it is set in the in the world as we know it on earth in an urban setting. And it's the same as as we know it except there are magical folk called wizards and witches who can do curses and spells. So yeah, as you know a witch, that's them. It follows the main person called Harry Potter, who is he's born a wizard but he doesn't know it. So his parents die when he's very young and he's raised by his aunt and uncle who hate wizards because his aunt and uncle are from his mom's side. The mom was born to to muggles which is the term in the books and movies for non wizarding people. She was born to to muggles which does happen. It's not as common though. And her sister was always very jealous of this because obviously because of that she got a lot more attention than she did. So when Harry Potter's parents died he went to live with the Dursleys, his aunt and uncle, and they never told him that he was a wizard. He was also treated very badly. He had to live in a cupboard under the stairs. But when he turned 11 he got a letter from Hogwarts, which is the wizarding school in the UK, that he can go there, which was a very new thing to Harry. He was very excited. Anyways throughout the movie and book franchises it takes you on the adventures of Harry Potter. His arch and nemesis Voldemort, which has been the evil person for many years. He was the one who killed his parents. His parents were warring against him too. And what he puts Harry under, like mental conflict. He makes two friends. Hermione Granger who she's also both her parents are also non wizarding folkmuggles and Ronald Weasley who his parents are all wizards for a very long time. They're all redheads. Very large family is like six 6 siblings. And then 3, they're quite a trio. They're very fun to follow. The first couple are definitely made for children as the main characters are also children in the movie. There are 11 So there's 7 books and movies which follow the children through their 7 years in school until they graduate. So as the movies, the later on the movies, the more intense the movies get, the more violent there is and I think it's less focused towards children. However it's overall still a very interesting storyline whether you are an adult or child. For example, in the first book what happens is Harry gets to the school and there's a plot to steal the philosopher's stone which is a stone that makes you immortal. So him, Hermione and Ron, which are his 2 best friends, have to solve who is even doing it and how to stop him. In the second movie it's about the chamber of secrets which is a chamber hidden underneath Hogwarts. That's no no one knows where it is and that's been opened. And in this chamber is a massive snake that kills people. And the 3rd movie is about werewolves. So a new professor gets there and he's actually a werewolf. So it's kind of about that. I don't want to spoil too much. In the 4th movie, it's about the tri wizard cup. So there's there's, a competition between 3 schools and 3 people compete in there, three of the students, usually you'd have to be 17. And there's you can't get in unless you're 17 but somehow Harry who's 14 at the time his name gets drawn. And yes it completes some very very cool challenges. The 5th book is actually about a teacher who comes from a ministry of magic who's a bit of an evil teacher. And the ministry of magic thinks the ministry of magic is like the government, so it rules the wizards. They think that Dumbledore who's the headmaster also a very prominent figure in the books and movies is not a good headmaster anymore and because all the witches and wizards from the UK go to the school he has to be very good because they're the new generation. So he's a very important figure. So they sent him a person from the Ministry of Magic to, yeah make sure that what he's doing is okay and that's just to control him. But through doing this, she turns the school into a horrible mess and everyone hates her. I won't tell you about the other books to come, but overall, it's a movie to check out.",,,,,,,,
