friends with people for too long because of how they might see me they might know my flaws how I might need to open up for me I never even realized that cuz I'm always like I want to be friends with people long term and it's still true but maybe subconsciously I'm scared of them seeing my flaws my therapist was saying how like long-term friendships usually there is something that you don't like about the other person it is probably not like a big thing they're not exactly a clone of yourself there's going to be some differences because of that that makes a friendship very valuable despite the flaws you still love them of course like you know there are certain deal Breakers and that's for you to decide okay okay girlies so girlies what did we think of the Vlog via how are you feeling right now very good question I'm very happy you asked it is currently Thursday June 6th 9:33 p.m. I actually just came back from a solo walk so it was nice to take myself on a little walk I haven't done that in a while and I forget how nice that is and I am feeling better now I am feeling more motivated now I just have to force myself to do it to be okay doing it and I think like maybe I just ate something wrong in the past 2 weeks something happened and I just I just spiral I'm just like oh my God everything's going to suck again like I said before at the very beginning of the video the goal of these videos when I make them is to prove to myself emotions are like this okay there's the lows and there's the highs and yeah and I just need to keep telling myself that things are temporary and honestly these days I think I've gotten better at navigating these awful well actually you know what no because when the emotions suck at that moment it really sucks like it just feels like you can never get out of it but I hope to really just get to the point where it's like like even if I'm at an alltime low I can tell myself that hey hey this is just temporary you're going to get up there again you're going to feel better just because it's bad doesn't mean it's not going to be good like you just got to give it like you know a week or two and here I am and of course during a week or two you need to try at least getting yourself out there if any of you guys are going through something similar like I am um I hope that video helps you everything's temporary okay everything is especially your emotions like you're feeling very bad it's going to get better but you have to also put in the actions of trying to make yourself feel better I'm generally grateful that um I felt better today and I'm happy I'm back into making like these little little tiny Boston Vlogs because I kind of miss doing those and I feel you guys miss it too just be in the comfort of my own home,well-being
" You are not a machine. You are more like a garden. You need different things on different days. A little sun today, a little less water tomorrow. You have a fallow and fruitful season. It is not a design flaw. It is wiser than perpetual stainless. What does your garden need today? Everything could be going well lately. Maybe you have been consistent with your goals. You have been doing all in school or you have been keeping up with the fitness. But one morning, afternoon or evening, that feeling inevitably comes again. Or maybe there was something that reminded you of a bad past event and brought up old feelings of sadness and anxiety. Sometimes it even feels like whenever you feel genuinely happy, something bad is bound to happen. Maybe something occurred that didn't go how you think it would or didn't go as planned. In your job, relationships or school, and it seems like all the progress you've made has dissipated or doesn't have any meaning. Your logical brain knows it's not true. But no matter what, the emotions can take over and lead you in a very dark place. And I think here we go again. Honestly, this happened to me recently and I know I'm not the only one who goes through this. But I'm not going to let myself be sucked into a dark hole. So I picked up my camera so you can join me on a few days of trying to feel better. I'm not going to let myself be sucked into a dark hole. But I'm not going to let myself be sucked into a dark hole. I have a spoon inside my head. Life can be tumultuous, excited, confused, or disorderly. However, calm and stable someone's life appears, a closer look will reveal up and down. They're all part of the human experience. I like to sometimes imagine the ups and downs of life like a heartbeat. If it was a straight line, then our life would be over, like one on a heart monitor. I've accepted the inevitability of this, but thinking about the downs when you're on the peak really takes away from the moment of happiness. I struggle a lot with thinking about the what-ifs, so much that it spoils the very happiness in front of me. I just finished with practice and was kind of sad because it was the last practice of time. At the same time, since I've been aware of this phenomenon, I can use it to my advantage and see it the other way around to motivate myself through a challenging period. At a low point, I know that there will be an up sooner or later, and it's inevitable too. I've come over a bit, I love it, it's so easy. I can't do it, come on, I'm gonna have to see you start now. Take me home. Go down the road when you feel so indigenous. 1. Find things to look forward to. Sometimes when I enter a dark place, it seems like the future can be really hopeless. Events out of your control like the impossible cost of living or environmental concerns can bring me down a lot. The accomplishments that I do have seem so meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Therefore, I try to look closer, at smaller, even more superficial things to get through my life day by day. Every Sunday, a new episode of my favorite show releases. And recently, I've been looking forward to journaling every night to release my creativity and my thoughts. Some other things could be sports games or something small you're saving up to buy. I know people say to live life in the present, and that works sometimes, but during particularly stressful moments in time, it can be more beneficial to have something to look forward to. This is Amlant's Atherapist, Lanaya Smith Crawford. I'm sorry I just cried. I'm going to make my bed. I'm always telling myself I'm a boring person and I don't like spontaneity. I like routine and order and being comfortable, but sometimes I think that's just something I've been telling myself to avoid going out of my comfort zone. I've had myself going day after day doing the same things and of course that's going to be boring after a while. It feels like I'm just going through the motions of everyday life, but not truly living. So this time, I threw out the planner and I decided to take a spontaneous trip just to my best friend in different city and also visit my parents because I haven't seen them in months. The excitement and spontaneity was so refreshing because it was rare that I didn't plan in advance. I felt more relaxed, more flexible and doing different things made me feel like I wasn't missing out on moments of joy for once. And I'm not the only one who feels this way. 72% of people said they feel happier after they act spontaneously in some way according to a study conducted by one poll. So maybe it's time to veto the schedule for once. So I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not the only one who feels this way.",well-being
one of the biggest paradigm shifts that I have made about happiness is that it's not something that we feel it's actually something that we do it's a skill a muscle that all of us can strengthen and improve and to help you do that I've created this really simple five-minute happier workout that you can do wherever you are without having to change your life go away to meditate for a year having to you know cleanse your soul or organize everything perfectly you can do it right now in fact along with me so here are the five steps the first practice is acceptance and it's the practice of being with your feeling and with yourself just how you are not having to change negative into positive not having to shift or struggle but just how you are and to do it you simply spend two minutes being still and silent if you're comfortable please close your eyes but you don't have to we don't spend a lot of time in our life just being still and being quiet and so two minutes of stillness and silence is a great way to help you connect a little bit closer to how my feeling it's kind of like your chicken and then to practice just being there accepting of how you feel the second practice is gratitude now an overwhelming amount of research studies showed that when we practice gratitude our brains release dopamine and serotonin both of which make us feel really really good and the more regularly we practice the easier it is for our brain to do this on its own so when you practice gratitude as part of your happier workout I ask that you do two things first is you have to capture your gratitude in some way so maybe jot down on a piece of paper one or two things that you really appreciate about your life you can also say it to someone else you can share with another person something you're grateful for but you have to capture them the second piece is the more specific you can be about what you appreciate the better so think less I'm really grateful that I'm alive and more I'm really grateful that this morning I got to enjoy my favorite cup of coffee undisturbed for a couple minutes the third practice is what I call intentional kindness now we all know that it feels really really good to do something nice towards other people but in this practice you're actually focusing on your intention you're doing something by focusing all your intention I'm just doing something kind now to do something right now maybe it's something that is really simple you send a text to a friend and you check in and see how you're they're doing it's amazing what a tiny act of kindness like that can do to the recipient you know we live in these lives we're really busy we're running around it feels really good for someone to check in on us it feels really good to be seen if you can't do something kind right now as part of your happier workout put it on your calendar to do later it might seem strange to schedule kindness but I actually think it's really important we schedule meetings we schedule errands why not schedule kindness so as you're a third step and you're happier work out either do something intentionally kind or schedule it for later today your fourth practice of your happier workout is call it what I call the bigger why and the bigger why is connecting to a sense of meaning in our lives now often we think of meaning as something you know out there like we have to go out and find our life purpose but what I found is the best place to look for meaning is within our lives so what I'd like you to do is think about some of the things on your to-do list it could be something you're doing for work or something you're doing for your family or for a friend and now consider how that one task helps someone other than yourself you know maybe your project at work is helping your colleagues or customers maybe one of your errands today is to get groceries and the way it's helping your families that you're gonna make a nice dinner with it later when we connect to a sense of meaning we not only feel happier but research shows it actually makes it easier for us to get through the money to do this on our list the fifth practice in your happier workout is self-care now many of us have challenges with practicing self-care and self compassion because we feel like we don't have enough time or we feel like if we beat ourselves up or if we talk to ourselves harshly somehow we'll be more motivated to do better and to improve and in fact research has found the opposite research has found that when we treat ourselves with kindness and compassion with the same kindness and compassion that we usually reserved for people we love we're actually more likely to get things done or more likely to improve we're more motivated to do all of the things that we want to do so it's part of your happier workouts spend a minute saying a couple of supportive things to yourself it could be something as simple as hey I know you're gonna have a rough day today I'm just reminding you that you're okay and we'll get through it or it can be something where you express gratitude to yourself for yourself find something that you appreciate about yourself and say it to yourself as part of the self-care practice of your workout and finally when you're done with your five steps of acceptance gratitude intentional kindness the bigger why and self-care take a moment to just thank yourself for taking these five minutes out of your busy day to do something that is not just scientifically proven to improve your well-being but also will contribute to your productivity your creativity research has shown happier people have better relationships at both at work and at home and also consider the fact that by cultivating these practices through the simple workout in yourself you're helping people in your life experience some of that happiness as well because research shows that happiness is contagious so when you do this happier workout it doesn't just cultivate your own happier skills but it can be the beginning it can be the star at the inspiration for people in your life to cultivate theirs [Music] you ,well-being
happiness is an emotional response to an outcome if i win i will be happy if i don't i won't it's an if then cause and effect quid pro quo standard that we cannot sustain because we immediately raise it every time we attain it see happiness happiness demands a certain outcome it is result reliant and i say if happiness is what you're after then you're going to be let down frequently and you're going to be unhappy much of your time joy though joy is a different thing it's something else joy is not a choice it's not a response to some result it's a constant joy is the feeling that we have from doing what we are fashioned to do no matter the outcome now personally as an actor i started enjoying my work and literally being more happy when i stopped trying to make the daily labor a means to a certain end for example i need this film to be a boxed office success i need my performance to be acknowledged i need the respect of my peers all those are reasonable aspirations but the truth is as soon as the work the daily making of the movie the doing of the deed became the reward in itself for me i got more box office more accolades and respect than i ever had before see joy is always in process it's under construction it is in constant approach alive and well in the doing of what we're fasting to do and enjoying it define success for yourself you already like that one define success for yourself now check this out i'm in uh south of new orleans uh a few years ago and i went to a voodoo shop uh and they had this this this wooden partition against the wall these columns and in these columns were all these vials of these magic potions right and the headings above each potion defining what they would give you were things like fertility health family legal health energy forgiveness money guess which column was empty monet let's admit it money is king today it's what make the world makes the world go round it is success the more we have the more successful we are right we so often focus on failure don't we we study failure obsess failure we dissect failure and our failures dissect them so much we end up intoxicated with them to the point of disillusion and when do we write in our diary usually when we're depressed what do we gossip about other people's flaws and limitations we can dissect ourselves into self-loathing if we're not careful i find that most of the times our obsession with what is wrong just ends up breeding more wrong more failure the easiest way to dissect success [Music] is through gratitude giving thanks for that which we do have for what is working appreciating the simple things we sometimes take for granted we give thanks for these things and that gratitude reciprocates creating more to be thankful for it's really simple and it works now i'm not saying be in denial of your failures no we can learn from them too but only if we look at them constructively as a means to reveal what we are good at what we can get better at what we do succeed at now personally i've read a whole lot of my bad reviews all right i've had quite a few written by the more talented critics they are the ones who give constructive bad reviews they reveal to me what did translate in my work what came across what was seen or what wasn't now i don't obsess on the unfavorable aspect of their youth review but i do see what i can learn from it because their displeasure actually uncovers and makes more apparent what i do do well what i am successful at and then i dissect fact all right life's a verb we try our best we don't always do our best [Music] ,well-being
how to be happy right now now you have to really be in the Mojo for this so if you're not in the mood save this for later or ditch a video but if you if you believe that these seven tips will work they will so here they are seven tips for happiness and by the way I'm not the happiest guy in the world I get crabby doubtful Etc but here are seven things that um I'll pass along and you can use them at your own discretion first of all you are happy see people don't believe that but everybody's happy and uh everybody's got sort of a you know unhappy thoughts or um self-doubt or whatever that's not you that's something else so separate from it observe your negative thoughts as an outsider and uh you know focus on the happy stuff um second ditch the Debbie Downer and I mean your own internal Debbie Downer because everybody's got one they're like looking at negative things they're thinking negative thoughts they repeat them over and over and over again uh we all do that so uh don't push Debbie down out because she'll hold on tighter if you try that just release her like helium balloons in the air bye Debby uh number three garbage in garbage out you know you live what you pay attention to so if you're like reading bad news and watching dramas about serial killers chances are you're going to be down so I like surrounding myself with positive stimuli watching funny videos hanging out with positive people um garbage in garbage out good stuff in good stuff out then it sort of bakes in your subconscious and uh you'll be happier uh let's see number three make some make room for some um good habits and this is tough for me everybody falls off exercise for a while and starts to look at it like an obligation instead of something fun so find something fun whether it's meditation or walking in the woods or uh exercise or go see a psychiatrist uh I've got a good one uh sidewalk Psych iatrist I'll put the link in the uh description and uh just you know soak it up and enjoy it um and uh allow yourself some space for uh a good good you know good habits opposed to the bad ones like scrunching over and doing too much work or getting all bogged up and worried okay number uh five uh go see a life-changing movie or read a really good book I find that's the quickest way if you're in a funk if you can't take a nap uh go see a good movie or dig up one of those old do you have like a movie that inspired you go watch it again and comment below on a movie that you uh touched you and you know change your perspective for a while um maybe somebody else will find some value out of that um or get a good book you know I'm always reading these self-help books um and uh none of them are the magic you know cure all but I figure the more I read the more I'll get the better I'll get at this stuff uh number six I know like I know like I know I used to um have a job where I would like uh go to it every day this is like 10 years ago and I would like sing this song oh I hate my job I really hate my job and I would like hum this song that made me miserable so my new thing is uh it's from the secret um it's this woman on there that says you got to know like you know like you know so I just keep on when I'm thinking about my own goals I just keep saying I know like I know like I know they're here they're here already I'm there already um you know fake it to you make it uh and that's okay faking it to you make it you know like believing you already have what you're after um and tricking yourself into that because then you start doing the behaviors and like if you think you can't make it you you won't probably won't your odds are better if you believe you know you can accomplish it as long as you're not being delusional you know doesn't work for flying of TR I can't fly and I've accepted that limitation um finally jot down three at the end of each day jot down three things you'll find them three things that made you happy and uh if you do this for a week you have 21 of them and uh hopefully they're different and then you go back and look at those because you kind of get what you measure you know if you're paying attention to your debt you're going to get more debt if you pay attention to your fat you're going to get more fat but if you pay attention to what made you happy that day maybe give a little bit more the next day or at least notice that more so there we go what advice do you have share it below I want to hear it be happy you're happy yes you are yes you're very happy ,well-being

"Hi there, i'm Laura from Twinkl. You can use this music for well-being activity  with your class or even at home. Listening to music can have very powerful  psychological effects for your well-being. It can help calm the mind, energize the body  and even help to reduce stress. To begin sit down together and listen to a piece of music.  It could be someone's favorite song or a new piece of music you have not heard before. This  might be a good opportunity to expose children to a genre they might feel less familiar with.  As you listen encourage everyone to think about what they imagine whilst hearing the music  it might help for listeners to close their eyes at this point in time.Once the piece of music has ended ask each person to complete one of the sheets  it's a good idea to wait until the end of the piece to begin writing or drawing  as thoughts might change as the music continues. Sheet 1 asks you to draw a picture to illustrate  what you imagine then write about how the music makes you feel. Whereas sheet2 also asks you  to give a reason for your answer and rate the piece of music giving a reason for your score.  Everyone can choose which sheet they would rather complete or they can do both however sheet one may  be more accessible for younger children as they can draw their ideas and give a simple  description. Once everyone has completed their work take it in turns to share your  ideas with each other. Did anyone have any similar thoughts or were they very different enjoy taking  part in this discussion and encourage children to use musical vocabulary. If you need some  support with this check out our elements of music explainer which goes over some musical terminology  in more detail. Feel free to repeat the activity again and again, perhaps choosing a different  style or genre of music each time. Well that's all from me today, i really hope that you and  your children enjoy listening and sharing music together. Until next time! Bye for now!",well-being
hey besties I just feel like chatting today is that cool can we just have a little chat best see the besties you could probably tell by my lack of posting that I have not been doing well this is nothing new I've been through this before with you and explained why it's usually because I go through a depressive episode um and I feel like I had a chat about this not too long ago too like a couple months ago because I just didn't post for like a few weeks and then I posted a video I was like Hey I was not been doing well so yeah that's right and we're back at it again and I literally just like hate doing this not for the fact that I have to do it because I don't I get really supportive comments all the time and like you guys are so so nice and just so supportive but you know every once in a while I'll get a comment it's like girl you always do this like you always just like disappear or you always just not post and it's like yeah I know it's it's eating me alive I know but the thing is I post about my life and when you're not really living life or not really feeling like living life it's kind of hard to post anything and I want to talk about just outside the context of posting because this is not an explanation but it's not an excuse video I literally just want to talk about what I've just been struggling with uh because again I like to post about my life and I just want someone else who may be experience experiencing this to feel less alone because I feel so alone right now so yeah again it goes without saying that I pretty much have just not been feeling great mentally a main factor of it is that the frequency where I'm having the depressive episodes just keeps getting greater and it just feels like every other month now I'm just like in a month-long depressive episode and it's not a fun way to live and I feel like I'm always like oh that last one was bad and then another one comes along and it's literally worse because I feel like it's again just like built up emotions of just being frustrated that I have to go through this again so it's like the actual depression on top of just anger and frustration and I've just I've literally been doing and feeling nothing for the past couple weeks and like emotionally again you react to that so the fact that I'm not doing anything and not feeling anything or feeling terrible just again makes me more upset and angry so that's just this continuous loop of negative emotions and it's just not great I feel like I'm gonna ramble a lot I hope anything I say just like makes sense okay me so you go down there but yeah to describe my life currently it's kind of just nothing I I've been struggling most with just feeling absolutely no passion or spark for anything in life which is not fun and no matter how hard I try to force myself to get up and just do something just just do anything every day my brain is screaming at me just go do something something doesn't matter what it is I just I can't I cannot get my body up I cannot get my brain to cooperate I no matter how much I'm screaming internally get up do something go live I can't and you know the longer that goes on the harder it is it gets to like do something and it just makes me even more sad on top of my sadness because I'm sad that I just feel like I'm wasting my life no matter how hard I'm trying to not do that but it makes it so difficult because I know subconsciously that anytime I do start something or I try to implement something new or have a good time it's just gonna be followed up by another depressive episode like it's hard not to recognize the patterns even though I don't want to believe them I want to believe that there's you know a chance that it'll never happen again it most likely will I know it's like fall down seven times get up eight but what about if you've fallen down like a thousand times you get pretty [ __ ] tired and you don't want to ride the bike anymore but I mean I keep trying and that's what everyone just asked me just like oh keep keep pushing through keep going I really have to keep going tattooed on me and it's like I am and I will I'm just [ __ ] tired I'm tired of feeling like a prisoner to my own brain and body and I currently just feel like like I said I just have no passion or spark for anything because I'm so tired and burnt out and it just feels like every day I don't know what I'm like getting up for and I don't want to feel that way like that's a scary thought to me I don't want to feel that way I want to wake up and want to live my life because we literally only get one of them and I want to make the most of everything and I've had time periods where that's happened so I know I'm capable of it so it makes it even more frustrating to know that I am capable I just for some reason cannot do it right now like there's only been like maybe two solid periods of my life where I felt like I was literally like cured of my depression and then of course it came back both times and that just makes it very discouraging and I remember that person I'm like that just feels like completely different that doesn't feel like me that feels like an alternate reality where that just wasn't me like how do I get back to that person so again I just have this like lost sense of identity I don't know who I am I don't know what I'm doing I don't know what I'm getting up for I don't know I don't know anything I don't know anything I don't know how to move forward because every time I move forward I fall back again one step forward two steps back like it's every time I just I never want this to come off as just like complaining and excuses and yeah whatever poor pity reads like I never want to do that I I'm I'm fighting hard every day I'm allowed to be tired and allowed to be exhausted and that's something I try to tell myself even though I hate it you know I I just as much beat myself up for it that I'm going through this but I try to have some sort of compassion for myself that's like a lot of this is out of my control and I'm doing as much as I possibly can to control it so again I never want this to come off as just like a pity party I'm just explaining how I'm feeling you know and I also always feel a lot of like shame and embarrassment around kind of the privilege of being allowed to be depressed because I do work from home and this is my job but I also want to explain like if I don't post I'm not making money like it is directly affecting my income thankfully I'm kind of good with my money so I do have some saved up but I'm not rich by any means like I'm gonna need to work I need to post and I want to post more than anything like again it's never a need like YouTube and stuff is at least was my passion and it still is I'm still trying to like get back to it and find it I'm not like Rich by any means or like sitting on a pile of money where I can just do nothing all day like I still need to pay my bills and stuff and every day my bank account is dwindling that's just like another stress that's on me because I just I just always feel anytime I'm talking about being depressed and not doing anything where again I'm literally not doing anything not posting even though it's my job I don't want it to think it's some privilege to take where I'm just like an influencer that can do whatever they want and just making lots of money and doesn't care about her audience or her content that's not it at all I want the spark back for this so bad every day I'm like man I want to film a video but I'm not even getting up and doing anything or living my life so there's nothing to film plus I'm and just depressed and I have no self-confidence or esteem and I don't obviously want to like get on camera and post when I'm in a bad mood because that would be terrible content you know I I like to post uplifting stuff so yeah it's it's not like that at all and that's why I make these type of videos where I'm kind of like explaining because I'm just I'm just human struggling that just happens to make YouTube videos I would still be experiencing this whether or not this was my job that was kind of a different rant I don't I I hope that's taken well I it's just everything I say I hope it's again taken well and just a conversation between us I don't know I get kind of nervous because these are very nuanced topics um you know that feeling in your chest when you can't take a deep breath all the way in like if you've been like swimming all day or in the ocean and you've just been holding your breath all day so like by the end of the day you can't like take a deep breath I just I feel like that all the time I can't take a deep breath I can't relax I just feel frustrated just the main word I can ever come up with is frustrated frustrated with myself for not being able to do enough to fix this frustrated that I'm doing so much and none of it's working frustrated that I have to deal with this in the first place frustrated that there's people that have it way worse than me and I'm complaining just frustrated all around about everything um but again I try to be nice to myself I try to be compassionate it's hard though when I just constantly feel like I'm failing myself and just wasting my life and not living up to any of my expectations just constantly disappointing myself because that's another thing [ __ ] I don't want to cry that's another thing with the whole content creation thing I want I have have one of this and want this so bad I'm so inspired by other creators and I'm just like I want to live that life and I know I could do it I know I could like put out content every day and like I know I'm good at doing this it's just this [ __ ] depression and mental illness gets in the way every time and I'm like if I was not this mentally ill I would be able to live out my passion and really make it work for me and really just I don't want riches or fame I just want to be able to do what I love which is like making videos and pictures and talking about things I care about and feeling again like I'm living life and just every day I don't make content and I'm not following my passion and what I want I just I'm so disappointed in myself I'm so disappointed and again this would apply to any anything I was doing no matter what my career was or my passion was like it would apply to anything I just I can't get myself to do anything I feel completely out of control of my body and my emotions and my brain I don't really know what else to say I didn't really don't cry it has been really really tough for me recently and I hate it and again the hate adds on to the continuous cycle of bad feelings so I'm trying not to but it's hard when I just constantly feel like my life is put on hold and I'm just wasting it so sorry for this depressing ass conversation unfortunately that's just how it would be right now and there's really no outtake or something I can end this positively on I don't know I would like to end it positively like I am trying I'm really I'm really trying I just recently went to the psychiatrist and I'm trying out a new medication so we'll see if that works um I was told I have treatment resistant depression so that's really fun so again I'm telling you guys I've literally tried every single category of antidepressants I've tried this will be my fifth one in my lifetime and they all have stopped working and it's literally just treatment resistance so I'm like oh my God like no matter how hard I try it's just not gonna work it's always relieving to get a diagnosis but it's also like what the [ __ ] do I do with this now uh what do I do with this information treatment resistant but whenever I'm trying a new medication so we'll see if it does any anything different yeah I don't know I'm open to literally trying anything but I don't I don't really know how to end this it's so this conversation is so depressing and I hate feeling like I'm complaining but uh I'm just gonna say thank you if you've watched this at all especially to the end because I know people don't really like to watch talking videos I don't I don't have the attention span for that thank you if you watch any of my videos ever and have ever supported me or ever left a nice comment or a like on a video like that is what I live for unfortunately my brain is just disconnected from that right now and I'm trying to get back into it anytime I get support from anyone every single view every single comment I read I look at and it just it's just a really great feeling um and that's all thanks to you guys so I'm trying I'm trying to come back we'll see what happens so yeah okay bye,well-being
i didn't plan to take my own life but i think it was fortunate that day i decided to take that route stop the car in the field and break down if that didn't happen i'd potentially wouldn't be here speaking to you [Music] hello how are you things got tough a few years ago i was leading a project that kept hitting barriers the team was not collaborating communication is broken down i felt constantly under attack those 40 miles home felt like my only chance to shake it off then the cracks widened and started reaching into my personal life i found myself in the midst of a separation i couldn't see my children regularly my closest friend for 30 years i received the news that he died from cancer it it felt like a gut punch i i couldn't catch my breath for days and i withdrew in a professional environment i was fine i was talking normally smiley and everything else as soon as i shut that door and i came back into my car at home i was a different animal i didn't talk about it it was a cold night in early spring and and i remember it so clearly my mind was racing i couldn't sleep i got in the car the next morning things were spiraling in my brain constantly this was just mounting and mounting and mounting it felt like a ticking bomb inside me and i literally swerved across the road parked the car in the field and i i cried i was it i completely broke down i just needed to let let loose i just needed this to come out i felt felt like a failure sorry so it was tough at that point in time this is when i understood i need help my decision to reach out that day changed everything a colleague from work listened he saw me and guided me to was a gp i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety they say that recognizing you need help is the biggest step but realizing that i was not alone and reaching out that's what saved me i spoke to my family my friends i started understanding and explaining that this was a medical condition and i began to see her way through i dug really deep questioning ideas i believe since my childhood what it means to be a man a modern man and that it's okay to be vulnerable and for life not to be exactly how i expected it two years on now i know i can't erase my past but it is the past and i can leave it there and today is about finding my happy right here right now and i am happy i remember the surprise on my colleagues faces when they heard what i'd been through i started to realize that by opening up and being very honest about my story my situation some of them started opening up back to me and i was able to talk to people who understood how i was feeling who had gone through the same and in my experience it's not that people don't want to help it's just we don't recognize the signs so this is my story my lesson that there is strength in being raw and open and affected and even on darker days you're never alone so break the cycle pay attention reach out open up it's okay not to be okay,well-being
your happiness is not a destination happiness does not have to be big sometimes things are just simple life is short but at the same time it's very long you have to do something you enjoy as something is very short because you only live once happiness can be in seconds why can't I smile more I'm always like someday someday someday instead you should change your mindset into one day can you see me is the lighting bad why do I feel look so weird should fix my hair I can't tell anyways hi everyone welcome back to my channel yeah so exciting anyways anyways okay so for this video this is something that I need all of you guys to hear this is something that I think it's very very simple when you grow up in a certain environment you just don't seem to get it and that is just the fact that you can be happy every single day happiness can be achieved every single day you are allowed to be happy every single [Music] [Music] day [Music] [Music] you know what's really funny I only realized this recently like I fully understood the concept that I can be happy every single day just recently that's kind of messed up when you're a kid you have this sort of idea of Happiness as in this is a destination once I reach this destination I'm going to be happy but that's not true I went through it I was very focused on academics if I get into college that's going to be my happiness all my problems are going to be solved I can tell you right now no because once you get into college you are still living I did feel like when I got into college a lot of the stress I had was kind of gone but you're still going to have problems you might even realize a lot of the deeper problems that you might have not realized because you were so focused on your academics and for me that was like mental healthwise I wasn't really looking into some of the the traumatic um I didn't didn't really want to face it you know once one of the things your worries is gone there's something else to worry about based off of my 22 years of living all I can tell you is that your happiness is not a destination happiness does not have to be big if it is great but I think you have happy seconds at least to happy minutes happy minutes leads to happy hours happy hours leads to Happy Days Happy Days leads to happy months and happy months leads to healthy years okay that's my mentality you don't have to feel happy all the time don't feel like oh I'm not feeling happy now I'm wasting my life no I'm just saying that you are are allowed to feel happy I'm not allowed to feel happy I haven't reached my goal I can't I can't I can't feel happy happiness is not a grand thing you go out you take a walk ah the air is nice I love this temperature my favorite type of weather is Autumn hence I'm really happy right now chilly sunny weather in the low 60s like those are my favorite type of weather oh I want to try this new bakery store I'm going to go to this new bakery store I'm wearing my favorite shoes I'm wearing a pretty outfit I like my makeup today I like my hair today I'm starting a really good book oh I am so proud of myself for going to the gym today these are just some of the examples that make me happy and they're not especially Grand and they honestly they don't have to be being happy is very important because what's dominia like like then there's so much to see out in the world right sometimes things are just simple and I know like I can understand that in certain period of times in certain environment life can be really hard I had a phase where it's just in I was in a bad environment I was not in the right place I was with the bad people and it was it was hard to be happy personally for me Independence brings me happiness can mean all sorts of things I was like 18 16 you know I didn't realize how short and how long life is life is short but at the same time it's very long you have to do something you enjoy as something is very short because you only live once as a kid you listen to the adults you're like oh they want me to do the they want me to do that you need to make sure you like it I personally would like to believe that hard work pays off it may take a lot of time right your feelings may not always depend on external college application season or you're working a very stressful job and you have a big project coming up that doesn't mean that you can't feel happiness at that moment of course is stressful if something makes you happy embrace it the truth is you can be be happy every single day and the reason why that is possible is because happiness does not have to be something Grand you do not have to be promoted to CEO right you don't have to be a billionaire or a millionaire you don't need to be that to be happy okay oh I had a good hangout today or oh I tried a new ice cream flavor and I really liked it that's happiness there you did it you achieved happiness oh if there's bad moments then I don't achieve happiness no happiness can be in second you can have seconds of happiness every single day you can have I don't know a few minutes of happiness that's no happiness I think you need to notice more things sometimes just being more aware of your surroundings you go out you look into nature like ah the leaves are changing colors ah the sun is looking great sometimes life is simple sometimes life is complicated life can be really complicated we're all humans we're all very complicated we all have separate layers but sometimes I do believe that when things are simpler sometimes it's nice sometimes when your happiness is in simple terms I think it's great I feel happy when I see nature okay then you go out in nature and you feel happier I think happiness should be the journey because once you've reach the destination that can only last a brief moment right after that moment then what emotions are always temporary right bad emotions good emotions they're all temporary so when you reach your destination and you're happy that's temporary that's why it's very important for you to realize that your everyday life you can be happy cuz sometimes you know you wake up and you have a feeling of dread and you're like tomorrow's going to be here again I woke up this morning today is going to be awful but who said so why is today going to be awful why can't today be great why can't today be your day why can't every day be your day it's not self it's not selfish to want to be happy every day I realized these days I think that one of the key to happiness these days is for me to be a little more Shameless and you might be like what do you mean by that at least for me I don't really see a lot of people doing this like when they're just walking alone they're smiling for themselves and I'm like I should smile more why can't I smile more who the is going to punch me if I smile like the like I'm going to walk out the door I'm going to smile like I'm not talking to anyone on the phone I'm not listening to music but guess what I'm still going to smile because why in the can't I smile you can go out and you can smile because V said so V said you can smile so go smile go outside and smile like a idiot because who gives a you don't know if a nice compliment would really just change someone's life or changes someone's day right sometimes if I see like a girl wearing a pretty skirt I'll be oh I really like your skirt I don't need to compliment back it just makes me happy to compliment someone right it's just doing something nice you know you don't have to tell anyone about it but I think doing something nice daily can be a good thing and another thing that I think is important to know is that your happiness should not depend on other people I mean of course like you having friends and stuff is nice but sometimes you need to know that you can create own happiness just by yourself you can take yourself on a date you can take yourself to your favorite bakery store you can take yourself on a walk okay I enjoy having good company but I do realize that a lot of the time when I am by myself I take in moments better if I'm in like a quiet Garden I can just sit there because sometimes I just like standing in places and just taking it and I'll just be looking I oh that's really pretty I can just stand at for a very long time and I I do feel like making this video is sad in some ways I do feel bad for my younger self she genuinely just was going about life quickly as in she wants to get there as fast as possible as in the life that she was living at that time was not worth living which I think back to where I'm like okay she was in a very sucky place I just wish you could have enjoyed the journey a little bit and see things in a different perspective I'll be happy at the destination but sometimes you need to realize or something that I needed to realize back then was that I had a lot of mental issues there was a lot of internal conflict that needed to be fixed yes going into a different environment helped but not all the situations were solved because I didn't face myself I didn't face my internal issues I want to become something else I want to become X I'm jealous of this I'm jealous of that why are you jealous of that why aren't you working towards your goal what is stopping you from doing that that's why you feel so much you feel like oh I'm not happy right now because you're not working towards the things you want cuz I'm not taking the first step I'm always like someday someday someday instead you should change your mindset into one day this day I am going to do this I'm going to start this day instead of one day someday someday I'm going to do that someday if you keep saying that you're never going to do it the first step that you take it does not have to be perfect it can be taking the first step matters okay that is the hardest part the next hardest part is to keep taking the steps the steps that you take you can be it can be okay it can be really really bad but you don't fail if you keep going you do not fail you only fail if you give up going even when you suck ass is hard cuz think about it when you're going you can keep going but you're you're succeeding every single time you're going that's easy everyone can do that right because you're succeeding but when you go and keep going and you know at the at back of your head I'm like this might not go good but you still decide to okay you know what it's not going to go go but I'm still going to do it okay I'm going to learn something from this I have to keep going I have to suck it up and keep going you know every single time you're like I'm anxious as hell this is going to suck like oh my God I cannot do this every single time I being a disappointment to myself but you're still going and going you're going to reach it and I hope you reach it because you deserve it something that I think is very cliche that everyone says but back then I did not understand is that you deserve happiness and the reason I didn't really understand is because everyone says it you deserve happiness how do you know I deserve happiness you're a human being let's think of it like this why do you think that you don't deserve happiness I think as a human being we deserve happiness it shouldn't be conditional why do you want to live life suffering right life is short this might sound morbid to you guys but death is going to be coming for all of us someday our time on planet Earth is limited death will get us someday okay let that s into your brain nobody escapes time nobody does we're all going to die someday I'm sorry if this I burst your bubble so while we're at it why don't we enjoy life I think that's just part of Being Human you know we know we're all going to die so we're all going to to enjoy life you need to live life like it's your own because at the end it is your own life you're not living for someone else and sometimes it's hard to come to the conclusion of that especially for those of us who grew up you know you want to please your parents you want to please your relatives you want to please other people you want to please your friends right okay I pleased you I pleased you and then what like what the is going to happen I live the rest of my life trying to please you that's exhausting who the am I then why can't I live my life especially when adults expect you to act a certain way I'm like you don't deserve to have a kid I'm sorry you don't because if you expect your kid to act a certain way and you don't expect them to Chase your own dreams and be their own person you should not have been a parent your kid wants to achieve something else so you as the guardian as to parent whatever the you are you should allow that because that is your responsibility when you decide to have a child or you wanted to take on the responsibility of taking care of that child that is your number one responsibility you need to let your kid be themselves they have their own version of happiness that they want to achieve which might be different from yours right I personally love the boring life I get comments where people are like wow your life is so boring good I I'm a boring person and I like boring suit me I like finding happiness and mundane things I like finding Beauty in boring mundane I like things simple I like things slow that makes me happy that's me I like boring that might not be you it's fine it's okay we all like different things what I'm trying to get at is that everyone's definition of happiness is different but that doesn't mean that if your definition of happiness is different that is not happiness anymore it is still happiness so what I want you guys to get from this video is just the fact that I want you to be happy you know and sometimes it takes a long time to realize this and look at me took me 22 years to realize this type of that should be so simple right to understand if I was a kid and I watched this video hopefully I would change my mind and be like yeah I can be happy right now like a lot of times like happiness depends on a certain point of your life maybe you need to have certain things fulfilled right now me I'm a lot happier than I was back then but because I'm older I get access to a lot more things compared to when I was younger Maybe it could also just be to therapy or due to other external factors happiness is not easily achieved in some ways because sometimes the obstacles that's blocking us from happiness is internal and it takes time heal from it forgive to accept to move on it takes time and I'm not saying that it's going to be quick but I'm saying that you are allowed to be happy so yeah I really genely do hope that this video helps some of you guys I want life to be easier for you guys and I hope this message really speaks to some of you guys if a cup of ice cream makes you happy that's good that's good that's good when you realize tiny things can make you happy I think you can live a very happy life that's it for this week's video I hope that this video genuinely helps some of you guys because this is something that I only realized recently really wanted you guys see the same perspective as me because I feel like when I realize this I just feel like things are just so much more different for me I hope you guys all have a Lov lovely lovely rest of your week and I will see you guys all next week I love you guys guys and I will see you guys all very very soon,well-being
"I just got back from a trip to La I've been traveling a lot lately and while it's been fun I'm very happy to be home while I was there I met up with a new Creator friend Megan Tan in person for the first time ever it was such an adventure and I think we had an even better time than we thought we would today I want to talk about the one mindset shift that completely changed my 20s for the past several years I've had this personal motto that goes say yes now figure it out later I've talked about it once on here before and it is a motto that I hold very close to my heart and has been responsible for many events in my life it's my little tattoo on my wrist and I cannot believe it's already been 2 years since I got this thing that's crazy a lot has changed since then and I always find it very interesting to revisit themes at different phases in my life and see if it's still relevant if things have changed or if it's reinforced and for this in particular there have been a few things that have reminded me of it when I had first come up with the phrase figure it out later it was after I had dropped out of college and was slowly finding my way in the world I had an idea of what I wanted to do but I wasn't great at putting myself out there I cared way too much about what people thought I was way too in my head about some things and I struggled to really find my voice and throughout this time figur it out was my anchor it was a way of reminding myself to just make a decision and I will figure it out when I get there sort of having this trust in yourself while taking these leaps of faith and periodically it will pop in and out of my life I think we inherently know when we connect with the idea of something it feels exciting and terrifying all at once but before we even have the chance to pursue it we often hold ourselves back because we don't know how it will turn out when Megan asked me to go on a trip to the West Coast there was a moment where I felt hesitant to go it had been a while since I've done anything like that we had only just begun to know each other and I was considering saying no but you never know what an opportunity will lead to and you never know how impactful something will be till after you've done it there could be a million different things that could make it the wrong choice but you only need a few good reasons for it to be right when it comes to these giant leaps of Faith quitting your job taking the trip meeting someone for the first time it always leads back to this four-letter word risk beautiful outside there was a period of my life where I was feeling very stagnant I wasn't meeting new people or experiencing new things but I was also not putting myself out there at the same time it's so easy to be comfortable in your but I think it's also important not to take it too far and it's not about saying yes to everything but it's important to know when something will be a healthy push it can be intimidating to open yourself up to show the world who you are and not know how it's going to be received this place but we're never going to know what's on the other side unless we're willing to take that first step and see where that tells us where to go next the beauty of putting yourself out there is that it also forces you to be adapted and creative in ways you may have not expected C it opens you up to seeing things in a different way learning from different people and maybe even finding things you weren't even looking for there will always be some level of risk involved when it comes to doing something completely out of the ordinary from what we're used to but honestly I think that's just the name of the game and depending on what season of life we're in it's either going to be a yes or no and I think both and answers are valid it depends just where you're at in life and if it's a yes then sometimes it'll work and sometimes it won't but either way you'll learn something from [Music] it my creative Journey so far has been
[Music] there's a certain naive confidence you have when you just enter your 20s unlike any other part of your life it's the easiest to lose and the longest to get back and if there was one part of the era I could take to the next I think it probably would be that it is quite the claim that this is the mindset that helped me navigate my 20s out of everything else but looking back I can't imagine all the things I would have missed out on and all the things that led to another since then it is truly one of the few themes in my life that keep on reoccurring in between all the years and different context and routes and each time still holds this universal truth that it starts with what you think you can do but ends with finding [Music] out so I hope you enjoyed this video it was very fun to revisit a topic and see where I was at with it safe to say my trip to California with Megan was not a disaster in fact it was the complete opposite guess you got to see a little bit of the behind the scenes in this video but Megan made a beautiful video while we were on a trip in California so if you haven't seen that yet then please check it out as always thank you for watching you can find me on Instagram at leera in the meantime and I will see you in the next one bye",well-being
again I've always been envious of girls who are friends with each other you know girls who have lots of friends when you are alone you figure out a lot of things that you never really know about yourself when you're just completely alone with no friends I feel like there's a certain breakthrough that you probably never have am I worthy of having friends don't ever let having no friends to stop you from living your best life whoa hey that was a really bad intro anyways hi everyone welcome back to my channel so for this journal entry episode eight we're going to be talking about why having no friends is completely okay I'm kind of shocked that I haven't talked about because as you guys can see I do a lot of things by myself I've always had trouble keeping friends long term this can go into a lot of issues of mine and as a kid I've always been extremely insecure because I didn't have you know a lot of friends that I had like really low self-esteem ever since I was a kid I did everything by myself but it was always kind of like I had to I didn't really learn to enjoy doing things by myself as a kid I've always been envious of girls who are friends with each other you know girls who have lots of friends and I always wanted to be like that but as I gotten older I realized how having no friends is really okay it really is when you are alone you figure out a lot of things that you've never really known about yourself because sometimes when you're in group setting a lot of us tend to just like go with the flow you go with what your friends want I want to do this because I just want to enjoy their company which is completely fine but you don't realize what you want you like this activity because you guys are doing it together right you have your friends company you like their company so as you like this activity that doesn't mean you like this activity when you have no friends to hang out with all you have is yourself so you really try to do things that you enjoy right it's very obvious like you know we all want friends so it's very very normal to feel lonely because sometimes I feel like when we feel lonely it's like you feel bad about it you're like but you need to understand that is very very normal it is normal to feel lonely it is normal to want company from people and start pushing the thought away I tell myself that this is normal I'm a human being I shouldn't want to socialize with people friendships can also make you feel lonely just because you're in a group of people doesn't mean that you would feel included right somehow you're in a group of people feel like an outcast you just feel like oh my God like I feel like nobody here really gives two shits about me like I said I'm just here just to be here I just want the company of others even though I'm not really enjoying their company so would you rather be feeling lonely by yourself or feeling lonely in a group personally I would rather feel lonely by myself like what's the point hang out with people if you feel lonely when you're with friends you can become so fixated on them you can become so focused on them that you don't really care about what you want you don't care about the goals you have because some of us just want to hold on to that song want to hold on to these friends because you just feel you've been alone for so long what if they leave me what do they leave me for someone else whether I'm not good enough and I don't blame you because you know we all want friends sometimes you might even lose your passions and your goals you might set that aside it's like a thing that you don't even realize and that is not to say like this is a friend's fault it's our fault I'm not encouraging YouTube boyfriend when you're just completely alone with no friends I feel like there's a certain breakthrough that you probably never have I mean of course it gets dark sometimes but also it can be a breakthrough you realize how capable you are to do absolutely everything by yourself once you have this mindset even when you get back into friend groups you will still have this mindset I personally don't think it can be taken away once you have this breakthrough when you have no friends you realize that I have to do everything for myself sometimes these things is just like you have to just do it you have so much fear you're like oh my God I cannot do this I have to do this with someone else but you can literally sometimes we just overthink but the things that when we think so much about it it's a waste of energy it's literally a waste of energy to be anxious about a 24 7. just do it because trust me when you actually do the thing it's not as scary as you think I feel like sometimes when you just have no friends sometimes you try to prove yourself am I worthy of having friends and then you start doing things to make yourself feel I need to better myself feel I'm worthy for friends but the things that you are worth your friend you can create a better version of yourself but make sure that you're creating it for the right reason you're creating it for yourself that's a proof to anyone that you are worth your friends because you are I I had this negative mind this where I feel oh I don't deserve friends because I have mental issues friendship breaks down I blame it all myself I'm like oh this is my fault this is my fault I was the one who called it off I'm the one who who left for friendship to work there needs to be both parties right I sometimes need to remind myself that they also didn't do anything to fix the friendship I tell myself that just because I am mentally ill doesn't mean that I don't deserve friendships and this was something that I felt like almost as if I'm punishing myself but when I came to realize is that I am trying to better myself and I feel like that counts for something if you feel like oh my God I feel so alone I have no friends like I must be such a loser but the thing that you cannot force it just because you have friends doesn't mean that you're you're less worthy compared to other people who do and I'm also not saying that like oh we should look down on people who have friends because there are friendships that are extremely beautiful healthy healthy friendships you know supporting one another some of us just haven't found the right people and I want you guys to stay home cool really genuine so easy to just be like that's their fault steer for us for somebody it is but sometimes you realize maybe I'm the problem it speeds up your self-growth when you realize that there's a problem within you because we're human we all have problems don't shame yourself don't try to close yourself off just because all my friends down it doesn't mean that you're not gonna have friends in the future right there's a lot of people who are dealing with us especially if you're in your early 20s it's not talked about enough once you realize how capable you are when you are alone it's almost like a superpower in how your happiness can come from just within yourself you don't need anyone to complete you yes I can help it can make you happier but you can get all the happiness you want from within yourself you can spread happiness when you are happy if you are unhappy how the hell can you spread happiness [Music] I'm not saying that no you have to spread happiness to others it can make an interaction more joyful and you can realize how when you are happy you attract more people like I tend to get insecure and sometimes like I project I sometimes just think oh just because I'm insecure about so and so they probably think bad of me which is really toxic and it goes to show you this because I'm insecure but if I was happy if I was confident this interaction that happens with another person will be great I wouldn't be so self-conscious I I wouldn't think about it I want to think that because I'm confident I'm feeling good which is why I believe that you need to achieve your happiness foreign you can achieve all the happiness with yourself you want to go sit by the beach go sit by the beach and when you do these things that builds up your confidence and when you build up your confidence you realize how you can do almost everything by yourself I'm not saying that you're doing all of this to just you know attract people but you're becoming happier at the same time you're attracting people so it's like a win-win why not I'm not trying to be like oh you can do everything by yourself so you don't need other people I'm saying that don't close yourself off to people I want you guys to enjoy her alone time but when people come you can be the judge of that who you want to let in slowly get to know them don't get attached too fast don't build this image of them of food they're gonna be and don't feel like and so be it they're not right for you slowly get to know them and be patient they'll slowly show you who they are and then get to decide whether you want to continue pursuing the apprenticeship I feel like I have been more open to people that I have been able to meet a lot of good people good friends this year when I hang out with friends I like it's like I genuinely enjoy it like I genuinely go back home like I really enjoy that interaction which I'm really proud to say because like back then I sometimes go get home from interaction with like friends and it just it feels awful however I still at the same time enjoy my alone time as well because there's something different when you hang out by yourself it's also amazing when you can hang out with really good friends you need to make sure that you don't lose your sense of identity when you hang out with people I mean of course your identity can always change but just hold on what feels true to you hold on to yourself no matter who you hang out with it took me to lose the Friendship to understand who I was and I'm not saying like oh my God that friendship in order to figure out who I am when the friendship ended I realized how much things I wanted to do that I never realized I wanted to do before because I was just fixated on them ever since then I know what I want and I have goals I know what I like and I know what I don't like and this all happened because I was alone for so long [Music] do a lot of things by myself a lot what you guys can clearly tell from the content of this channel life can be very lonely something that makes it more bearable is just finding things that you like doing life is worth living with kind people and sometimes it can just take a little tiny thing to make your day really really great it's normal to feel lonely and feel like you have no one to talk to but don't let that stop you from living don't ever let having no friends to stop you from living your best life okay because you're life does not depend on others you have yourself and that is more than enough all you need to do is believe in yourself and when you realize how much you can achieve when you are alone you become Unstoppable and I'm not lying with that I'm really not the reason why you'll be unstoppable is because the things that you want to do no one can stop you the only person that can stop you is yourself so when you realize that I'm not gonna become my own obstacle and you go achieve that you can do it just because you have no friends doesn't mean that you can't achieve your dreams or whatever has certain issues that are preventing your own reading products that's why self-reflection is very important going to therapy journaling self growth important when you have these issues you you want to get better [Music] um that's the end of my journal entry episode eight why having your friends is completely okay I hope you guys enjoyed the journal entry I'm really happy to be able to talk about this I guess I wish someone had told me this maybe when I was younger um which is why I'm making this video trust me you'll find good people along the way but as of now better yourself and do what makes you happy okay okay anyways I will see you guys all very very soon I hope you guys will have a lovely rest of your morning afternoon or night okay okay bye,well-being
i have to know how my brain works um in order to catch it from doing bad things because the brain is really tricky and it will tell you things that aren't true and so knowing that i would remember a negative experience more than i'd remember a positive i would really make it my mission to go okay but the positive experiences with that person were equal i'm gonna choose to let that negative experience go [Music] it's hard to put into words honestly and it feels different at different times when my anxiety is high it feels like an absolute inability to make decisions like i would rather not do something then decide what to do and it's almost paralyzing which is odd because it seems like it's simple do you want to go on a walk or sit on the couch and watch tv and i'm like i can't figure that out my i don't have the brain power it feels like decision fatigue and then depression is different my version of it feels very restricted like um like if you're trying to put on like a latex glove that's way too small for your hand also it sort of coincides with this feeling of not being excited about anything which again on a day when you feel great or even normal you can get excited about things like you're like oh i'm gonna have pizza today or i'm gonna see a friend today or i mean all of the fun things about life and when i'm having depression it's like none of those things are exciting or seem worth it so there's this real disconnect because i know logically that should be a feeling that induces some happiness but it's like my depression will not let me recognize those feelings at 40 i don't like believe anything should be taboo anymore like i talked to my kids about sex and yes they're very young but they wanted to know how they got here and we talked about it and they were grossed out and left the room and that's fine but i think that anything that's taboo and hard to talk about should be some of the first priorities you should be talking about with the support systems in your life i wish that i had known as a person in the public eye to talk about it publicly at an earlier date i had been acting and you know doing publicity for a while and i was at the stretch the last stretch of of two movies of a press tour and i'd done all these interviews and i was lying in bed about to do sam jones which is a long-form interview like it's like a 45 minute to an hour sit down so you better be prepared to talk right and i said to my husband god i have nothing to talk about i feel exhausted like i've said every story about my life and he said why don't you talk about your struggle with anxiety and depression and it like was a huge light bulb i was like have i never i've never done that i was experiencing the same thing that everyone else was which is like well just don't talk about that and then i just felt so inauthentic and irresponsible to have been presenting this like bubbly happy person which is someone that i cultivate and i nurture and i try really hard to exist as um and i just wasn't being honest with the people like the girls who may look up to me and so i was like okay i'm just gonna talk about it and so i don't even think that sam knew but during that interview i was like actually you know for a period of my life and periods and often and sometimes just on a random wednesday i feel this way and then we started to get more in depth and i found myself really happy to be admitting all of it and the response i got from that interview was like astounding to me like so many people saying i've felt that way too thank you for saying it out loud you gave me the courage to say it out loud which i i mean i did practically nothing other than do what i should do which is be honest and authentic and it really it was a huge turning point in my life i just felt a huge sense of responsibility um and so i kept talking about it and i talk about it a lot and here we are i started noticing like a feeling of being disconnected when i was probably 18 or 19. i moved out of detroit and to new york when i was i just turned 18. i was like two weeks into being 18. and i was so excited it was all i wanted to do i was going to nyu i was studying musical theater i was living in this beautiful like melting pot cultural city and seeing you know broadway shows each night and it was it was wonderful and i i i just felt like if i wrote my life down on paper i had so many opportunities so much privilege so much access to happiness and yet my feelings were not that as an 18 year old living on her own in new york city i should be like yes like it should be so exciting but it wasn't i felt like i was sort of followed by this weird dark cloud that just didn't allow me to see all the happiness around me and i was lucky that i felt in my bones that that wasn't how i sh i hate to use the word should but should be feeling or how i could be feeling i guess and i was lucky enough that my mom had sat me down and had a conversation with me and she said hey just a quick heads up um i experience these feelings sometimes your grandmother experienced these feelings sometimes she's a nurse and so she recognized that there could be a hereditary component to a serotonin imbalance and she said if you start to feel any of these things just know there are a variety of ways that you can reach out to people or try to fix it and you don't sort of have to live like that it's such a hard thing to talk about like i i don't like that there's any sort of stigma to it but i i get it it's a weird thing to talk about because it's not an affliction that you can see it's like a hard thing to i guess diagnose and also acknowledge and a lot of families or support systems or anyone in your life they don't know how to talk about it especially if they aren't themselves feeling it i think i had an upper hand because my mom had explained it to me in a very medical way early on and i was like oh okay you sort of armed me with the information um about what could happen and maybe it never will but if it did there's access to help i knew that there were all of these ways like talking to a friend finding a therapist talking to a psychiatrist or a psychologist and just knowing that changed everything for me even if you're not experiencing any mental health issues i would hope that you would walk through life being open and ready to be a shoulder if someone needs you because the the reality is we're not all born the same some of us are born with a ton of confidence and then some are born really timid and i just feel like maybe this is just my maternal instincts talking but i just don't want anyone to feel like they don't have a support system so if we collectively as a society like self-care this whole idea should also include caring about each other you know it has to obviously be on the person to identify the feeling and say i need help but then i think it has to be on the people around them that love them to say okay let me see if i can support you you know even if that's just checking in once in a while ,well-being
remember what the stoics say that the whole world is a temple of the gods i mean look at that sunset look at this beach look at this life it hit me at some point during the craziness of the pandemic that that i was an anxious person i mean i knew i used to get anxious about specific things a flight an important meeting getting up on stage in front of people but when all that went away like everyone else you know you're stuck in your house and you realize you're still anxious and of course you're anxious about what's happening in the world but you're just generally anxious the anxiety is in you you might not think of the stoics as anxious people partly because the reputation of the stoics is that they're invulnerable that they're invincible that they have no emotions but we know that marcus aurelius struggled with anxiety because if he didn't he wouldn't have written so many reminders to himself about how to deal with it i'm about a bunch of tried and tested strategies for reducing addressing alleviating hopefully eliminating anxiety in your life i know they've worked for me it's definitely an ongoing battle as it was for marcus aurelius as it was for seneca but these strategies work and so here in today's episode are some stoic strategies for reducing anxiety i hope you like them [Music] little things are not small george washington's favorite expression was manny mickles make a muckle i think zeno said it better he said well-being is realized by small steps but it's no small thing marx really says we assemble our life action by action step by step no one can stop you from that so today as you get discouraged as you look at this gold it's way way off in the distance don't focus on that focus on the immediate task in front of you concentrate like a roman as marcus aurelius says do this thing in front of you as if it's the only thing that matters is if it's the last thing that you're doing in your life and that adds up it's no small thing many michaels make a muckle as washington said stuff adds up that's how you get there one step at a time one day at a time one action at a time one insight at a time just go now marx really says just remember you're lucky to be alive to be alive in this moment even if things are crazy and insane and awful in the world they're also wonderful because you're getting to experience them and to take that for granted to be bitter or jaded or cynical about that it's to waste this gift you've been given and there's a reason they call it the present it is a gift and look even if this is not the most wonderful time to be alive it's the only time in which you are alive so we focus on what we control which is our perceptions our opinion about things without we control not when and where we are we try to make the most of it we try to accept it we try to be grateful for it and that's how we find happiness now in this present moment no matter what's happening in the world [Music] one of my favorite quotes from marcus real is he says you know you don't have to have an opinion about that and i just think about that all the time i don't have to have an opinion about this i can just let it be i can ignore it i can realize it doesn't pertain to me or i can just see it as it is i don't need to say that it's good or bad fair or unfair it just is i'm going to look at it as an objective piece of information it doesn't need me projecting my thoughts or or beliefs or perceptions on it it is you don't have to have an opinion about this the key to tranquility and peace marcus aurelius says is when you stop caring what other people say what other people think what other people are doing he says the tranquility that comes when you care about only what you do and say the tranquility that comes when you stop caring what they say or think or do only what you do a stoic is not someone who stuffs their emotions down that's not it at all the stoics processed their emotions this is why they journaled socrates went around asking these questions this is why seneca would write these letters to his friend lucillus we even have some of marcus aurelius's letters that survived the stokes were not stuffing their emotions down pretending they don't have them they were exploring them that the stoics talk about taking an emotion when it hits you and putting it up to the test observing it meditating on it processing it getting to the bottom of it you know if you just ignore your emotions if you just conquer them to me it's like putting it on a credit card sure you're not having to pay for it now but eventually it's going to come due and the interest is going to make it even more expensive so don't shut your emotions down deal with them process them explore them get through them don't be ruled by them in ignoring them you are guaranteeing that later it's going to be an even bigger deal and you're going to be even more powerless over that emotion so work on your emotions do not fall into this trap the stoics suppress their emotions they domesticate them as the seam tulip says but first that requires facing them and exploring them and coming to terms with them seneca points out that we suffer more in imagination than in reality meaning that all the things we're anxious about the things we worry about the things we spend a lot of time hoping won't happen most of them never do happen there's that great twain quote where he talks about how he's suffered through many things in life and how many of them have never actually happened because that's what he means in our mind we're torturing ourselves we're worried that this could happen and that could happen we're worried about this possibility or that possibility but the reality is now is now you don't control whether that will happen or not what you do control is now you of course control how prepared you are for the adversity of the future the uncertainty of the future but what you mainly control is the present moment take advantage of the present moment don't give up the present moment because you're really worried and off thinking about what could and almost certainly will not happen in the future [Music] no one can harm you at least according to the stoics they can hurt you they can say cruel things they can attack you they can cut you they can make you bleed but to the stoics harm was a choice you decide to see yourself as harmed by it remember eleanor roosevelt no one can make you feel inferior without your consent we choose to feel harmed you are hurt the moment you believe yourself to be epic cheetah said marx really says don't want to be harmed don't choose to feel harmed we control our emotions we control our opinions we control our the story we tell ourselves about what happened and that's why the stoic said you are complicit when you feel harmed you choose to see it that way i do this one thing every single day and you can see i'm a little sweaty right now i just went on a long walk with my kids this is the property there but we just went on this long walk around our property we talked we threw sticks we told stories we were just outside there's this great expression from nietzsche he says only ideas had when walking have any worth and i think that's right even seneca talks about how the mind must be given over to wandering walks he says fields that are not allowed to rest will not bear plants and and he even says that you know the mind will break like an anvil if not rested and so this is really important for me walking is physical activities it is exercise but it's really about letting my mind rest i leave my phone at home i leave my thoughts at home i leave my work at home and i just go outside and i walk and i don't even consider it exercise it's exercise for my mind it's time i spend with my family it's time i spend on my property it's time i spend outdoors it's time i spend practicing gratitude and appreciation this is a thing i do every day without fail whether it's in a parking lot or on a beautiful beach somewhere i go outside and take a walk and so should you people ask like what is the best way to start journaling and the best way to start journaling is to start journaling look there's a bunch of different ones you can do i like the one line a day journal this is just like a moleskine this is a gratitude journal that i like this is the daily stoic journal but it doesn't really matter journal on your phone journal on a scrap of paper on the back of your to-do list it doesn't matter but the idea is that you journal every single day just do it right just get started the best time to have started journaling is a long time ago the second best time is right now so if you want to start journaling start journaling [Music] epictetus tells us that every situation has two handles he says there's the handle that will bear weight and the handle that won't he says you could look at it as your brother has wronged you he screwed you over he's hurt you or you could say i only have one brother this is my brother i'm gonna forgive this person i'm gonna be patient i'm gonna be better we're gonna be better for having gone through this so this idea that every situation you can choose to see it as the way that disempowers you that makes you the victim or you can choose to see it as the opportunity for growth as the thing that will make you better as the thing that will make you stronger for having to wrestle with so i just love this idea and it comes from a person who's not speaking about this ideally like you and i are so privileged compared to epictetus who's born a slave in rome he spends 30 years in slavery but he doesn't see this as a huge disadvantage he sees it as a learning experience as a fate that he's struggling with that's making him stronger he says you've been paired with a tough opponent and this is what's making you olympic class material that's epic to seeing the the right handle in his own situation so whatever you experience today think about this this has two handles which one am i going to pick the one that bare weight that will make me better or the one that won't bear weight that will make me worse if you're struggling with anxiety if you want to do a deep dive into this like i did i highly recommend the daily stoic slay your stress

 So let's make some tea before we have our chat. So today I am having this Fefemin's tea. English is called Peppermint. I've tried the other tea before and it's my first I'm trying the Fefemin's tea. I think in general it's quite pleasant what they have. I have to hold the towel this because there were multiple times. It would just point to the cup. So I have my tea here and just want to have a little chat with myself and maybe it will be helpful for you as well. It doesn't have to be you doing the same thing like I do as trying to make content but anything in life really. That I'm inspired by people around me who are paying attention to details more. I think give you an example. So yesterday at work there were a mess that made by an event that we had on Saturday and I was a little bit frustrated so I didn't particularly clean up everything that I see because we're supposed to have a cleaning surface so I was thinking like you know I could clean on top of what they have done the next day. And then today I got a feedback from my boss saying that like we should give an eye and try to organize things and he make details into for example organizing the sofa picking up the fallen curtains all these things and then it's a little bit me think. First of all my first reaction is that come on it was a mess and we managed to clean one floor there were two floors so there was really limited time and then the elevator wasn't working so I feel like I am in the right of the progress that I've done. And I owned up to my mistakes and I told my boss that like it was me asking the other colleague that no need to do deep cleaning because the cleaning surface will come because I don't want to give more work to someone else who didn't make the mistakes or arrangement. But then later on I said to feel a little bit different. I said to think in a different angle the reason why my boss is saying the things that he said and then he is doing the things that he do is because he is a dedicated person and the person that cares about detail so it doesn't matter if something's gone wrong he still helps a standard that wants to give the best experience to the members. Mind you is a working space so the space would be used by other people so I've learned the self reflection here thinking. In life many times I am not exactly giving my 100% and there are times that I giving my 100% and today or yesterday it was the time that I'm not giving my 100% and I was consciously doing so because I was also not happy about what happened at work is that before the event starts their community manager asked me to borrow and if they can use so many things when in fact the floor wasn't paid by them because they are our members and I don't get into details so basically they didn't pay so I was communicated that all we could provide is the value and we cannot give more resources on that. And then after that I on Monday when I see the mess or the things that we agree on that I remind the community manager to do we're not fulfilled I am disappointed because I feel like the person could also communicate with me that they haven't done this and the worst things happen was that the person telling my boss that something broke and it was already broken when I was doing this tour around the space before the events. I was speechless and the first reaction I was like really did I miss it? That was like a test book gaslighting and I mentioned it during the meeting and I said I feel like she's like gaslighting me and I keep going through my memories trying to prove that like there must be a time stamp or points that prove that that thing wasn't broken. In that case it was because there were other events that happened before the event so if it's already happened it's just impossible and I'm glad that my boss is a very understanding that they say like don't think too much about it I already immediately said that it's nonsense and they ask me to not get gaslighted by the person and I'm thinking why I'm so uncertain about myself so then it brings us to back to myself why do I second guess myself? When other people are not even me but they are very sure that like that's impossible so that's one reflection that I'm having because to be honest it does happen in life in the past that people would gaslight and I tend to self-doubt and gradually thankfully working this job building up my confidence in the way that I didn't know secretly that I believe I am a person that is capable of doing what I'm doing and that I've been doing good job and I am dedicated so they have been recognized and I'm thankful for that and growing older also means that I see through more things or other people with the behavior and actions and words and in the same sense I judge people much easier now basically you can tell someone's personality by small stuff and I hold the same standard for myself because I'm definitely not perfect I can be also deceival but in the sense of having a higher self awareness and choose to be a person that I want other people to be as well so people would like to say treat other people how you would like to be treated in this case I don't really feel like that person probably gets through life by doing the same thing same pattern lying about things or gaslighting people to get to where she is and it could be her upbringing so I'm not gonna get into detail but it makes me angry it makes me pissed because I was trying so hard out of my way to be of convenience for them and I was wish to be treated the same but it wasn't the case so I think that has a change effect on me not giving my best when it comes to tidy up the place because yesterday there were none of our team except one person at work so I don't want to clean up everything trying so hard with Del Dem seeing how messy it was because I did take pictures but the pictures just not reflecting how it actually is so subconsciously and consciously I was making this decision but with the feedback now I understand that at the end of the day oh my foot is here um yeah at the end of the day um I just feel like it's definitely something I don't need to do it this way next time I think this time I feel good because normally if people blaming on me not blaming like giving me feedback like this I would feel unhappy because I feel like I have all the reasons to not do what I do but I feel good because I listened to my emotions and mood and not stretching myself to just to get it done because I feel that it's injustice for myself um so even though I resist this feedback I actually feel fine I can see it from a very neutral perspective that being a boss being in the owner of the space thing they definitely want to make things good regardless of what happened regardless of how the people feel so um I feel like I still done the things that is good for me because I have a feeling that if I stretch myself trying so hard to clean up everything I would just feel all this resentment um and the recognition probably won't be able to compensate how I feel because at the end of the day I was the only one that is receiving this kind of feeling um so I don't know what do you think about this I think at the end of the day is important to how we feel about ourselves nobody can help you feel how you feel so you're responsible for all feelings so just do things in a way that no not harming others but take care of your own feelings I definitely think I handle the situation very differently compared to the usual khaki because um people pleaser is such a disease and I um people please a behavior it's something that I have been called out before and I recognize it but not to the extent to this very granular deep level so this even actually and talk about this actually help me think so reflect so next time I wish I could be also the person to talk to that person again up to express my disappointment because my boss even though he's really young he actually asked me to do that and I in the end didn't really do it because I don't want to do it and why do I want to do it is because confrontation to expressing my resentment I feel like it does not really serve um for the next corporation but I should remember it and the next time if something like this events about to happen I need to bring it up and remind the person um so yeah I am happy with what how I do with the situation and thank you for listening to this rant and I hope it helps you to reflect on how do you feel about situation and do you want to prioritize your own feeling I know it's also a privilege because a lot of times um people have a lot of different obligations and they have to put down the ego put down the emotions and then just get things done and I especially feel like men are false to do so and so I want to at least tell you that sometimes it's okay to do that because at the end of the day nobody feels how you feel and you are responsible for your own feelings and I hope you have a great day and I'll see you next time,well-being
" Hi, Professor. I'm going to play my audio that I've submitted for myself reflection and hope that you can hear it through this method and then I'll upload the video. So let's see how it goes. I'm going to turn up the volume and just hit play. Hi, this is Arthi Chandra with her submission for my first critical self reflection. Question one, how do the films watched up to this point make you film? The films I've watched up to this point have overall made me feel grateful and inspired for the history and the experiences of the Italian people. I really love learning about the connection between the films and life post World War II, the relationship between Neuralism and the everyday people who became the actors and the film goers. I loved watching films about characters who would have been the everyday people of Italy at the time. And the emotions that start up when I watched them is I felt very curious, focused, happy, sad, delight, heartbreak, anger, appreciation, wonder, intrigue, and so many more things. Memories of my own family, relationships, dreams, and everyday life came up for me as I watched these films. Did I relate to the films? Why or why not? I really related to the experience of loneliness that Antonio felt in the crowds during bicycle thieves. I really related to penis care for her family in open city. Francesca's discovery and appreciation of sisterhood and bitter rice was something that I related to. A mother's determination and desire for a better life for her daughter and Belissima spoke to me. The lead female in Lestrado, the sadness she felt as she left her family behind and started a new life. I have felt that in my own life as well. And the realization of disconnection in a long-term relationship I can journey to Italy was something that I also related to. The next question, what have you learned from their readings? How has has film criticism taught you something? Their readings and film criticisms have taught me a lot about the film's messages and backgrounds. I learned about open city being shot on black market film. I learned about the message of a son's love being the most valuable possession. In bicycle thieves, I learned about the influence of U.S. films and Hollywood and bitter rice. I learned about the relationship between Visconti and the main actress and I and Belissima. I learned that Phelini's wife played Belied in Lestrado. I learned that many that great art may not be appreciated at first as was for the film Journey in Italy and that sometimes it takes time for others to appreciate what you believe in. What ideas, topics, or directions were missed from criticism and what do you think could be pursued to understand the film's better? I would have liked the criticisms to discuss the topic of why Journey to Italy was in English. We'll lead to this change. How did it come about and why? How did this change the tone, message, and style compared to Visconti's other films? It would be nice to read about how the film would be different if the characters spoke Italian and because it was the first film of the series that was in English, I would like to hear more about the journey of that decision. So that is my first self reflection. Thank you for listening. All right, let's see the audio catches.",well-being
" Hello, besties. I don't even know how to start this video. So if you haven't been able to tell, I haven't been very active this month across all my social media platforms. I kind of gave a brief explanation in my last video about my mental health struggles. So I'm just gonna come out and say it. I am not okay. I know I'm smiling and I also kind of explained in my last video that when I'm on camera, I am a genuinely happy person because I like to be happy on camera. But to be brutally honest, I have been in a depressive episode for the past two months. Yeah, which is why I have not been very active at all this month because I've literally just been depressed. And I'm gonna be blunt. Like there's no sugar coating around it. And again, I have a smile on my face right now. That's because I'm feeling good to film and it's making me very happy because every single day this past month, I've just been wanting to film videos like I love to do. And today I woke up and I feel kind of okay, which is good. Considering yesterday, I did not leave my bed at all except to go get food and that's not an exaggeration. I didn't go outside for like 48 hours. So it's been deep. It's been a deep dark hole I've been in. And yeah, I just feel kind of good today. And I wanted to film even though I don't know what I'm gonna do. But I already took a walk, which is something that I also have not been doing. You know what I'm gonna do right now? I'm gonna talk about things I've been struggling with because I've seen this over TikTok and stuff like that. Just, you know, some influencers talking about what they've been struggling with. I think the idea kind of came from Victoria, Paris. I don't really know. But yeah, let's do a quick little deep dive in the introduction of this video. And if I don't scare you guys away, then that's really cool. That's awesome. Cool. I don't mean to unload a bunch of stuff right now in the beginning of the video, but um it is what it is. Like I said, my main struggle is I've been just depressed. And it's one thing being depressed and then another thing, observing that you're depressed, especially too when I've made so much progress over the last year, you know, the nasty little thoughts in my head are telling me. I've just regressed. I have relapsed. I don't know if that's the right word, like relapsing to depression. I'm a failure. That type of stuff, you know, the words that aren't actually yours, but they still attack you. Especially to lying in bed all day for 16 hours a day that doesn't make me feel great. Even though I lightly can't get up and do anything. I haven't been walking or exercising or doing any of my habits such as yoga, meditation, I journal a little bit. Um, when I have the energy too, I've literally just been rotting my brain away on TikTok and reading books. And another reason why I haven't been exercising and stuff, because I usually do an hour long walk every day. Like that's been my main form of exercise, but it's been so freaking hot. Like I turned off my fan, not even for five minutes, you can tell my face is probably going to be completely oil-sliced by the end of this because it's so hot out and it's making me miserable. And you know, seasonal depression usually comes in the winter, but it's hidden me this summer. That's been tough because you know, the sunlight and the exercise are major factors in keeping me personally happy. And I have not been able to do them because it's so hot in miserable outside that yeah, I could force myself to walk, but it wouldn't be enjoyable to me. And then as I kind of alluded to, like I've just been wanting to film so much, but obviously I'm not going to film because I'm one not doing anything until I'm not feeling good. Today woke up and I felt pretty good. Could be the new medication that I'm on. The little happy pills, uh, told you I'm going to be brutally honest right now. But yeah, it's been really, really, really tough recently. Every day my brain has been screaming at me to get up and do things. Just one thing, whether it be a quick little yoga session or a stretch or a walk, and you know when you're depressed, you just can't. No matter how much you want to, you just cannot. But today I'm feeling like I can do something. Which is my stomach's rumbling, which is one thing I need to go to the store and get some food because I'm hungry and I don't have the food I want in the house right now. And I feel good enough to do some yoga. I actually did go for a walk. I think I said that already. But yeah, okay, we're five minutes in. Sorry, that was a lot, but I'm just trying to be open and honest because I owe it to myself and I don't really owe it to anyone else, but I feel like I owe it to the greater good of the internet. Be honest and open about mental health because it's not pretty. It's not. I changed out of clothes I was wearing for about four days. Like I said, I didn't leave my bed at all of our shanae except to literally get up and eat or pee. Okay, let's go to the store. Haven't been out like all week. So let's go to Target. I literally have my hair up already because it's so hot, but here's the fit. It's so basic. That's just been like another thing that's been feeding into my sadness is because it's so hot that I can't wear anything but a tank top in shorts every day. And I don't like these type of clothes. Like I have no sense of fashion. Can I express myself the way I want to? Therefore I hate the way I look every day. Don't leave my house because I wear the same four tank tops and pairs of biker shorts every day. And I just feel like not myself because they're just nothing but clothes to like keep me cool. Like it's there's nothing exciting about my outfits or fashion. So I don't want to leave the house. So that's another thing. That's like a first world problem though. Anyway, let's go to Target. Okay, Target haul. I'm quite cute. My bag is I really wish I could tell you where it's from, but it does not have a tag on it or anything. I got a very little mail on stuff because I really just need it some fruits but I picked up other things. Saltines because I genuinely enjoy eating saltines at the snack. I decided to treat myself to some ice cream because I haven't had it in a bit. And I never tried this one before. The Oatly and I got mint chocolate chip because mint chocolate chip is superior. And if you don't like it then you are a child. I'm more granola. Also, never tried this before. This is the mixed berry granola. You know how much I love they've been added out one. Thought I would switch it up. It's been on a huge fruit berry kick because pretty much I've just been eating cold foods for salad yogurt because I can't tolerate anything hot. I really sound like such a wimp, but this heat is just really getting to me this year. I got some apples and then craving apples like crazy. I want to lie. I made a massive thing of strawberries which was surprising because not gonna lie. Target strawberries usually suck like they would like look horrible the time they happen at it. And right now, oh wait, I also got these coasters. They're just little plastic coasters because I need some coasters. And right now I'm going to show you my favorite meal. I've been eating recently. Like you guys can tell by my videos. I find food and then I eat it for like two months straight. This is my current like bird fixation meal. It is a yogurt. This is a vegan. Obviously yogurt. So delicious vanilla. Really basic. Honestly, I think all vegan yogurts taste the same. So choose whichever one is the best. Just don't be and I like to get some protein powder. This is the Vega protein and greens vanilla one. Doesn't really matter again. I would say stick to vanilla. I do half a scoop because a whole scoop would just be two powdery from the yogurt. I think if you have strawberries and just wash them and then just slice them up into the yogurt. Yes, I'm slicing it on my hand. I don't feel like getting a whole plate and like dirty dirty dirty dirty or dirty. Yeah, you can see where this is going. And finally, granola on top. And there we go. Strawberry, banana, yogurt bowl. Also has some good protein from the protein powder and it's so refreshing. Delicious. Like I said, I've been eating this every single day for like the past two weeks or so and I just mix it all around and it's just cool refreshing. So okay. So now that I ate and I'm feeling good and full I'm gonna do some yoga. I'm going back to my roots to my home girl. My yoga with Adrienne. She is the best yoga practitioner on YouTube and I'm gonna do a hips and lower back yoga because they've been hurting because I've just been lying in bed all day and my body has been due to your ratings. It's like 20-ish minutes so we're gonna do that. Okay, so I just finished my yoga feeling really good. I haven't felt this good in a while. So I'm gonna end it with some meditation when I'm grabbing some crystals. It has been a hot minute since I visited my little crystal shelf and used them so very sorry y'all. But I'm gonna grab these two which are really good for grounding a meditation. This reddish one on top is Mahogany Obsidian and this one is called Apache Tear and then I'm gonna grab my rose quartz for my heart chakra because I have a lot of tension in my chest and around my heart chakra. I'm gonna get that and then I'm also gonna get some amethyst which helps ease in anxiety and just it's a very calming stone. So going to go lay on my floor. I'm taking it back to the old days where I would do yoga meditation on my floor and then I just like to put them to kind of their corresponding chakra. Also this is just kind of how I use them. It doesn't mean it's right or wrong. I know there's a lot of like controversy about like crystals and chakras and stuff like that. I just do it for me. It will feel good. So amethyst on the third eye. I'm gonna put this on my heart chakra if it wants to stay. Maybe not. Maybe I'll put it down there and then these two and like my lower stomach for like grounding. And then I'm just gonna lay here on the ground for however many minutes and just zone out but intentionally because I've been dissociated for the past two months but now I'm doing it intentionally. At least I can joke about my issues. That's the one good side of mental illness. You can make good jokes about it. Maybe that's on a good side. Okay. Okay so now that we already did yoga and meditation might as well finish it out with some journaling. Complete my little triple threat of usual daily habits of yoga meditation and journaling and I haven't done all three of these in the day in weeks but I don't know why I'm feeling so good today but I'm going for it. Yeah so I'm just going to journal. Also I wish this was highlighter and intentional. It's not. I'm just greasy as hell. Remind you to just ignore the fan if you hear it in the background. I know it's probably annoying but me sweating to death is more annoying so. It's been a hot minute since I seen you last. I think I was journaling. I've been at my computer. Currently being eliminated by this video. My computer. I'm trying to buy a bookshelf. I mentioned this in one of my last vlogs and I want a bookshelf because I've got a lot of books. However I just can't simply buy something. I must research and read every single review ever written about whatever item it is I'm looking for. So I've been literally searching for a bookshelf for like two hours when I'm literally all I want is an open white bookshelf. However none of them are meeting my criteria. There is one that I want but it's out of stock. It's an Ikea one and it's out of stock everywhere and I can't get it shipped to me so I was planning on getting that one but it hasn't been in stock in like weeks. That's what I've been doing with my time. Can you tell me Gemini and very indecisive but literally I must have just went through every single white bookshelf on Amazon and read all the reviews and I don't like any of them. But what I'm going to do with my time now is the question because I've already wasted a lot of time but I did get a lot done which I am proud of myself for and I feel good right now. I don't know why maybe because I'm talking to the camera and you know actually doing things. I don't know I'll probably keep looking for a bookshelf. I'll probably read. I'm currently reading the Twilight series and I'm on new moon right now. I picked up the entire Twilight series of a Facebook marketplace for five dollars. All four books. These big boys are five dollars. I had to drive like 30 minutes to and from to get them so it cost more gas than I did for me to get them but it was very good purchase. I've never read them before. I've seen all the movies multiple times but those are about time that I read them so this is what I'm currently working on halfway through it. This is another hard part of just mental health just being completely disrupted from all of your routines and reality and everything like that because now I don't know what like now I literally have to like re-learn how to go be a human the next couple days if I'm still feeling good. If I'm feeling at this level of good that I am right now I literally have to go re-teach myself how to be a human being and integrate myself into the world so that's something. Now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go eat my ice cream that I just bought. Let's go get some. It is very very creamy. It's very good like real ice cream consistency however it needs a stronger mint flavor. The mint is like barely there. Chocolate chips are good though. Need more mint. I buy mint chocolate chip for the mint. Hello. Good morning besties. What did I end up doing last night? Still looking for a bookshelf and coming up unsuccessful. So this morning I want to make some pancakes. I don't know why I'm just really craving them. I'm gonna show you my favorite recipe that I make except this recipe I'm gonna like modify it a lot. So it's not even the same with your recipe at the time. Okay so the first thing we're gonna do is actually make some oat flour which you can use normal flour but I just like you know to help benefit of oats so just take the major minnacles put it in a blender blend it up and then you have flour. Okay these are my pajamas too. Thank you. Would you look at that now it's flour. So besides for the flour part we're gonna start with the wet ingredients first. We need a two separate bowls, one for dry, one for wet. So you're gonna take your milk. You're not in dairy milk I'm using oat milk which I always find weird when I'm baking with oats and then oat milk it feels wrong in some way. I don't know why. A tablespoon of white vinegar into your milk and I know it sounds really weird. It's not gonna taste like vinegar what it does with the plant milk. It kind of like curls it and makes like a thick buttermilk like consistency. So we do the wet ingredients first so that has time to sit and get a little bit thicker. I promise you it doesn't taste like vinegar. I like a teaspoon of oil. Alright now for the dry. I'm gonna use brown sugar. I've never tried brown sugar before but I feel like it will be good you know I normally just use normal like white sugar. We need some baking powder. Interesting. Alright and now that the milk has been sitting with the vinegar and oil we're just going to mix them together. Then going to make these the nano walnut pancakes because you can't just have a plain pancake. I was gonna do blueberries because we just got some blueberries but I'm really feeling some like cozy banana walnut pancakes you know what I forgot which I do every time until I actually about to go put them on a stove add a splash of vanilla and some cinnamon to your pancake batter that this is a crucial step and I literally almost forget every time. Alright so here we go my beautiful plate of pancakes and typically I would be enjoying this with a nice hot cup coffee but if you can tell by the sheen on my face I'm already sweating from cooking these pancakes. But now in a walnut it's just a superior flavor combination. It's been like two or so hours since I ate and this is a problem with um I guess now I'm coming out of my depressive episodes and feeling pretty okay. It's like I kind of mentioned yesterday like reintegrating back into life because I have no idea what to do with myself. I haven't done anything in weeks. I've just been paralyzed in my room in my bed. I haven't done anything so I have to like reteach myself how to be a human and I'm kind of paralyzed now not because of my mood but because I literally don't know what to do with myself at the moment and I would love to like go outside go for a walk or something but it's like 85 degrees out which might not seem hot to some people I know okay chill on me, southerners and whatnot but now I'm just like huh I really haven't done anything in weeks. What do I do now? Guess I'll come back to when I figure it out. Spoiler I did not figure it out. I didn't do anything. Thank you guys for watching this is obviously an outro because I forgot to film one as I do for every video but yeah genuinely just thank you for watching I just ask you be kind in the comments I know everyone's mental health proves that it's differently in mind especially differently because I'm like on camera and then editing it and then posting it yeah so like don't take everything for face value but I am trying to just be like open and honest about things and I am generally feeling better these past couple days which is good so I'm expect to see some more content from me especially this upcoming week because I have really really good content coming I don't think you guys are ready I hope you made it this far if you made it this far tell me you're excited for the upcoming week because I don't think you guys are ready and it's actually getting me excited for life that's a little too deep okay goodbye um I hope you have a wonderful day and night wherever you are and make sure that you stay tuned for my next video",well-being
" Alright, what's going on guys? Welcome back to A Brand New Video. In the same spot as last week's video, I just thought this was like the right place and the right vibe. I feel like to record these type of videos. Last week I know I talked about feeling purposeless and this week I wanted to talk about perspective and hope and a lot has happened in the past week I went to Abu Dhabi for a work trip and I had a lot of fun man. I'm not going to lie, I had a lot of fun. I accomplished a lot of goals and you know things that I wanted to do for so long. I sort of sat down and I was like man two years ago, I'm looking at what I'm doing right now. I would freak out. Even though all that happened, one of the best moments for me was I actually got to see one of my family members as well as out there and I saw my uncle and I haven't seen family in about eight months since moving over here and it was really nice because this isn't someone that I've been particularly close to. This past like man I don't even know maybe like 15 years of my life but it was really nice catching up with him and just seeing how similar we are as we've got an older obviously when you're a kid it's hard to relate to adults in general but I think as you get older you start to see yourself more in these people and when I went out to Abu Dhabi I was still dealing with a lot of the things that I had talked about in my previous video. I just found you know after really sitting down with my uncle I had a different perspective on things. It was funny because he lives in Australia and he was complaining about his living situation in Australia and what he kept saying to me over and over again was he wishes that he could leave Australia and he's planning to move to Dubai and all he was saying to me was how much he hates living in Australia and just like how bad it is and you know all the negatives about it and funnily enough like if me and him had had that conversation eight months ago I would have related to him and been like I fully agree man these past eight months have given me a different perspective on things and after that conversation you know I have a new perspective on this whole situation and what I talked about in my last video was this feeling of wanting something else and wanting more and just never feeling fulfilled or satisfied with things and it's funny I think when you can't see the answers in front of you or you don't have the answers I think sometimes you know God and the universe will supply you with a way for you to see the answers. What I realized in that moment was that no matter where you are in life whether or not you're happy has to do with your perspective on your current situation. Happiness is definitely a choice it's got to be because a week later from recording my last video in the same situation I was not not much has really changed except for I've got a new experience under my belt but I feel happier than I did last week and I think the reason for that is just a flip in my perspective a little bit it just gives me a lot of hope because I've been reading this book lately called The Alchemist and something it really talked about was just this feeling of being present and recognizing the omens in your life the biggest thing I've been missing in life this past like you and a half has just been this presence I haven't had the presence when I was a little bit younger and I was just starting on my journey of chasing and trying to find my purpose I had a lot of presence and was able to recognize situations and opportunities when they were right in front of me and I think as I got older and stress started building and I started going through things I sort of lost that ability to be present and I was so focused on the past and the future that I wasn't able to see opportunities right in front of me for so long and I feel like I've missed out on a lot these past couple of months because I've been just not present and I feel like God and the universe has just been providing me with all these opportunities like it does for everyone like we're all our main characters in our own movies and I just feel like I haven't been present to really capitalize on them and make the most of them. Part of that makes me a little bit sad because I'm like what have I missed but then at the same time if these things are happening for a reason or then I'll supposed to go through that phase and you know even though I feel like I've viewed off track a little bit it's funny how the world works where it presented me with this opportunity to meet up with my uncle for him to almost be a mirror and show me how I was acting and I just found it funny because the same way he was describing his living situation in Australia is the same way that I'm currently describing my new sort of living situation in the UK and I just think it's sort of a never ending cycle until you truly learn how to be sort of more present with yourself and see the opportunities in your life and make the most of them because nothing will ever be enough if you're constantly looking to the next thing or you're constantly living in the past and I don't know so it's a beautiful thing because you start recognising the beauty in your surroundings and you're like where have I been these past few months because these things have been here this whole time I just haven't been able to see them. I really think happiness is a choice and not something to be attained that's it that's what I wanted to say thank you guys for watching and enjoy the rest of your day.",well-being
" When I had that very many episodes earlier this year, when I was hyper-hypes, changing the colour shades of the trousers, hanging in the wardrobe so that they went in one proper sort of gradation. And I suppose some people call it OCD. Forgive me, but you talk rapidly and you always have. When you go a bit high, do you notice that speeds up? I don't notice it as much as those close to me do. Yeah, my sister does very clearly and well, well, text me straight away after we've had a conversation on the phone. The friends and family. Yeah. The sense that you've gone a little high. Some people think that being high is a rather jolly, happy, great place, but I think it times it makes you quite stressed as well, would you? Absolutely. This particular time I was saying, I think to you and certainly to my close friends and family, I said, you know, I, please don't. I'm a sensitive, I have an ambulance, but I think I know how Joan of Arc felt.

" My name is Riley Douglas and I'm from Utah. I suffered from major depressive disorder and severe anxiety. I was referred to serenity by my therapist. I was balancing from therapist to therapist multiple times and trying all these different medications until I found a great therapist. And then he referred me to TRITMS and so let's give it a shot. It's been like 15 years now. I've just been struggling with depression and anxiety. Work was hard just due to me not having any motivation, you don't want to be there. Just when you don't have any goals, you don't want to do good at anything. And of course in my personal life, just being short tempered and just again not motivated. And I just didn't want to invest in anyone. So I just went away from everybody and tried to be by myself as much as I could. Depression to me felt like a big weight on my back and on my chest. And it just felt like after a really hard workout where you're just tired and it just felt like it took all the energy out of you. And you never wanted to do anything, no matter how much sleep you got, no matter what you did or how many copies you drank or you were just always tired and you never wanted to do anything. Just felt like everything was pointless. My experience was serenity was phenomenal. It's just from the very first appointment of seeing what options were all the way and up until the very last one was all amazing. My experience in during TRITMS was it was fun. My technician was awesome and it just felt like a friendship and the positivity just having to be positive for those 30 minutes while I was in treatment, it changed everything. It's everything that I learned during treatment, helped more than any therapist. Someone told me that they don't want to put effort into themselves and they don't deserve or they know TMS won't work. I'd tell them that they're wrong. Because that's exactly what I felt bouncing from every category of medication and every type of treatment and kind of coming to this and not knowing a ton about it and thinking that it's rainbows and butterflies, it's worth it. It's real. There's no way to describe it other than try it. Prior to TMS, everything was, I felt like everything was a chore, everything was a task. Anything from doing laundry to even just waking up in the morning, everything just felt like it was the hardest thing to do in the world. And now that I feel like I have my life back, I think about the future a lot more. I think about having a family or thing about starting a business. It's just really everything's a possibility now. Rather than thinking a week ahead, I think five years ahead and that's something I can't be more than thankful for.",well-being
" I didn't have any friends and if people wouldn't really approach me I would just sit alone at lunch table. The need of constantly wanting to fit in but at the same time You just don't fit in because I felt like I don't belong. I feel like I shouldn't stand out even when you do belong Into like a certain group you feel like an imposter Hi everyone welcome back to my channel this week We are going to be talking about feeling like an outcast specifically for those who just constantly feel like they don't belong Almost like you're born in an outcast. This is something that I want to talk about because I've dealt with it my whole life Being born Asian-American as a kid being shy and triverted growing up ugly I didn't have any friends and if people wouldn't really approach me and I remember we just do a lot of times in middle school I would just sit alone at lunch table I would bring a book and basically pretend that I'm reading to not look like To not feel like a loser and I would have a few friends But sometimes like if they're not there I would just read. I didn't have like the popular You know the popular girls clothes and remember uggs were a huge thing north-faced jackets were a huge thing I didn't have those so there was an appearance wise when I was younger and then I'm like all older It was the anxiety aspect of it like especially in social settings I don't know how people just go very smoothly There's people who have a lot of connections at these social events and they would just go up to people and just go Hey, what's up? And I remember there was this once back in like freshman year of college They said this upper class and then I was walking back from class and she was like oh, we should come to this party And I was like I was a freshman. I was like yeah sure. Why not? I went there. I literally stood there Everyone's like taking shots and I was scared and want to take a shot and I was there And I just felt so outcasted everyone was talking. I stood there people looked at me and nobody wanted to approach me Was in social and also at that period of time I didn't really dress up and I didn't seem inviting. I guess I was really stiff there I have been in friend groups with a thing with that they do get toxic towards the end I remember like when I was in friend groups. I felt really really Trapped like I feel like I can't go meet other people. I don't have a current friend group right now Yeah, it feels lonely and it just feels like you don't belong you don't belong anywhere Like you know people that can just like text their friends if you hey can you we like just hang out? I don't have that friend group anymore I'm like friends with individual people because for me I feel that that causes less drama when there's arguments within friend groups It can end up really badly and that's happened to me before and I don't want that to happen again And I guess like this is why people are in relationships because it makes them feel like people long They belong to another person. Oh, maybe that's a bad way to but you guys know what I mean They have this connection with this other person. They're always going to be there for them right for me is just I I don't have that and this has always been my entire life I'm always on my own little island Everyone is you know in groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and groups and I'm just in my own little island Right here and it gets lonely because I feel like as a human everyone craves Connection so then usually when you don't belong You would try to fit in and whether that's like changing your appearance or you know changing your personality Or you know, whatever it is. I've done that. I've changed my appearance But also I will say that I changed my appearance due to myself like self care But a part of it was also I want to fit in I want people to like me I want to make friends and then I also changed my personality Which I would link the video right here where I talked about growing up ugly I was very introverted and I'm also Extroverted in some aspects, but I you know amplified it I tried to become more extroverted than I am and then it was hard to keep up the need to constantly wanting to fit in But at the same time you just don't fit in was exhausting or maybe it could also just be I haven't found the right people Which goes to my next point which is the fact that I just have to stop trying to fit in I really stopped trying to fit in and one of the prime examples of me not trying to fit in is posting on social media Back then when I was just so scared to post on social media because I thought of what people think of me What really got me through was the fact that I then fit it in the first place So who cares about post on social media? I'm not gonna like lose a bunch of friends because I did have a lot of friends to begin with True friends will stay by me and so at the end just be unapologetic We yourself as well. I learned because fitting in is so exhausting like even now I feel like I have boy social functions because I'm scared that the part of me of wanting to fit in I want to belong in like a group to talk to people and not just stand alone by myself Freaks me out, but these days I realized that I would only go to certain social functions If I'm comfortable enough if I'm comfortable with the other person then I would go Even now like even though I don't belong in any certain groups even like I am Asian-American I often just feel like I'm not Asian enough because I don't speak Mandarin as well Because I can speak Mandarin fluently, but I can't text it And also when I'm with my Asian-American peers, I just tend to feel I also don't fit in Because like a lot of them have grown up watching certain TV shows and for me I didn't grow up watching those certain TV shows and so even as a kid that just never worked out for me I remember as a kid people would talk about certain shows like I Carly or those Disney shows I didn't have access to those as as a kid like I watch a lot of like these Taiwanese historical dramas A lot of my Asian-American friends they would pack certain lunches like spam sandwich or like peanut butter San like my mom packed these parking league dumplings And I remember I would get made fun of in middle school because I would open it and it would it would have a certain scent I remember this as one girl she was on the park right girl I remember she was sitting at the end of the table and she was like She finally got things again I remember I felt so insecure I literally went back to my mom I was like mom don't pack me those dumplings And I feel so bad she must have been so confused But me as a middle school kid I just wanted to fit in and having like those kids say that It just made me feel really awful Because I felt like I don't belong I feel like I shouldn't stand out because I already don't belong And so if I even stand out it just emphasizes the fact that I don't belong So I would lower myself fit into that image that was already presented for me I was really focused on my academics I wouldn't wear makeup I wouldn't wear a certain clothes because I didn't have a good support group I didn't have like a supportive friend group or a certain community that would be like But when I got to college I changed my personality I made a friend group I was more like embracing myself Because I wanted to fit into a group so bad those friends that I had were not that compatible to begin with We didn't share a lot of the same values towards like you know like sophomore junior year I realized that maybe I just don't need to fit in I really wish that I could sit here and be like it's okay to not belong anywhere Even now I'm still trying to deal with it because it gets lonely And this year I really tried to meet more people I'm also more introverted in a sense so it's got also kind of hard for me I am trying And I feel like it also goes to the fact that I'm a pretty awkward person too I do find in certain social settings but sometimes it just I also get Pretty anxious for social settings Even when you do belong into like a certain group you feel like an imposter You feel like a fraud It's almost like you feel like you need to create the sense of person in order to fit in with other people When you grow up as a kid not fitting in with your peers It gets harder when you become an adult and then you you try to fit in and then you find that to be exhausting And then you came to the conclusion that maybe you just don't need to fit in But then when you don't need to fit it it makes you feel very alone Before I was always like I don't need to fit in who needs to fit in it's a completely fact Like I want to do my own thing by the same time I really want to be open to other people Or even like a place I don't know where exactly I belong to The lesson here about I want is to fact that if I did belong I don't think I would have done social media Basically back then I used to spam on my private Snapchat story And then I felt like annoying even though I'm forcing them to click on it Which is click on it by still I feel bad So just start spamming on my TikTok So here I am making YouTube now and I post on Instagram too So I feel like that's generally if I fit in I don't think I would have post on social media I wasn't in a friend group like no it was gonna make fun of me I was like there's nothing to lose I'll just post whatever I think that was kind of like a bit of the start where I kind of realize the fact that I don't need to belong I'm just gonna do whatever I'm not losing anything anyway like who cares I do want to meet people that I share a genuine connection with I want to keep building my own little community of people This is something I struggled with my entire life I feel like I've never belonged anywhere And it's scary but the thing that I can tell you is that Stop trying Stop trying to belong because it gets exhausting When you don't belong you can't get yourself to belong somewhere So when you stop trying to belong you'll eventually find a place of where you belong Just be yourself Be yourself do your thing because it's so easy to just fake away Into being with people that you don't actually want to be with When you're just yourself you're gonna attract people Where you feel like oh my god like actually genuinely hang out with this person It makes me feel really great about myself That's my note to you guys So yeah I hope this video spoke to some of you guys And also helped some of you guys This is my journal entry number four To anyone who feel like they don't belong I will see you guys all next week Yeah Bye which",well-being
" guys, this video is kind of all over the place. Before I kind of get into like the part or the clip of me like reflecting about everything, I wanted to give a little bit of a background about my high school experience and things that I've gone through in college. My freshman sophomore, junior, senior, all throughout high school, I never really felt like I had like a solid, solid friend group. I did my freshman year of high school with like a group of girls. I came into high school not knowing anyone because I switched schools. I like school districts so I didn't know a single person going into high school. It was really scary for a little me. Like I said, I had like one strong group of girlfriends and then my freshman, end of freshman year is my COVID hit and so I was just home alone and I did a lot of self-reflection and I basically kind of just realized like these friends are really not like prioritizing the same things that I'm prioritizing. Like they want to hang out every weekend. I don't have time to do that with like the goals that I have. Like I knew from a very young age I wanted to go to a top tier college like Yale was my dream, Vanderbilt was a dream. Like a school like that was like a really big goal for me. People that I was friends with just didn't have the same priorities and there's nothing wrong with that but we just didn't prioritize the same things. That's kind of when I realized like I didn't really want to be friends with them anymore and so I distanced myself and then sophomore junior year was pretty lonely. I didn't really have a lot of people to like lean on. I would get picked on a lot because I didn't really have like a solid friend group. I tried so hard my junior year. I think I could to like fit in with like the cool girls or like that friend group just because like I wanted something. I've always been totally popular. He's not a thing like don't go for being the popular girl in high school because that never works out. Everything ends after you graduate. But I still wanted it. I would get picked on a lot and I would come home from school every day and just like cry my eyes out. It was so hard to like keep the goals that I had in mind when like the immediate fulfillment things that would like bring me joy. Like if I was accepted in the popular group. If a cool girl gave me any sort of like attention and like commented on an Instagram post like I would get so excited. And it would be so hard to like keep my goals in mind because it's like I wanted to go to all these parties that the cool girls were going but I just didn't have time for it. If you are someone who is going through something similar where you are trying to fit in or like you want to be friends with the cool girls or it feels like there's nobody. You have no friends at school and you have these big goals like I did. I promise you everything gets so much better the second people across that stage. Congratulations. The last day of high school I just like felt this way just like lift off less shoulders just doing like I'm never going to see any of these people like I know I know from experience that it is like so hard just like be by yourself and keep your goals in mind especially at a young age in high school where like everything is about like belonging and fitting in and like the hierarchy of like the cool girls or whatever. I just I promise you it is so worth it. Coming from someone who went through the exact same thing. Now I'm at Vanderbilt. I'm in Greece worth it. Just stay true yourself, stick to yourself, do not get distracted by the cool girls or like going out or whatever it is that like you're trying to fit in. If you have any feelings of loneliness or like you don't have any friends like as soon as you graduate it's all going to come to you. Everything that happens to you is happening for you and not to you and it sounds kind of cliche but it's just it's so true. All of these bad experiences that you're having in high school all the times that you feel lonely all the times that you just want to like cry every single night because you feel like you don't have friends all the times where it's nothing in life can ever get worse. That is happening for you. Later in life you're going to have these experiences to talk about like I'm doing right now. You're going to have someone that you're going to inspire by your experiences, how you overcame them. It's going to make you so much stronger in the end. There's just so much more out there after high school. Really big lesson that I want you to know if you're going through anything similar to like bullying anything like that. If you're having a bad time in high school you're not picking in high school like you should be so happy that you're lonely. You have no friends. You can't go out. What's going on right now in your life is happening for you. I think it's going to be okay. Just keep working towards what you want to work towards all your goals. Keep challenging yourself. Just know if you're watching this I love you and keep going. And just trust that everything will work out just the way it's meant to be. You're going to end up exactly where you're meant to be and life is beautiful. I had a really bad roommate situation. I met this girl. I thought she was going to be like the most fun roommate ever. And she was really fun and it kind of started to go downhill because she would kind of go out and like smoke their friends every day. And that's like not something that I really liked to do. And so like I would try and like in order to like keep the friendship. I wouldn't like do it with them but I would like sit with them during the little smoke sessions. And like try so hard. I don't know I just like wanted to be with them because I knew I didn't have anyone else. That kind of went on for a couple months and then I kind of just realized like girl what are you doing? I started to try to branch out. And that's when things like went to shit with this girl. I feel like one thing that I've really struggled with. I've always done in these situations is kind of just be like a people pleaser. So like in order to keep the peace in the friendship I would always just be like okay like you win. Like I'll do whatever you say. And I wouldn't say like I wouldn't let people walk all over me but I would after a point. I would like think that I was standing my ground because I would like say my perspective on an argument or like if there was conflict like I would be like no like this is what I think. But if that other person kept like pushing and pushing I would just be like okay you're right like let's just be friends again. And I think that's something I've always struggled with. If someone and I have in conflict I always always always will avoid it rather than like talk to them about it. I don't know if that's like a fear of like losing them as a friend because of like usually conflict like big conflict doesn't come up until like much later in the friendship when we've been friends for like years or whatever. I feel like I always tell myself like you're really gonna throw away your friendship for this one stupid thing. So like I just kind of say like okay like you're right like let's just go back to like the way it was. I would tell my younger self it's like think of it scale. You have really good times with this person but does that also outweigh the way that they react to conflict or make you feel when something is wrong. And it's also like are the good times even that valuable? Like that's not something that you should be putting yourself through like so much mental English for. If it's not someone that's like really giving you a lot of value and contributing positively to your life then like why put so much of your mental bandwidth towards that because there's so much more. There's so much that you can do like put that elsewhere. I think that's like a really big lesson that I'm still working on. Realize that it's like okay you don't want to like have these friends like feel that so close into your inner circle. And so you kind of like keep them out of distance but then it's like you don't really have anyone that's like a super close friend like that. That's another thing too. For younger Mia to know not letting people in too fast just because it feels like you make like a super good connection with this person. I'm not giving you all to someone when they haven't like shown you that they are going to be like a really strong connection and they're going to contribute a lot to your life. Not same like energy level. I haven't like shown you that yet like there's no reason to let them into like your inner circles then you're just setting yourself up for like all that mental English later on that you don't want to deal with. After you come to that realization. This is where it gets hard for me. Like there's a lot of things I recognize when like things happen to me. I've gone through but I've put myself in positions so many times like over challenges like when I did sales this last summer the really hard experience because I put myself through that something that like someone else my age who hasn't gone through that experience would think like some challenge is way more stressful than it is because they don't have anything else to compare it to. It's why I always put myself. Challenge myself to new experiences like do things that are really uncomfortable. There's a bunch of different things where it's like this really big challenge like seems like it's so big. I remember thinking one day when I was on the doors for the summer 110 degrees outside and so hot and I was like melting there's no wind. There was this like dog chasing me around that probably had rabies and like bugs were biting me. It was just a really rough day. It was one of my first days and I remember thinking like I would give anything right now to be at school like writing a 10 page paper I would give anything to be like in some like stressful exam. I would give anything to like like be in high school like taking an AP exam or like working on my college applications which in high school I thought like those were like there was nothing ever that would be harder than that but it turns out there is graduating from like this challenge to this challenge makes this challenge seem like nothing compared to this challenge. Always put yourself in what I call an unstable environment you can know idea what's gonna happen and like it could be really hard and if it is like just embrace it and know that you are graduating to the next level of challenge that will make all your other challenges look super teeny tiny.",well-being
" My name is Will Wheaton. I am an actor, writer and producer. I have generalized anxiety disorder and I have forget the exact medical term for it, but it's sort of like chronic depression. I wasn't aware of how my mental illness was affecting me until I've been suffering from it for easily 15 or 20 years because what I accepted as just kind of normal was part of my mental illness expressing itself. When I decided to go and get help and see a psychiatrist and actually like looking to getting medication was probably about six or seven years ago. My wife and I were getting ready to go on a trip to Minneapolis. I was performing in a show with some friends and we just had a really horrible time at the airport and the people were really unhelpful and it was super crowded and we were going to miss our flight and I just freaked out and I was like, screw this, I want to cancel the show. I don't even want to go. My wife sat me down at the airport and said, I'm going to take care of this, just sit here and be quiet and when we get back from this trip you really need to go see the doctor. She had seen for a long time that I just had these really bad mood swings where I would freak out at stuff that didn't seem like my reactions to things were way out of proportion to what the actual thing was that was upsetting and it got to be really bad. It was things like this traffic is so bad that rather than sit through like 20 minutes of whatever this traffic is, forget it, I'm going home. And like real irrational decisions and things like that. My doctor told me that it would probably take about three weeks for me to really feel the effects of the medication he put me on and that was because my body needed time to react to how things change and I want to say it was like a week and a half or something like that maybe close to two weeks after I'd started treatment. My wife and I were just having a walk in the neighborhood and I realized that it was like a really beautiful day and it was warm and there was like this wonderful little bit of a breeze and birds sounded really beautiful and flowers smelled really great and my wife's hand felt really good in my hand and we're walking and I just started to cry and she was like what's wrong and I was like I just realized that I don't feel bad. I just realized that I'm not existing and living and the best way that I could describe it is like I lived my life in a room that was so loud all I could do every day was just deal with how loud it was and I found a doorway out of that room and at that moment I realized that the loudness of that room wasn't like oppressing me anymore and I was aware of a ringing in my ears which meant the noise was going away and wasn't coming back and that I was on my way to like having like a normal life that that normal for me was changing that it wasn't constantly worrying about things and it wasn't constantly giving up on stuff and feeling like it's just not worth going to my friend's house because huge list of irrational reasons that I shouldn't go and that I was going to be able to experience things and travel and just like be a person and it's so weird to say that I was like oh right I can be a person now like oh I'm learning how to human and it was the beginning of this journey that continues of learning how to live life with depression rather than living life through depression. Our life is this complicated interaction and intermingling of chemicals in our brains and experiences we have and relationships that we choose and relationships that are chosen for us and sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's hard and as long as you are doing what you can to take care of yourself and to leave every day a little bit kinder than it started things are going to be all right you are not the only person in the world who has anxiety you're not the only person in the world who has depression you're not the only person in the world who has thoughts of self-harm there are people who want to help you there are people who have spent their entire lives helping people like you and me and all of the people that you're seeing in this video and you're not alone you are okay",well-being
" I just opened up the first vlog and I was looking at my picture on here that I haven't changed. It was probably like since 2016, 2015 or something. I'll insert it. I'm just like, where did she go? Where did this girl go? She was being with creativity, like oozing out of her. I always feel like doing these vlogs is kind of like returning me to her anyway because I don't care how many views I get. I don't think anyone will watch these but it's kind of fun anyway because the joy back then and the joy that I'm realizing again is in the act of doing, not in the views or whatever. You must be prepared to work always without the vlogs. I feel like that. It's kind of like my journey. I had a journey back into YouTube and to this self of who I was where I just did and didn't care about the applause or what would come up. It was just almost instinct to create. I have to do a showing at 130 and I think it's like 11-something. But I want to fact here, the house a little bit. So I don't know if you guys can hear it in the play. These were going to another album. It's stunning. Every time I get here, I'm in Toronto, the house. I just like to stop. Listen. My mind blowing up. I could have this incredibly moving music. I actually didn't have time to vacuum. I just did a showing at my listening and time to go. Tonight. The work today has been so difficult my day. It may be tough to do, I can not really at night. Sister you're so good hope Lor, that nothing more than driving the CBT So call her and or team up o let I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I'm going to show you something. I really hate feeling rushed. I don't think I'm supposed to say like almost two months and I'm writing it now but now I feel like rush to finish it to put something out there. I don't even feel like talking about it. Because it's like annoying me to talk about this and this is a tough thing about these like diaries or vlogs or whatever you call them. You really do have to face yourself to speak about anything your day or what's going on your mind or anything of value anyway. And sometimes I don't want to face myself. When trying to read, waiting for God by some own wheel, I'm not sure what was your last name. I've heard such good things about her. I have her other book right here. First and last notebooks but this one's a hard one to start just because she writes like pretty fragmented about like, I don't know if you can see this. Maybe the point is to not follow the thread so tightly. Like the thread of thoughts, maybe to allow the looseness of understanding, the looseness of following a thread, of someone else's thread. And just enjoying the abstractness, the vagueness, letting yourself fill in the pieces. Anyways, that's our map. We did it. We finished week two. I'm editing it now, which is a little meta. I don't know. I feel like that was longer than a week. I don't know. I try to get organized with this. See y'all next week.",well-being
"It's interesting when you experience an injury that others can't see, like a knee or ankle injury, because it's a lot harder for people to understand. Everyone is going through something, and success doesn’t shield you from depression. Kevin, you’re now the face of mental health in the NBA—how does that feel? At first, it was scary. I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression for a long time, and after having my first panic attack on November 5th, I didn’t even know what was happening. But now, looking back, I’ve changed my perspective. I really believe that everyone is going through something and that mental health doesn’t discriminate. I’m trying to change the stigma not just for athletes but for everyone. I remember my agent asking me if I was sure I wanted to speak out because people would talk about it, but I said, ""I’m doing this to help people."" Even helping one person can be life-changing. The panic attack was when the world got a glimpse of what was going on. That night was terrifying for me. I’ve always had anxiety, and sometimes I’d lay awake before a game, thinking about the worst things that had happened to me over the last decade. That night, everything built up—the anxiety, a rough start to the season—and I felt something I’d never felt before. During a timeout, I couldn’t catch my breath. I felt like my mind had left me. I told Ty Lue I’d be right back and ran to the locker room. I didn’t know what was happening, but I collapsed in the trainer’s room, feeling like my heart was going to explode and I couldn’t breathe. I honestly thought I was having a heart attack and that I was going to die. It was terrifying. But after I went to the hospital, everything checked out. I realized that it wasn’t something to suppress anymore. I started being honest with myself, and that freedom has given me peace. Sometimes things have to get worse before they get better, and hitting rock bottom made me realize that reaching out for help really works. For years, I suppressed my feelings because I thought that’s what I was supposed to do, especially as a man, but that’s misleading. I wish I had faced it earlier, but I believe everyone has their own moment when they’re ready to confront it. And what about LeBron during all this? He was incredibly supportive, and after the news came out, he gave me a reassuring pat on the back. Since then, others have come forward to share their own struggles, and that community has been incredibly valuable. Still, the stigma is strong, and some players will think you're soft for speaking up. But that attitude is outdated. Coming forward actually helped me, and it’s something that can help everyone, not just athletes. It’s a human issue, not just a sports issue.",well-being
"We're back with Kanye West. This is his album called ""Ye."" A beautiful photograph. You recorded this in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. You put out five other albums with other artists that you produced basically within, like, what, a month-long period of time. That's a ton of work. Are you like -- are you a workaholic? Are you always working? No, I actually slept a lot during the project. While they were recording? Yeah. I have a team, we worked together. I spent a year and a half after I got out of the hospital. I would go to Amoeba Record Store and start chopping up samples. It's very therapeutic because I wasn’t full Ye -- I don't know if I’m full Ye now, better or worse or whatever. But it was therapeutic just to listen to those songs and sample and go back to being 14 years old at my mom's house. By the time it's time to put the albums out, we have a whole team at Yeezy Sound that helps with the drums, lyrics, and choruses. I had to give like six or seven people ideas that I wanted on the song. And I'd just go to sleep and wait for them...Them working while you sleep, that's a hard worker right there. I feel like you avoided this album title. Oh, yeah, I don't -- ""I hate being bipolar, it's awesome."" I have a theory about you, tell me if this is correct. I feel you think being bipolar is part of what makes you brilliant, part of what makes you you, and you embrace it. Yeah, I think that’s another one of those things where people are like, how are you going to talk about it? The funny thing is, this is something that was on the internet before. It was kind of funny. But it’s not an opposite. It’s not ""I hate being bipolar. It’s awesome."" It actually drives more of how you really feel. It doesn’t do the opposite thing. I think it’s important for us to have conversations about mental health, especially with me being Black. We never had therapists in the Black community. We never approached taking medication. I think it's good that when I had my first complete blackout at age 5, my mom didn't fully medicate me, because I might have never been Ye. And there’s times where at least I’m happy that I know. Like, even for this interview, I knew I wanted to stay in an equal state. By the time I got to TMZ, I was ramped up. What was awesome is the world got to really experience someone in a ramped-up state. That’s when you get these comments that just shoot out, almost like Tourette’s. Because you have highs and lows. When you have a high, you’re on a roll. When you have a low, you’re not? Well, there are some cases of bipolar where people go low. I’m one that goes high. Like Michelle Obama said, go high. You don’t have extreme periods of depression? Oh, no. Because I just say it. I say it on real TV. Oh, I thought about killing myself. Then the thought is gone. So all people need to do is get on TV, that’s really the solution? They need to be able to express themselves without fear of judgment. What I love telling people is like, who do you know -- yeah, especially Black men. You know, I’m 41 years old. And I don’t know anyone, you know, that [bleep]ed up as much as I have that’s still as successful. I want to prove that you could get fat, you could say the wrong things, you can piss a whole [bleep] city off...and be president of the United States. Well -- yeah. Jimmy: There's one person. Kanye West, everybody.",well-being

"Welcome back. Well, earlier this week, NBA star Kevin Love revealed his struggle with panic attacks. As we were talking about it around the table, Carson, you shared your own experience with anxiety. Unexpectedly, too, inspired by the Kevin Love story. Something I can't change about myself. I've learned to embrace it. Hopefully, by just being honest and maybe opening up, it will inspire others to do the same. Looking back on my life, I was a worrywart kid. My father died when I was 5. I've been nervous my whole life. My first panic attack happened, and it happened when I was a host at MTV. Welcome to the show. ""Total Request Live."" The success of my career, I moved to New York and my life changed overnight. I had a hard time breathing. I was terrified for no apparent reason. At times, I feel like there's a saber-tooth tiger right here, and it's going to kill me, attack me, and bite my head off. I'm scared as if that's really happening. I went to the hospital. I have leads on my chest. I'm like, my heart is going to stop. You're perfectly fine. To this day, when I'm on television, if you watch ""The Voice"" live on NBC, watch on a Monday or Tuesday night, I'm never still. Same thing on ""Today"" Show, in the morning, some days I'm anxious. You see me. I'm fidgeting. High-pressure life. You know, on television. It has nothing to do with that. I had heightened anxiety and panic attacks at the playground with my children and wife there. And the feeling was so gripping, so terrifying, I had to leave and excuse myself. I did relaxing things, like ride my motorcycle across the country and had panic-stricken moments in that. This is the way I was born. This is the way I'm hardwired. This is the downside of the way God made me. And there's a tremendous upside, as well. I'm sensitive. I love music and music moves me in a visceral way. I get the chills when I hear certain music, like soul music. When I'm with my family and it's a euphoric moment, they resonate deeply with me. That's a flip side to a lot of that anxiety. I don't walk around a nervous wreck. I don't want people to watch this and think, ""Are you okay? Are you freaking out right now?"" No. I'm good. I'm good. People will watch this and say, ""How did he fix himself? What did he take?"" It's not that simple. What helped me was talking to a friend once, who said, ""Everything you're experiencing, I have, too."" You have anxiety. You should talk to somebody about it. Anxiety is a thing? I thought it was like stress. I opted for a cognitive therapist, someone who teaches you about anxiety, the model of it, and offers you tools on how to work through it. The muscle retention, relaxation really helps me. I'll do one now. This will help me. I'm nervous doing this interview. I'm going to clench my fists and my arm and my biceps as hard as I can, like I'm lifting a weight. Wow. That felt great. Like an ocean of relaxation. I really wear the way I am, like a badge of honor. This is who I am. And I'm proud of it. I may be a little anxious. But I know I'm going to be okay. We're so proud of you. You can hear my father talking in that. As it pertains to men's health and anxiety, that was my dad growing up. There's no such thing as stress or anxiety. As boys, we grow up like that. And anxiety and the doctor can talk about it, you feel like a little boy when you're uncomfortable having anxiety and you want your mommy, which is the antithesis of how you grew up. This is Tom. He's a licensed psychotherapist. I think Carson has done a brave thing. He comes on and does this job so well. It's also important because I think a lot of men do have that stigma. It really is. When you look at the statistics, like more women seek treatment than men. Okay. This is why you see a statistic when you hear women have more anxiety than men. That's not true. More women go and seek the treatment. The guy thing, as well. We have to push things under a rug, I'm a man. I'm having anxiety as we're talking. Literally, my heart rate is up. This is important. It's something that was great that you and people like Kevin Love can come out and say, this is relatively normal to some extent. How do you know if it's stress or if it's something more? If it's something you should speak to someone about? If it's really debilitating, and you can't sleep at night, you have a hard time functioning at work, and it's crippling you, that's the time to seek some help and have somebody to talk to. You get more women that come to my office. The men, it's a wife kicking them in. When they do, that becomes the highlight of their week. It's an outlet for them to unwind, to reframe their thinking, to understand their inner being. I think it's interesting what you said. You said, ""Does that mean I'm supposed to be on a drug? I don't want to be on drugs for the rest of my life."" You said the therapy makes a difference. I wanted to understand. If you want to fly and you're worried about it, learn about it. You're going to be nervous in the air, but you'll have a clearer understanding of how it works. Framework is everything, no matter — people are so afraid about what other people think of you. Yeah. I wish people could break down that wall, too. I guarantee you, everybody has something. Everybody. Everybody has something. It's how you deal with it. Interesting we're talking about this. I give a lot of lectures. I talk about self-esteem. What is the important word? Self. People are trying to extract attention from the outside world to fill themselves up. It doesn't work that way. We have to go within ourselves and unfold what lies deep. Wish I could open up a phone line and take all the calls. That's what the Orange Room is for. That's what people do, share. A lot of people shared with Carson, it makes a big difference. We want to put information on our website. I never knew there was a name...",well-being
" Okay, I'm calling this quick video because it's really nice why I'm right now. I'm actually gonna keep the video like this I'm feeling good at my energy. I kind of well, I'm feeling I'm just feeling fine like I guess that's the way I can put it I kind of I haven't been doing shit in my life because nothing's truly wrong like I'm not doing terrible But the issue is my mind right I keep on emitting myself to certain beliefs and thoughts of like I can't do this I can't do that and I've only created a whole freaking prison for myself like I don't want to be single from anymore like I know it's just not healthy whatsoever like it's not healthy to be in that like environment But I have nowhere else to go and kind of sucks because I don't know If there is anywhere else for me to go But I was thinking like as soon as I get some money soon I'm that she's gonna go to a different place like completely like not even where I'm like not even the city where I'm living Because I feel like that's anywhere and we able to change things like I don't see it as any other way um I've like things changing like actually changing after all So yeah, there's that and I kind of I don't know I know that I'm supposed to bring love to this world and bring light and like show my gifts But how am I supposed to show my gifts if I'm not being able to you know be seen or I'm like constantly You know, I wouldn't say hiding but like staying away my family's house and It's like You know at least with me last year when I was living in Wales Which was where I lived before coming back as a flambar I kind of definitely was Not really acting in my purpose, but I was still doing something that I love which is my job and You know Now being here. I kind of just got fed up and like right. This is stupid like I need to stop it so I was actually telling my mom because Have like a model of she coming up which I can still potentially go to as the London But I was actually saying to I was like listen, I might even just go to a different city because Saying here just isn't doing anything and it's not helping me and I know even if I was like You know taking that risk of being somewhere new completely At least I would get a possible chance of getting a job somewhere and Yeah, it's just I don't know because the only way I see it when me getting anywhere right now is if I got a proper job and saved up money to Move somewhere different, but anytime I've tried to get like a proper job where I live They've declined my offer. So it's like oh shit. What do I do like what can I do So yeah, there's just that and it's really frustrating, but I've always just let go and not be such and like a forcing energy and realize things happen for a reason but I'm definitely gonna try what's my phone's getting a bit wet while I'm recording this. I'm sorry I'm definitely gonna try and move somewhere different Very soon and even if it's like a big leap of faith that I have to take it's something that I will just have to take because I rather be someone you and get somewhere than be somewhere that's the same and get nowhere like It's just there's no growth. So yeah, but I think that's everything I want to say and",well-being
"When I was in the throes of my moments of depression, I didn't have confidence that I could do anything. I didn't think I could play the piano, I couldn't sing, I couldn't think critically, or make decisions like a lawyer should be able to do. And it was all, of course, imaginary because I always had those abilities; I just wasn't able to utilize them at the time. Anybody that you talked to here at Skyland Trail was pretty much familiar with your condition. It was a very personal atmosphere, and it felt good to have that support. I had had a few episodes of depression in my lifetime previously, and I had gotten treatment at several other facilities, but none of it had really been effective. But Skyland Trail’s approach was different. This particular type of therapy got me to the point where I was focusing on just living for the moment and being present for the moment, and I really think that had a lot to do with my getting well. Because now, I don't worry about the future. My plan at this point is to return to the full-time practice of law, but this time around I think I'm going to go at it a little bit differently. I'm interested in human rights, I'm interested in international law, and let me try to change and save the world that way.",well-being
" Hi guys welcome back to my channel, this is your seeing my face for the first time. My name is Tasnianic Hatsi here before. You already know we all work on back my regime. So guys today we are going to be talking on how to practice self reflection. Without further ado, let's get into the video. So guys before we get into the video properly, I would like to mention that self reflection is an opportunity for you to know your strengths, know your weakness, for you to know all that concerns you and helps you to be a better person. And I thought why not is the end of the year already as I speak it is November at this point and we have like basically few days, not really few days, we have basically like a month-long to end the year. It is a good time for you to self reflect on how your life has been throughout the year. So the first thing you want to do to self reflect is to ask yourself questions. What were the good, the bad, the ugly that happened to me this year was a really happy this year. I'm going to see if I can leave the questions that you can quickly ask yourself you know for you to self reflect about your life this year. All the good things that happened, all the bad things were going to get into that later on. How did I do this year? Does that focus on my goals? All the distractions I had this year, all the things that made me you know that killed myself. This is the end of the year, even the beginning of the next year, right? You have to self reflect is really, really, very important. You can't be winging your year, year, year, year, year, year, and at the end of the day, you can't even say okay, in 2024 I improved better as a person because I did this and this and that and that's why self reflection comes in. It helps you to know how far reminisce on the things that has happened in your life. Yeah. The next one is to write down the good and the bad. All the things that really made you happy this year. That's another question you have to access self. All the things that made you sad this year, all the things that you know that oh I did so much and I was so genuinely, genuinely happy you know about the happen to me this year that made me happy that made me you know in check with myself very, very important. All the other things that made me sad you know the things that it could be anything, it could be maybe you expected something and it didn't you know happen the way you know you wanted it to happen or maybe something whatever it could be maybe a loss or something is always very, very important sit down and write like I mentioned self reflection is also something that you do in a day is something that you can actually do for weeks right. So it's always very, very, very, very important to do that and where yourself reflect don't light yourself. I will say this you can't light to anybody in this world. For you see yourself don't like to yourself don't ever like to yourself. I remember once my mom was telling me you know the answer because you do three people sorry. The answer is if we don't like to you don't like to yourself you don't like to your doctor you don't like to your therapist like she mentioned those three things you never ever like never light yourself is very, very important. So genuinely write the things that made you happy and the things that made you sad. The next one is to write three major things that really made you sad. Now the basic or the importance of doing like a self reflection is to know your short comments and the things that actually you're not really happy about that happen this year. Yeah, because it's going to make you want to do better next year. It's going to make you want to be an improved person, a better person in the next year. That's why you have to self reflect. So you have to write down those things that really, really, really made you sad. That made you you know not motivated you know made you lazy, made you know concentrate on being a better self, made you know concentrate on your goals, made you not stand all the things that you said you were going to do coming into this year. So new year resolutions, I really don't believe in your resolutions but if you do what are the things that stops you from getting those resolutions is very, very important. And when you're only sitting there you have to buy it side, say the things that contributed to it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For example, let's say you were in a relationship and you, the relationship ended. Why did it end? Was it because the person wasn't a good person? Was it because you were in a good person? It's very, very important and it's very important for you to know that the good and the bad you have a contribution in it. Now if someone did you wrong for a very long time and at the end of the day maybe you broke up with the person or you left the person. Now where your own contribution comes in is the fact that you sat there for so long before you like picked up a like okay I'm not doing this anymore. That is your own contribution. It's always very important to always understand that it takes through to tango. It takes through to tango. So to know what it is, it could be that you lose guard, it could be that you know you dropped your self-esteem wasn't you know as high. It's not you don't beat yourself for the things that contributed for the things that didn't go on well. It's just for you not to do it again. Yeah. It's just for you not to do it again. So you have to be real with yourself. Sit down over the things that I did that contributed to me not focusing on my goal in 2024. Was I lazy? Was that passing a lot? Was I going out? Was I feeling all motivated? Was I feeling like oh I can't do this was in my self-esteem? You have to miss them. You have to know them. Very important. If you are not the right person, say to your head and answer yourself in your head. Very very key. Yeah. Next one is to think about the good things that happen and be grateful for them. Inasmuch as I said that reflection is so that you think about the bad things that happen to you. You know how to be better person. You also have to think about the good. Let me tell you something. Your life is not as bad as it seems. Yeah. The only reason why you think your life is bad or your life is not what you want it to be is because you complain yourself to another person or because you have a dream and you want that dream now, now, now. You don't want to go through the process. That's like the tree is. To think about the things that happen, one major thing I think we all take for granted is the fact that we clocked a year or that every year or all of us clocked a year or that this year is something that we do not read so much like clocked a year in good health. I remember one time. I was sick and it was my birthday. I can never, ever, ever forget that day. I can, I can not forget it. Now, it is not you know saying that okay, something bad has to happen to you before you. You'll be able to cherish that you get older. Forgetting older is a gift. We need to stop making a look at it. The battery is a gift. Some people pass the way very young. Some they will leave up to your age and some did your age and they've gone and you are working up to another year to live another to clock another age. So if you don't have anything to be grateful for, you'll be in a year older in good health. Very, very, very important. So think about the good things that happen. Be grateful for them. Very, very, very key. So these things is very, very important. Think about your family. Complete. You do have to go as I say over and you want to see it. Because that's on the other side. We need to start giving little things. That's very important. Then the last one is to set goals. Now this will help you and guide you to the next year. After reflecting, you're ready to know things that will, will, how you work to understand for it's goal well, those things that didn't go well, how you contribute it, please, for it not to go well. Now you need to set new goals for yourself for the next year. Like I said, you can't be a winging, be a like, a bison, you can't be doing that because honestly, what's your purpose of life if you're doing that? It's always very important. Set a goal for yourself. Very, very, very key. This is also going to help you not to go back into the pattern that you're trying to run away from. Like I said, way list the bad things, all the things that you contribute for that thing to actually be bad. And to make you know, go back to the thing where you set new goals. Oh, I want you to do this. I want to start a business. What is that thing that you have to do to start the business? You have to list it and do the work. You have to do the work. In case nobody's telling you, I'm telling you, you have to do the work. Nothing is going to happen without work. Nothing. Nothing is going to happen. If you want to start a business, if you want a nine to five, if you want to work from home, whatever it may be, if you do not put in the work, it is not going to happen. Like there's no how you want to do. There's no brainer. It's not going to happen. So you have to be meaning to put in the work and you have to tell yourself that you have to put in the work. Don't go into the air and just there. I know it can be so overwhelming. You know, new and new and new. Don't want to do now. Take your time. You might not start in January. Starts a February. You might not start a February start in March. I think before the first quarter is over. You already know what you want to do for the new year. Yeah. So guys, we've come to the end of this video. I hope you find this video helpful. Please send this video to someone that you feel my needed. Don't forget to keep the subscribe button. Give me a thumbs up. I'm really really really so happy to shake this. And I'll see you guys in my next video. Bye.",well-being
" Hello, so first of all I would like to introduce myself. I am Pachali Nata Wong or May. Today I am going to reflect upon my recently completed group project where we were supposed to work on a roleplay focused on negotiation and how to manage a conflict of interest. We did the presentation the other day and most parts turned out pretty good. Apart from the roleplay was mainly a discussion instead of negotiation. However, all of us did quite well, I would say. And we did try our best so I would like to share with you what I took from working with my team, the challenges we faced, and some new skills developed along the way. For benefits of collaboration, working with my team became quite insightful, I would say. I think one of the biggest advantages of collaboration was that I got to see things from different angles. Each person had a unique approach to negotiation and we were able to combine our different perspectives. It was kind of intriguing to see how each of us handled the conflict and then worked our way toward a solution that could benefit everyone. We had a good brainstorming sessions and I felt like we were constantly building on each other's ideas. Next for challenges encountered. Of course, everyone would encounter challenges. For us, we faced a few challenges along the way. One of the biggest problems I think it was scheduling with all of us having different commitments, such as final exams coming up soon, and a lot of work to do continuously. So it was hard to find time to meet. We had to overcome it by being flexible and trying to find ways to communicate effectively. There were also some instances where there was some conflict over our roles or how to approach certain parts of the negotiation. But I really think that helped us grow as a team. We learned to compromise and respect each other's ideas, ultimately strengthening our project. Next, new knowledge or skills gained. This project taught me a lot. Definitely, I improved my negotiation skills a bit, but also I learned some new strategies having looked at my teammates. Working through challenges together also taught me more about problem solving in a group setting. I realized that it is important to listen and support other people's ideas and become more adaptive in my approach to teamwork. For personal growth and teamwork, looking back now, I think the project helped me mature a bit. I really got to become a better team player and grew in appreciation of collaboration and mutual respect, especially when dealing with conflicts. Generally speaking, it was a good experience and I am much more confident about handling similar problems in the future. To conclude, I am very thankful. Thank you for listening to my reflection. This project was a great learning experience both in building teamwork and acquiring confidence in the management of conflict situations. Through working with my team, I learned how important, clear communication, patience and respect for other people's perspectives are. I look forward to applying what I have learned in other group settings and projects. Thanks again for watching. Bye bye.",well-being
I am Vivian Smith I've worked at the University of Strathclyde in the Department of Education and I'm really interested in literacy and how the messages we give children about reading from the very beginning influence the way they develop as readers if we get early reading right there will be more children who are prepared to read and do well in school all sorts of wonderful things happen if you read your vocabulary increases your ability to use language increases your range of ideas increases or general knowledge increases all of that is important another thing that reading will be silly though if not just increase your ability to learn the effect could increase your mental well-being one of the things we all know that reading does for us is it gives us a space away from the real world and that's important children feel experiencing stress for every room can use reading of that breakout space that we break where they don't have to worry about whatever it is that growing if you think about a fairy tale where magic might happen or up which is a which might appear or a giant or a wicked stepmother the child who reads those know that that isn't real but it gives them another way of looking at life and if you can say okay that world is not quite like my world you can then say well what if my world was different so if reading is presenting an alternative way of seeing reality a suggestion there might be other ways of doing another thing that's important is that reading helps children understand their own life and there are lots of lovely picture books about real children who have real emotional crises and I don't really think it might be just realizing that another girl in your class has the same dress on you but actually reading and seeing that other people have the same emotions of you the same experiences you it's very important for children very important for everyone because it makes you understand you're not alone in the world even more incessant breathing teaches you empathy so you don't just see your own world you see something else's and you learn that other people have other ways of thinking other problems other ways of dealing with them and we need that the new children to be able to see the world from other people's perspective [Music] ,well-being
[Music] i think initially it was quite a difficult time because i'd started my teacher training which anyone who's done that knows how difficult that is um you don't really have much time for yourself you've gone from not planning not working weekends to working 60 70 hour weeks it wasn't a gradual process just kind of i woke up one day and just like don't feel like it today and the things i used to enjoy just kind of stopped went to the doctor and got diagnosed within probably like 10 minutes with the suicidal thoughts i did have it when i was at school probably at 13 14. and then it did kind of gradually get worse in seven 20 17 18 that kind of time luckily i kind of taught myself out of it and didn't actually go through with it [Music] you know all of us were addicted to his phones and role on social media quite a lot i'm just looking through and on the bit that says by the people you may know or suggestions that might never matter came up i was like oh the quick few few mutual friends then one of the posts was that they were doing weekly football sessions just for anybody so i just thought i'll come down well i'll message see what it's like and then come down and go from there if it's good it's good if it's not it's not not really lost anything and it's probably one of the better decisions i've made in the last two or three years to be fair coming down it's almost what we do away from the football that's probably as important and probably if not more important like we're all we're friends viewers meet up a couple times a week now just start a dream have a chat and it gives you that outlet gives you that clearer head space where you you're focusing on something else when you're in football when you run you know when you're at the gym you're focusing on that you're not focusing on i don't feel very good today i don't want to get through the day or i can't get through the day or that kind of thing i think i'm in a much better place much better place to deal with things in life in sport i'm back playing back a part of a group that i think appreciates me just overall much much better than i was three or four years ago ,well-being
hi my name is Marissa Robinson and I'm a psychotherapist and today I want to talk to you about spiritual Wellness so I first want to start with some definitions because I think I didn't know what spiritual Wellness was before before learning more about it so when I think about spiritual Wellness I think of a higher sense of purpose meaning value in your life meeting your own needs exploring and feeling connected to your authentic self and the world around you also participating in activities that are consistent with your beliefs and your values we'll go more into all of that a myth about spiritual Wellness is that we need religion in order to be spiritual so I think when I think about religion I think about it as a support to your spiritual Wellness so after we've taken time to explore our spiritual Wellness to look inwards and kind of explore what our meaning in life is meeting our own needs what those needs are our values and beliefs we are able to see where we rely align maybe a religion really expresses these values and beliefs in a way that feel true to you and so joining that religious house or religion can help you feel more supported in the community but you certainly don't have to be religious in order to be spiritual in fact I believe that my spirituality is more about me is more about connecting to who I am and living in a way that feels authentic to me that doesn't mean I'm not religious but that doesn't but in my mind spiritual Wellness is more about me being connected to me me being connected to people around me that um align with my beliefs values and meanings and that I also am connected to the outside world and world around me so how does spiritual Wellness relate to your mental health when I think about it I think about the word authenticity I think we heard a lot about that in my definition of spiritual Wellness when I think about spiritual illness I think about meeting your own needs feeling um noticing what your needs are and being able to express your authentic self in a way that lives that you live in a true and honest way so when I think about spiritual Wellness I think about honing into your authentic self um also spiritual Wellness can decrease your Stress and Anxiety one way that you can kind of live in a spiritual way is by meditating by having quiet time by embracing the silence and Solitude and that can be a decrease in your stress and anxiety in turn it can increase your self-esteem and confidence because you're embracing this authenticity you're living in a way that is true to you and in that it feels like you're capable you're confident you don't need to rely on anyone else or compare yourself you're kind of on your own path and that is how it can increase your self-esteem and confidence another way is I think I mentioned this in the definition is that you feel connected with the relationship with yourself you feel like you have positive and healthy relationships with others and have a positive relationship with the world around you in your environment often when we are living in an authentic way we probably aren't engaging in relationships that feel toxic or not right or hurtful to us we're normally engaging in relationships that be all really good and healthy to us as well as feel like our space is clean that we live in a space that feels good and calm for us so that can be some things that you normally find when you're embracing yourself your spiritual Wellness as well there's also a sense of acceptance you accept yourself and those around you and it's not once again that comparing or living in societal Norms you're really connecting to yourself and living a way that feels true to you so with that how do we improve our spiritual Wellness I'm going to give you an example when I feel the most connected to myself um and I'm embracing my spiritual Wellness I normally feel a sense of grounded connection and feel like the fullest version of myself and I started to wonder and I want you to do the same of when you do feel that sense of connection groundedness and feel full when I feel that way I think about my running path back home and I think about when it is just a flat Road ingrained in nature and it just kind of goes and I'm jogging and normally I listen to music when I jog but here I don't I just listen to the nature sounds I notice my emotions I allow myself just to explore what myself my authentic self is saying what I need any beliefs and values I have what it feels like to be in this authentic space and then I start to notice one other one what other ways I feel like that when I like I do when I'm running and I start to notice when I'm with this friend I feel this way when I'm by myself meditating I feel this way when I'm in the therapy room I feel this way and then you can kind of pick out when you're really feeling authentic so that's a way that I explore my spiritual Wellness is when I feel my most grounded connected and fullest and then it gives you permission to explore your personal values and your higher purpose in life I want us to dedicate a quiet time where you feel like you can be your most grounded fullest version of yourself so that you can explore these questions too I know that feels a little daunting but most of the time when you are grounded and feeling good and that you can just be with you is times where you might find those answers and surprise yourself so I want you to dedicate it's quiet time and create a routine of this this can be a minute this can be an hour this can be 10 minutes within your day it doesn't have to look any certain way it just feels right it feels true and most times you would have to embrace the silence and Solitude just because you're alone does not mean that you're lonely it means that you're actually just allowing yourself to be with you so you can ask yourself these questions so I want that's some ways to improve your mental and um how it relates to your mental health and how you can improve your spiritual Wellness so before Beyond I want us just to take a time take a moment to kind of embrace that silence and Solitude most often um when I'm just practicing this in my daily routine and even if it's just for a minute in between therapy sessions I could take a moment to close my eyes I put one hand on my heart one hand on my belly and take a breath so I'm going to invite you to do this with me now let's just take a moment and breathe in through our nose exhale out through her mouth and I want you to repeat that just a few times and check in with your body reconnect with your authentic self and ask yourself these questions about your spiritual health uh thank you so much for joining me today and learning more about spiritual Wellness

"Hello guys, I just got back from my Japan trip with Pokey, Aran, and Hun, and this is the first trip I've taken in literally years that was an actual vacation, so I didn't vlog a ton of it but I still documented a good amount of it so that I could show you guys and also be able to look back on it; it was a lot of fun, we traveled around the country, ate a ton of really, really good food, and overall it was just nice spending time with a group of girls and getting outside and meeting people, which maybe wouldn't be what you would expect me to say but even I need a little bit of that every once in a while, so also I got to go to the Kirby Café, which I didn't expect—it was literally like a night-before thing, Ren got some tickets from a Chinese scalper guy I guess, so yeah that was really cool too, and yeah I filmed that, enjoy; it’s so good, it’s so good; Puffy Puffy, first breakfast in Japan—pancakes, Pammy cheese fries, I kind of just want the pancakes, pancakes and French fries; we stopped, cameras, yes now we can be in our own vlog, exactly, which makes sense, so there’s like little couches everywhere, so cute, it’s so cute, oh we got a private room, cute, so cute, what do you think?

"What's going on guys, thanks so much for watching my Meishan video, and this is gonna be kind of the part of the video where I go into exactly how I did it, and this video is really gonna be aimed for the people who have been trying to take off the weight and just haven’t been able to do it and feel like failures because of it, thinking it's their fault or their willpower that can't get them this, and I’m just an average guy, I’m a junior in college, not a D1 athlete or scholar, just a normal guy who figured out how to make it happen after years of failure, so I’ll go into some main details on how I was able to do it; first thing is diet—when it comes to diet, the only numerical term I want to mention is being in a calorie deficit; you’ve got a point where you’re gonna maintain, put on weight, or lose weight if you're under that maintenance level, it’s that simple, I’m not gonna talk about macros, keeping it realistic here, you’ve got to be in a deficit, that’s all, whether large or small, you’re gonna lose weight just might be faster or slower depending on how aggressive the deficit is, but you’ve got to sustain it; eat what you enjoy, I ate what I liked the entire time, no need for diets, they set you up for failure, cheat meals are just a socially acceptable way of binging; if your friends are having pizza, have a slice, it’s okay, but remember to go right back to your routine, have the choice to say it’s more important to stick to your plan, and make sure you’re in a deficit, track it using MyFitnessPal or whatever works for you; next point is exercise, for me, almost all of it was cardio because I was so focused on weight loss, I wasn’t concerned with weightlifting at the time, but I got back into it later; during weight loss, I focused on cardio and circuit training, doing what I enjoyed, like swimming and the Stairmaster, not running, don’t make cardio a punishment, make it something you enjoy, put on a great album, watch your favorite show; my personal cardio regimen now is 45 minutes a day of either Stairmaster or swimming or circuit training, that’s what keeps me lean and happy; to wrap this up, the key points that made this weight loss transformation successful were: 1) What is your why? Establish why you want to lose weight and make it important enough to get up early or do what it takes; 2) Set small goals to stay focused and accountable, hitting short-term goals builds momentum toward the long-term goal; 3) Trust the process, once you know what you need to do and stick to it, trust it will work; 4) This is not a diet, it’s a lifestyle change, make it something you enjoy so it becomes a habit; 5) No black-and-white thinking—don’t strive for perfection, allow yourself breaks when needed, just stay on track the next day; thanks for watching, smash that like and subscribe button, and share with your friends if you got something out of this, more content coming soon, until then, keep grinding.",well-being
"Over the past two and a half years, I’ve spent 2,000 hours meditating in an effort to master my inner world and overcome anxiety, so in this sort of journal entry of a video, I invite you to sit back and relax while I sort of recap my experience of meditating and get a sense of what I’ve learned through this life-transforming process; spoiler alert: it is not what you would expect. To tell this story so far, let’s go back to 2019—I was working as a cardiac technician, fresh out of university, having graduated with a biomedical science degree; I was training at the gym, looked my best, had a beautiful girlfriend, so on the surface everything was going well, but under the hood, not so much. I was dealing with tremendous amounts of anxiety, playing video games upwards of 10 hours per day to mask that underlying discomfort; I would socially isolate myself and feel exhausted after work, so while things looked good externally, internally it was a completely different story. Enter Tim Ferriss and Sam Harris, whose insights led me to try meditation; starting with five-minute bursts, I found a sort of relief I hadn’t experienced before, fueled by internal investigation rather than numbing discomfort with external solutions. It felt like an operation on my mind, uncovering self-limiting beliefs that had been unconsciously driving my reactions and suffering. Motivated by this clarity, I increased to 20-30 minutes of meditation per day, despite moments of frustration, because the relief from anxiety was undeniable. This led me to my first 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat, where I learned body scanning and began deconstructing deeply held thought patterns, seeing sensations as transient and gaining objectivity. This clarity brought immense relief from suffering and motivated me to adopt two hours of daily practice, aiming to uproot suffering permanently. With consistent practice, I noticed improvements in daily life, becoming more present and detached from difficult mental states while appreciating small moments. However, meditation also brought challenges; deep practice surfaced repressed memories and traumas, forcing me to confront difficult material that, at times, overwhelmed me. Meditation, when taken seriously, is not about bliss but rigorous self-investigation that can feel like shredding old beliefs, which sometimes felt destabilizing. While meditation offered liberating insights and glimpses of freedom, it also required balancing engagement with the world and laying a healthy psychological foundation. Today, meditation remains my top priority; supported by a teacher and consistent practice, it permeates every moment, transforming my perspective and making it clear that I have everything I need within me and that I’m completely okay.",well-being
" So I'm creating this video because I was just crying. Okay, I was just crying and practically screaming on the top of my lungs saying that I hate my life. I hate the position I'm in. I'm tired of feeling like my energy is not appreciated. I'm tired of feeling like I'm putting my all into everything I do practically. Everything I do I put my all into and you know it might not be the outcome that's expected or the outcome that some people might want. But I believe the effort is everything. If someone is not putting in the same effort as you, then that's where shit gets a little messy because everyone wants to be appreciated. Everyone wants to feel like they're doing something right. There's no like, there's no right or wrong way to do things. I don't know who, what upper power there is to tell us and reassure us that we're doing everything the way we're supposed to. It's all in our heads, you know, we put pressure on ourselves to feel like we're doing things right. There's a lot of distracting stories out there that make you feel like you need to be doing better or you know that you're just not on the same par or page as other people. We all grow up in different ways. We all grow up differently. So I believe it's really just unlearning what you've been conditioned to learn and what you're conditioned to being used to. So me saying that I hate my life is just me saying that I'm done with being who I am. I'm done with my lifestyle and my way of thinking. You know, I'm not, I do create excuses. I'm not going to say I never create excuses, but I don't think I create the most excuses from what I've experienced. I've experienced people that have way more excuses in their life and they let that dictate their decisions. And I really, I really try not to make excuses, but at this point in my life, you know, it's part of, it's part of my lifestyle and I don't want it to be anymore. Not only with myself, but with other people. So it takes acknowledgement. It takes reassuring yourself because if you depend on reassurance from other people, it's just not going to, it's not going to hit you as deep. It's not going to resonate with you. It has to be with yourself. It has to be within yourself in order for you to get hit by other waves. The ocean inside of you needs to be managed in calm. You need to manage your own waves in order for you to be able to witness any other waves in your life and actually be able to navigate them and go about life without setting yourself back or feeling left like this. I feel very, very upset. I'm very upset. I just stopped crying and I'm like, well, what can I do? I can talk to myself. I can sit here and talk my way out of it because I don't know what else to do. It's, it's a very lonely world out there. We're all disconnected and even the connections you have with maybe your friends or boyfriend, girlfriend, whoever it is that you are connected to, even that connection might not feel as connected as you want it to be because we're all disconnected. They want us all to be disconnected from our families, from our significant others, our children. The only thing we're really connected to is our phones and it's so sad to feel like I hate my life and I don't. I'm so grateful for my life. I'm so grateful for waking up and being able to do whatever I want to do. I'm thankful for breathing. I'm thankful for being able to create this video in general. But it's sad for me to say that I do hate my life because I don't and I want to access that part of my brain that feels that way. It's so hard to manage my waves. My waves are not calm right now and that's okay because I acknowledge it and I want it to pass. I want these waves to pass and I want to calm myself in order to navigate the world. I have to navigate myself and I'm choosing to talk because talking just lets it out to me and helps me acknowledge it. So if anyone else is feeling this way, I really hope that you can put it in yourself and not put it out into the world because it's not the world's fault. The world is just going along without you. Time will continue with or without you. So everything you feel is internal. It's your internal thoughts. It's the waves inside of you and if you can't control that, then the world will get you. It will make you feel like you hate your life because you're not focused on your waves. You're focused on all the other waves coming at you and that's a very dangerous way of thinking because you might drown. You might actually drown. You might actually let it take you because you're weak inside and you won't let yourself come out. So that's it. That's all I got to say. I hope this can help other people. I get to help to meet a little bit. It takes a little more than just talking at this point because it takes action and it takes accountability in myself and that's what I plan on doing for the rest of my life. It is an ongoing and everlasting commitment but I don't want to happen. You regret it my life. So that's that.",well-being
" So, basically my whole entire life, aside from elementary school, I've never had friends. In elementary school, I had a few friends, but after that, I literally never had friends. I've never had a group of friends that I hung out with. Consistently, I don't have friends that I call or text or hang out with. I have acquaintances that I see at school and work and now in college, but I do not have any friends. And when I say this or when I have had to say this, people usually laugh. And I think it's either A, because they think it's a funny joke that I've made, or be they're uncomfortable by the thought of that. Saying that you don't have friends has become a joke. It's like the butt of the joke. Oh, I don't have friends home. The jellies are here, I don't need. But when I say I don't have friends, I mean I genuinely do not have one single friend that I can call up and hang out with and just do friend things with. Like I don't have friends, I've never had friends. Now that we get that out of the way, I don't appreciate the stigma around not having friends. You know, I feel like, well, first of all, we're taught to be social. We live in a society that rewards, extroverts. It rewards people who are extremely social and outgoing. And I am none of those things. I am extremely introverted. And growing up, I thought there was actually something wrong with me. I felt bad about myself because I didn't understand why I couldn't go socialize like everyone else did because I just had this feeling of absolute drain and exhaustion anytime that I tried and I just didn't understand why that happened to me. But over the years and especially within the past two years or so, I've really come to understand why I am this way. And I think it's important if you don't have any friends to understand why you are the way you are. For me, I am not shy. I don't have social anxiety. I don't have any sort of fear of people or talking to people. I am just very, very, very introverted. And I find peace in being alone. It's when I feel the most energized and the most like myself. I need to be alone in order to function properly. And even going out for a night can just exhaust the absolute shit out of me. And I've learned that. I've learned that there is nothing wrong with me and that this is truly just the way that I am. And I'm at a point where I'm able to embrace that now. And I love being alone more than anything. So A, try your best to figure out why that is the case. Because there's a difference between not having friends and, you know, keeping it that way because you're happiest and not having friends because of something like social anxiety or, you know, just general fears. It can be unhealthy, but it doesn't have to be. And in my case, it's definitely not unhealthy. But yeah, I think that not having friends needs to be normalized. If you don't have any friends like me, don't feel bad. It's easier said than done. But there's truly nothing wrong with it. Again, we do live in a society that rewards people for their extraversion and... This dude's just absolutely blasting my music through the gym parking lot. I'm sorry, but... Oh, I got off track. Alright, basically, if you don't have friends, take it from me. I have literally not had friends practically my entire 19 years of living for the most part. And I am introverted. I know myself very well and I am happy and you don't need friends to be happy. If that is something that makes you happy, if you find joy and you gain energy from those social interactions and parties and small talk and just gathering together with people, like you do it, do you? But this video is just for people who don't have any friends. Because I wish I had someone to tell me when I was younger, hey, there is literally nothing wrong with you. You are just not an extrovert and you enjoy being alone. It was like it was so hard for me to look around and just see everyone else having friends, you know, at school, all that. And then me being the kid alone, thinking, wow, no one likes me, there is something wrong with me, blah, blah, blah. But I was super young, I mean. What do you expect? But now that I know myself much better, I know that there is certainly nothing wrong with me and there is nothing wrong with you either. You are perfect the way you are. And if it is something deeper, I guess, if it is like social anxiety or you have fears of being rejected or, you know, if you want friends and don't have them, those are always things that you can find support for and work on and change and get better. But if you don't have friends and you are okay with it, you are not alone and I just want to remind you that there is nothing wrong with you, be you. And you know, I would say that all of us with no friends could like come be friends. But I think I'm good, you know what I mean? I think I'm showing, but yeah, that's all I have to say. Just a rant about being a friendless human. Yeah. I like to stay busy and I like to work on myself and I really, really, really enjoy quiet, just piece silence. And that makes me happy, so. Yeah. Don't worry. Don't worry about it.",well-being
" Hey guys, I hope everyone's doing well. Today's video is about male loneliness. In advance, I want to apologize about the shinginess of the camera. And guys, today's video is like I mentioned about loneliness. It's hard because you go around people, you follow the advice of you just got to go out there and make friends and approach people. And you notice that a lot of the people, you know, they make you feel unwelcomed, you know, their body language says it, their behavior says it. And as men we're seen as predators as bad guys, just because a small number of ended it. But you know, you say anything could be said about the small number of women, the small number of whatever group you mention can be said as well that there's, you know, small, you know, percentage doing bad stuff. But it's tough and it's memorializing once you deal with that stuff, you don't want to approach people anymore. And one of the things I found out is that you could live with that thought, but in the end, you can't wallow in your own negativity and your own thoughts that are just going to harm you. And one of the things I've noticed that helps me is help people unconditionally. Don't help people with expecting something in their turn. You know, after a while, you're going to start seeing how these people, you know, they're seeing how dependable you are, how great you are at helping them. And that gets you out of the rut, believe it or not, in time. You know, you start seeing how other people treasure the things you do for them. And you slowly get out of there. It does take time. But one of the things you want to go ahead and just keep in mind is that I think there's more good people, more people that are rational and irrational that, you know, think, oh my gosh, it's, you know, sometimes I feel like a bear. Like, oh my gosh, it's a bear. You know, I feel like if people see me as a bear because, you know, they think I'm going to, you know, eliminate them. And that's not true. That's not, that's, you know, and sometimes you feel like, I'm like, man, am I a bear? That people just don't want to be around me, you know, and it's, and it's exhausting, you know? And once you deal with that enough, you don't want to deal with it anymore. And then you just isolate yourself. And, but you hear yourself in, in the end, I mean, just with your thoughts, those things are just destructive of the negativity that you think. So what I do is I just say, you know what, the opinion that matters is my opinion. And nobody else's, you know, at the end of the day, who's a pinion do you want? Do you want to go by somebody that you're not, that's never going to like you or even your own negativity that's always going to be going against you? Why not just live by your own self-asset, you got to build up your self-esteem. That way you could defend yourself when all these negative awful thoughts just come in through your head. And that's all you can do. Just live day by day. But I want to go and just keep it short, guys. Take it easy.",well-being
" Hey guys, how's it going? Guys, thank you so much for all your time, your comments. I really appreciate it guys. I'm really made of motivates me to do these videos. Thank you guys today's topic I want to cover failure. So failure, we love what ourselves goals, we didn't accomplish something, we feel bummed out, we feel all these negative emotions and we say, you know, I'm never going to accomplish anything. If I can't even accomplish this, I said by age 25, I'm going to be here, but I'm not. And you say, look at this person, they're already there. You know, I'm not here and they're, and we're at the same age, we started off at the same point. And the truth is, you're going to hurt yourself just comparing yourself to others. So that's not the, so that is a bad thing to do to yourself. The thing is, you know, we all have advantages and disadvantages and there's certain circumstances in life that just didn't permit us to go forward. And the thing is, you know, there's no, you shouldn't set yourself in timeline necessarily. Perhaps the goal is it going to take you a while? Yes. But you shouldn't be really bumming yourself out over small failures. You know, failure is going to happen no matter what. Even the successful people that you're seeing, they failed. They're going to fail until you succeed. That's the truth. And the thing is that, that you got to start off with small goals. You got to, sure, there's a big picture, right? But you got to say, okay, I'm going to need to start off here, here, here, here, here. For example, you know, I was watching this guy called Healthy Gamer, Dr. K. Great video. I'm going to put it on the link below. So guys, I want to go ahead and say that he says start off with small goals. So you want to eat healthy? That's the goal. So he said, you know, maybe you said, I'm going to eat healthy three times a day, but you could only eat one. And you bum yourself out. I think I might be off a little bit on what he said in the video, but he said that start off small just once, eat healthy for one day a week. Then after a while, you're going to say, hey, I'm eating I ate three times, I ate three days healthy this week. Let's go ahead and shoot for three in next week. He said, no, scale it back a little bit. It's hard. Put yourself at two for next week. And then after a while, it's going to get easier and easier and easier. And then you're going to, in your mind, it's going to start saying, hey, look, I'm accomplishing these goals. You know, and after a while, you're going to start seeing, you know, an avalanche of successes. And the same thing applies not just for healthy eating, but other goals, you know, financial and maybe in school. You know, for example, I knew a guy that got his engineering degree and he started off in pre-algebra and community college and little by little, he put effort and sure, it took him, I think like four or five years just to get to differential, calculus. So the thing is, it's true. It's going to take you a while to get to a certain point. But the truth is, you got to start off small until you start seeing the bigger successes. So don't bum yourself out, don't compare yourself. You know, be your own cheerleader. Be your own nurture. So guys, I want to go ahead and keep it there. I'll see you in the next video. Take care.",well-being
" It is November 4th, 2024, and I'm 24 years old. Being 24 is kind of weird. On one side, I have these middle-aged Korean guys telling me that I'm so young and that I have time. And on the other side, I have my Sunday school, high school students calling me a nunk already. In the middle, people my age well, we're all over the place. Some people are graduating and getting adult jobs, some are getting engaged. Two months ago, I went to my first wedding where somebody two years younger than me was getting married and that was kind of trippy. And then there's other people that are still hanging on to those last drops of the early 20s. Still posting stories on staff chat of all places. I like to ask old people what age they would like to return to. To my surprise, none of them said that it was their 20s. Most of them said that it was their 30s. They said it's because their 20s was filled with too much uncertainty. And I think that's pretty accurate. I think I've made about 100 different life plans. Plans like, oh, I'm definitely going to marry this person or this person is definitely going to be a lifelong friend or... I'm going to be living here in two years or I'm going to be doing this with my business in one year, etc. And just about 100% of those things have not gone according to plan. There's this Bible verse that I've been reflecting on. It's James chapter 4, verse 13 to 15. It reads, Come now you who say, today or tomorrow, we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there doing business and making money. Yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, if the Lord wishes, we will live and do this or that. That's humbling. Who in mind to say that I'm going to be doing this and that, definitely? But it's also encouraging knowing that there's a God out there that has plans that are beyond me. So I'm making this video kind of like a time capsule. That at 24 years old, so far, nothing has gone according to plan. But that right now, I'm excited and that I trust God's plan. What amazing plan does he have for me that he's throwing all of my plans out the window for? And I pray that God helps me and you find certainty through our uncertainty. Amen.",well-being
" It's okay to not be okay. You over here, you hate people say, is everything gonna be okay? Am I gonna be okay? Are you gonna be okay? Are they gonna be okay? The answer is no. I'm not gonna be okay. You're not gonna be okay. Everything is not gonna be okay. But that's okay. The way I look at it is how you look at things, how you perceive things, how you look at life in the current situation that you're in or situations. I look at things as either a lesson or a blessing. If someone talks badly behind my back or just talks badly about me or backstabs me in any type of way, am I gonna feel okay about it? No. I'm not gonna feel okay. But that's fine though. Obviously that person wasn't meant to bring me up in life and I'm obviously not gonna let them bring me down. Therefore, I'm gonna use them as a lesson to help me keep moving forward in my life. So they don't affect me. Don't focus on the bad things or the pessimistic things. Don't surround yourself with negative thoughts and emotions after you have gone through something like this. Because life is moving on. And if you don't move on with life it's gonna move on without you. And that's gonna set you back a ton before you even know it. And another thing about life is it's not meant to be okay. You're meant to have those. If you didn't have lows, then you wouldn't have highs. There's gonna be times where you're gonna feel like nothing's gonna change. Your life is just gonna get worse. There's not gonna be any ways for you to heal. But when you feel that type of way, when you are feeling that way, you have to learn to appreciate the lows so you can enjoy the highs. Learn to enjoy the highs that you've had and will have. For example, if you sick and you've had, you've got a stuffy nose and a headache, you sit in there, sitting there thinking, damn, like I wish I was outside right now breathing in that fresh air plant bowl outside on my street. But I bet you, when you wasn't sick, you didn't even think about that fresh air. You didn't think about the bowl on the street like you were about to play, like you didn't think about any of that. When you are at your highest, you have nothing to do with those lows. You don't even think about the lows. When you're at your lowest, all you think about is the highs. Learn to appreciate the lows so you can enjoy the highs. Without being at your lowest, you won't have a high. Without being at your highest, you won't have a low. I've learned so many things from being at my lowest and the best things that have happened to me in my life were from being at my lowest. I've lost this many fake friends from while I was at my lowest. But I gained positivity and energy that I can maintain to get to my highest. I lost all these people, but obviously, if I lost them, they weren't meant to bring me up. They weren't meant to keep me going. And now, all of a sudden, I'm at my highest. Now, these things may not correlate to you in any type of way, or anything like that. But now, I'm here to tell you that life is going to get better. But life is also going to get worse. What is, what value does life have if you just stand on one level the entire time? Life is just going to go up. You're going to be at your highest and eventually, you're just going to go right back down. Life is going to be amazing. Then you're going to be at your lowest again right before you know it. If everything in life was good and sweet, there wouldn't be no appreciation. But if everything was bad, there wouldn't be no enjoyment. You have to find that balance and appreciate the lowest so you can enjoy the highs. So when either of them hits you in the face, you aren't overwhelmed with it and you're able to maintain it. And make good things out of it. So at the end of the day, it's okay not to be okay. Life is going to get better. Life is just going to get worse. But then it's going to get better again. Then it's going to get worse again, like a rollercoaster. In the end, it's how you look at those things. It's how you look at the bad things and the good things, and how you deal with them, and how you let them affect you and help you move forward until where you want to be next. Remember, there is no purpose in life if you were just up here the whole time. Those lows mean something, just like those highs mean something. Learn from those lows and appreciate them so you can enjoy the highs even more. Now I appreciate you after listening and if you're still here, thank you for still being here. I'll see you on the next one.",well-being
"Now this next part says, I have been feeling and it says, draw the different feelings you've had and write them out below. Wow. During this time where we stay home and we be with our families, I have felt so many different things. And maybe you read my little video about wild feelings last week, but some of the things I've been feeling are happy. I love staying home with my family. I love having extra time with Jayny and getting to see her learn and help her and kind of learn what she does at school. That's been really fun. So happy. I have felt really sad because I really miss my kindergartners. And I wish I could see them and I wish that I could teach like normal because I don't really like talking to myself in front of my computer because nobody talks back to me and it's kind of boring and it makes me sad. So I'm gonna draw a sad face. Okay, I have felt tired. Okay, I'll draw sleeping. Okay. So I've got myself sleepy. I don't know if you guys have felt sleepy, but sometimes I just feel like I don't have that much energy like I usually do. And then let's see here. I have felt crazy. So I'm just gonna make myself like looking crazy. Like wild crazy like ah. First crazy. And then I have felt mad. Sometimes it's really frustrating and angry when I'm trying to do work and there's all of my family running around my house. It's really hard right now and all by myself. So, yeah, sometimes I do feel mad. But right now I feel pretty happy. So anyways, you can see here that I have felt a lot of different feelings. Okay, hopefully you guys have felt a lot of different feelings too and like this is normal. SJanie has been writing her bike with training wheels. She really wants to turn the wheels off, but she's a little bit slow on the wheels right now. So anyways, she's upstairs. But she's gotten so much more confident at writing her bike and she's happy and she's excited. She used to be a little bit afraid. So it's been really cool to see her grow as a bike rider. So that is one magical moment that I got to experience with Janie one day and it was during lunch. So usually at lunch I don't get to go bike writing with Janie. So on this particular day, we took our lunch outside and we ate it by outside on our deck. And then we went for a bike ride. So here she is, she's on her bike and her tricycle, well, not tricycle, bike with training wheels on it.So that is my magical moment and I'm gonna label this watching Janie grow, her cadence on her bike. That's been really fun. So if you don't have a page like this at home, you can just simply at the top write one word that inspires you. I'm gonna get this marker. I have code one word that inspires you. You can draw five different circles and add almost like an emoji, what you've been feeling. And then a magical moment that's happened to you recently. And then right here it says time stamp, make an inspirational message and put it in a neighbor's mailbox. It would be really fun to do. I think I'm gonna write a message to my neighbor that says, be happy, go outside and enjoy the fresh air or something like that. So anyways, that's it for today friends. I hope you have a great day and happy Wednesday. Bye.",well-being
" What is up friends? This is so weird. I'm finally doing this video and it's a sit-down video. We're gonna do something exciting. I feel like I need to sit on something. I'm gonna get my panton flash. You think that gave me a little boost? I'm gonna sit on this box. Nothing. Alright. I am... Oh! Hold on. Let me get a stu-in-set. Okay. Alright. That's a little bit. So I am wearing pages right now because I have a little bit, but I'm going to in a little bit. It is a 18th of December, currently, to 21. I just got back from a business training and it was really good. But now it's time. So I'm gonna open my letter and I'm really nervous. A little rundown December 18 last year. I believe it was a Friday. I was going through a lot. It was about to be Christmas and yeah, I was going through a very hard time in my life. My boyfriend at the time, like, broke up with me and I really like... It was just a messy breakup. It was very heartbreaking. I wrote this letter to myself, to my future self, so that I could see how far I've come. Not only that, but I kind of explained in my other video on Instagram that this is like a little prayer. Just me writing down. Kind of like what's going on in my life and like what I want to see, where I want to see myself in a year. I actually wrote a letter to myself in seventh grade and my teacher milled it back to me. Right when I graduated, I received it in the mill around like August time, I believe. I got to open it and read it and see who I wanted to be at that time. Me a year ago is completely different than me today. I'm very thankful for the growth because it was super hard to go through that. I'm just going to read it. I'm going to talk at the end. Yeah. I'll probably cut out some parts that are like if it's too much or it's going to like expose or do whatever company's need. Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous. So... It's three pages long. Oh my gosh, where am I going to cry? Okay, this is December. Okay. Oh my gosh. Okay. Dear Joe, this year has been crazy. You graduated. You quit sound. You quit show choir. You stepped down from impact club. You led the worship team. You preached. You even got to make a lot of new friends through a pandemic. Hello, well. Also, you didn't get corona. Yay. You went through the awkward stage of becoming an adult. You turned 18. You said goodbye to high school. You started your early life business. You also opened up select nutrition. A lot of crazy firsts, including this. Your first boyfriend. Your first case. First date. Corona style. The first time driving. The first time getting your permit. Your first time getting all organized and cleaning and cooking on a regular basis. A little... I hope you only says back soon. If you don't know who you only says, you only says, my nanny from when I was two. She is also like our housekeeper. Since I was two, so she would come Monday through Friday. She would cook clean and like take care of everything at the house. While we were in school, in her business, whatever it had to be. But I still was in school at this time. So I had to learn how to cook in 2020 and do all my stuff by myself. So you only says back. I said, and a lot of unexpected firsts. Your first time you had to forgive. The first time going through a difficult family challenge. The first time having to leave the team at home and at the park and at church. A whole pandemic. The first time you went through a breakup. First time you faced a lot of new challenges. The first time you truly have had to go through healing. And right now it seems like life is hard. It's frustrating. It won't get better, but I remember God's promises for me. He is for you, Joe. The God of the universe loves you and is for you. I just finished writing my goals down on my vision board for 2021. And it seems crazy. But I know all things are possible through God. And I know that he has plans to prosper you and not to harm you. He loves you and meets you right where you are. You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be willing and abiding him. Right now I'm listening to the song. It's honestly a word. God speaking to me right now. Abide. There is no striving. Just abiding. I pray that you're more on fire for God than ever before. That you put him first in everything you do. That you go to him first. That you see him first. That you give to him first. I pray that you're smart with your priorities. The time that God has gifted you here on earth. I pray that you grow in love. Patience, kindness. That you serve God with that same passion, love, commitment. I pray that you love people. Connect with people as much as you can. That God gives you favor opportunity. Room to grow into the person he has called you to be. I pray that you stay humble. That you always remain a learner. That you lead with that confidence. That comes from God. Parent disease. God-fiddance. That you surround yourself with like-minded people. Continue to help serve people who come into your life. Invest in the youth. Invest. Disciple teach. Do it. The time is now. Connect with your team. Pray over them. Be real. Honest. Raw. Encourage people. Speak life. Pray that your team grows in ways you didn't expect. I pray that you love on them. See the good in people. I pray that you stay committed. Disciplined. Active. Healthy. I pray that God opens doors for you to influence people for good. That you lead people to him. Give him all the glory. I pray that you reach your health, fitness goals. But more importantly, that you respect yourself. Value and honor yourself. And who God made you to be by sticking to your boundaries. That you learn how to be led by the Holy Spirit and not your emotions. I pray that you use your resources to serve God and his people. Remember the blessings that God gives you. Are to bless and serve others. Put others before yourself. Give. Tide with faith. Give. With a joyful heart. You're able to buy a car. Drive your car. Serve people with the time. Money and resources you have. I pray that you give yourself to God as a living sacrifice. Everything you are doing has a bigger purpose beyond yourself. I pray that God continues to give you favorite grace opportunity to show his love to the world through you. Continue to focus on him and his kingdom because it's eternal. Be patient.

Pray for this next year in your life. It should be exciting. Fill with joy. Rejoice every day for this is the day the Lord has made. We will rejoice and be gladinate. Pray for vision that God gives you the ability. The eyes to see beyond what your natural eyes can see. He is good. He is faithful. Stay faithful. My love. Remember who you are. You are a child of God. You are chosen. You are set apart. You are unique. You are valuable. You are fearfully and wonderfully made. You are the daughter of the king. Not just any king, but the king of kings and the Lord of Lords. Let him define you and let him sit on the throne of your heart. I love you. I'm so excited for what's to come. One last thing. The best is yet to come. Love you. I'm Joe 2020. Oh my gosh. Like I said, I am different than I was last year. I'm so thankful because I feel. I feel like God. Oh okay. Let me read a little bit. I'm very thankful for this last year. It's been probably the most difficult. I've had to go through. One day I'll be able to tell my like my story and share what God did specifically. But right now I just want to say thank you to God for taking me out of this. Let me pick and putting my feet on solid rock on the solid foundation because um a lot of things and people leave and change. But God is the same. I also wanted to myself. I wanted to see how far I've come. I wanted to see what God has done. How I thought last year and how I'm going into this new year. It's very exciting. I'm very excited for this next year and I'm so I'm crying mainly because I'm really thankful that I'm not that hurt girl anymore. That I am here. That God is faithful and that he led me to to forgive and to to trust and to walk in confidence and not insecurity to love people who hurt me. I'm so excited for this next year. 2022 is going to be great. I was commenting to someone. I think it was my mom. Not sure but I feel like this last year God had to allow my heart to heal. Like grow deep roots with him. So that when it is time to start building I do not thought because I am rooted. I rooted in him and who he says I am and what he's called me to do. And so everything I build from that source and that foundation is going to stand from because it's on solid ground and it doesn't change. Wow okay that was a little emotional moment. I was watching the my livestream that I posted on my instagram. I just can't believe I was like that. I'm so excited. I'm so happy. I'm so proud and I'm in a season in my life where it's just God. God has healed me and he's moving me forward. It's time to build. It's time to produce. It's time to work and be faithful and I'm really excited for that. I love doing that. I love serving God and serving His people. So many changes are going to come as well as on my YouTube channel. I want to post more faith stuff and share more about that because it is a big part of my life. And I encourage you. I'm going to do this again because I want to see where I'm at next year. I'm excited. I'm so excited. I'm probably going to do the same thing. We'll see. I'm going to write a letter to myself. I encourage you to do the same. In my Instagram video, I kind of mentioned how I was lucky. A prayer. A prayer to God. Where I want to be and who I want to be come. So just reaffirms the vision that God that God will has for my life. That that may send. I'm going to keep this because it's very near and dear to my heart. I remember writing this on the floor. I was so heartbroken. I was just done. I was done with life. But I still chose to write out that truth of maybe being a child of God, maybe chosen, maybe instead of part all these things that I like. Set over myself. I just want to encourage anyone who may be going through a hard, difficult challenge in your life. Whether it be losing someone, whether it be heartbreak or a breakup or whatever. A difficult time or season you're going through in your life. Just know that you are so loved. You have a hope that there is a hope. There is a future for you and that the best is yet to come. A moment in time does not define who you are. Just know that there's so much hope. So many great things are to come and that what you went through. What you went through will glorify God. I love you guys. If you want to more info on what to do about the letter and how to do it, just message me and I can help you guys out. My Instagram is going to be down below and I'm really excited.

" Hi guys, it's me, Danny. I've been thinking about something for the past like a couple months honestly, and it's been kind of life changing for me, so I thought I would share it with you guys. So my friend was over last night, and she was telling me about how like in her life, she just wanted it to go differently, and she kind of wishes she was somewhere else in her life right now, and she feels like she's had so many bad days recently, like her life just kind of sucks right now, and she's very down like in general. And I told her this thing that I've been thinking of how you can either see your life as like a bad life, like I'm having a really hard time right now, or you can just see it as a bad day, and then tomorrow could be good or bad or whatever. And it's something I've been thinking for a while because I always used to do this thing where if I felt sad, I would like apply it to my entire week or month, and it was like I'm having a really hard time right now. Like I would always say that to Emma, and he would be like, Danny, like, yeah, you're having a bad day, but your life isn't bad. Like you were happy like a week ago, you're not necessarily having a hard time right now. And I was like, hmm, that's interesting. Like sometimes, yeah, if you're a freaking failing member dies or something, like yeah, that makes sense. Like you'd have a really hard time in life. But in terms of just regular life and normal issues that come and go mental health problems, like career stuff, whatever, things are constantly going up and down. Like even in the span of a day, you can have a horrible morning and a great evening, you know? And so the tendency to kind of label an entire life as bad or an entire time period as not good, I think is a little bit harmful to your mental health. And what I mean by that is that you can see things whatever way you want to see it. And this is kind of where my radical acceptance thing to my therapist talking comes in. He always talked about how like if someone hurts me, I can either view it as them trying to hurt me or I can view it as me just feeling hurt by something that somebody else did. And it kind of removes the responsibility from anybody and it just attributes the feelings to feelings. Does that make sense? So it's not like, oh, this person hurt me. This person is a jerk. This person should have done better. It's like, oh, I'm feeling a lot of hurt right now. I should probably like figure this out and talk to this person and fix our relationship or cut them out of my life or whatever. And there's not this like vindictive, angry view of the world. And the same goes for what I was talking about with my friend. Like when bad stuff in life happens, you can either view it as everything bad is happening to me. My life is so bad. Everything is so terrible. Or you can view it as, oh, I had a bad day today. I'm going to try again tomorrow. And even if you have 100 bad days, right? Even if your entire year has been horrible. You still don't have to view it as a bad life. And I know that that's hard. Like it's definitely a lot easier said than done. But if everybody could get to a point in life where they're just like, oh, yeah, I had a bad morning or I had a bad night. But tomorrow might be better. And if every night you went to sleep thinking, okay, whatever happened today is a relevant. Like it's over. It already happened. I'm going to try again tomorrow. I feel like we would be a lot happier like as human. I feel like there's this tendency to lean into your sadness a lot and to lean into your mental health issues because for so long, like mental health issues were just completely ignored. And like nobody wanted to talk about it. So nowadays in 2021, oh wait, it's 2022. Nowadays in 2022, everybody's like, we have to talk about this. My mental health is really bad. Everything is bad. I need to be sad. I need to express my feelings. I need to feel this right this second. Like my trauma is ruining my life. Like, you know, you guys see that stuff on social media all the time. So do I. I'm even, you know, responsible of doing that for sure. And people kind of started even hating on positivity. Like toxic positivity. And like, don't be so happy all the time. Like I'm sad and just let me be sad. So there's definitely some truth to that. Like movement. Like I'm definitely not saying that's wrong. But I think the goal should just be to have some kind of middle ground between that, right? And there's nothing wrong with kind of just putting your feelings away and saying, okay, I'm going to deal with that later. As long as you're still taking care of yourself. And that's again, kind of goes back to my thing of it's not a bad life. It's just a bad day because if you're just constantly living in your sadness and your issues all the time, yeah, it could be a bad life. And like you could definitely see it as that. Or you can just see it as I'm really struggling right now. And I'm going to deal with my feelings and whatever. But I still have a chance to make it better. And also, let's go beyond that. What even is the definition of a bad day? Like if you were sad that day, if you were angry that day, is it a bad day? Do you have to call it a bad day? Do you have to call it a bad morning? If you woke up in a bad mood, like I'm not saying everything has to be perfect all the time. But you could also just see it as a mood. You could see it as neutral. You could see it as you felt something. You know, somebody hurt you. You yelled, you screamed, you cried, whatever it was. Like you can see those things, but you don't have to label them as good or bad. I feel like the good emotions are like happiness and euphoria and joy and love and forgiveness or whatever that means. And then all the bad feelings are like anger, sadness, jealousy. Like it's like all that stuff is labeled as good or bad. And I understand why some things are labeled as bad. But you also don't have to do that. It doesn't have to feel good, but it doesn't have to be bad. It can just be I felt this way today. Today I had a shitty time. You know, I spent the whole day in bed and it didn't feel very good. Tomorrow I'm going to try to do better. And if the next day you still don't do better, you just keep going because I always tell Emma this like, what the hell else are you going to do? Are you going to stop? Are you going to give up? No, you're not going to give up. You're not going to die, right? You're just going to keep living. So your options are to keep living and to not try and to just say that you have a bad life and everything sucks and that's it because that's what I always used to do. Or you can say, okay, I'm going to keep trying tomorrow and I'm going to keep trying to get better. And I'm not going to get so down on myself if I fail. And if I miss the mark and maybe today I didn't do some crazy self improvement thing and oh, I spent the whole day in bed. I'm a horrible person. Like you don't have to feel so bad about yourself because there's not this expectation. And that all just goes back to my acceptance thing. Like you don't have expectations of what your life is supposed to be. Or who you should be, who other people should be, where you should be in your life. Like I'm going to look at everybody else who is 21 years old and has a savings account or a perfect relationship or whatever. And I'm going to feel bad about myself because I don't have a savings account and I don't have a perfect relationship, right? Like that's a tendency. That's what everybody does. That's what I do every single day. I look at other girls' bodies and I'm like, I wish I looked like that, you know? And it makes me feel bad about myself. But if I break it down, like I'm only feeling bad about myself because of the comparison. If the comparison wasn't there, if I didn't know that other people existed, I wouldn't feel bad about myself because I would just be. And that's it. So if you just stop expecting everything to be a certain way, you won't be let down as much. And I think you'll appreciate life more because it's not going to be like, oh, I was so sad today. It was a horrible day. It could be like, oh, I had a very transformative day actually. I cried the whole day and I actually feel a lot better tonight. There's always a way that you can spend things not necessarily to be positive, but just to not be so sad all the time. And when I started thinking like that and trying to complain less, I've just noticed a huge shift in my life in my mindset. So yeah, if you guys are feeling like shit all the time, maybe this will help you. Maybe it won't. I don't know. But I've just been thinking about it a lot and I hope that you guys understand what I'm saying. Before I go, I have a sweatshirt that I made and it's my merch. And it's almost sold out. There's literally 10 size smalls left. Like there's very few unisex size smalls left. It's sold down every other size. So I want to make a new hoodie. I might want to restock this one. I'm not sure, but these size smalls are just hanging on by a thread. So go to the link in my description and check out this hoodie. And if you're a unisex size small, which is kind of just like a min size small, it's like a bigger women size small, go to the description and check it out. Okay, I love you guys. Thank you for listening to my rambling. Goodbye.",well-being
" Hi, I really hate my life at this point. I hate what I've done in it. I hate what it's going and so far it's going nowhere. I hate that I have a mental illness. I hate having very little friends. I mean most of our friends are either at the Foreign Health or at church. I hate that I don't have a girlfriend or having had much experience with sex. I mean I hate that I don't that I can't do anything about it. I feel feel feel like a failure. I mean it makes me want to contemplate taking taking my life. It's really getting to that point and unfortunately my life is not mine to take. I just wish the Lord would come soon to get to get me out of this slurker. I hate that nobody looks at me as anything but a freak or a creep. I mean there isn't much more I could say.",well-being
" Part of my junior year and part of my, in all of my senior year, I was attending high school on the Basin Japan. While I was there, I met this woman, this girl, and got to know her through her brother. She was a big girl and everything. She got a job in the NCO club where I was watching dishes. She was Boston tables. We flirted all the time and we were talking to her from Cut-Off. We really had a lot of chemistry. But I was just a shy, fat, sit face. I mean, no self-esteem at all. Get home. And I never did anything about it. And one night I was at the movie theater and I saw her in a distance of the part of the parking lot walking in to go see the same movie. She was by herself. And I sat, I was sitting, I got out of the theater and I sat, I saw what she was sitting because it was just like the big knee on the side. Come sat with me. And I didn't do it. I sat there, just too shy and too insecure. I was rooted in this chair. I was a little bit of a theater. And then I watched the movie. One home didn't think anymore about it. I was used to doing crap like that. My teenage years of terrible. And then I saw her at the end of the year. I asked her if she enjoyed the movie. She said it's sad. She came in and she was throwing trays around and slamming them. She was pretty angry. And finally she came back a little later and she calmed down. She said, you know, guys are supposed to make the first move. And that was the end of that. You know, I know. So on the old line, I'm 63 years old and I still think about her and I still think about that night. And I wrote a story about it.",well-being
" I'm 30 years old and looking back in my 20s, in a way I completely wasted them. In this video, I'm just going to explain how I did that, what was going through my mind, my belief systems, and why it's actually a paradox and a good thing that I wasted my 20s. The reason for that being that it led me to where I am today. Let me explain. My entire 20s, I was driven basically by my ego and it's attempt to receive external validation from the world and other people. My ego was very fragile. It caused me to put on many different masks where many different costumes, metaphorical costumes. To impress other people, I wanted people to view me certain ways. I wanted them to view the way I thought I should be viewed. I put on these masks, hoping that they'd see me for who I wanted them to see me as. There's always something missing inside of me. I had a normal childhood. I had a great childhood, great family, a lot of friends, loving family and friends, good school, good opportunities. But there's always something missing. There's always something missing in here, so I sought it from the outside world. In my early 20s, I decided to go to school for something that I knew would make me a lot of money that would make my parents proud, that would make my friends think that I was successful. I went to school for that and I got a job afterwards for something directly related to what I went to school for in hopes that people would view me as successful, view me as somebody who made it. I did all that and I got the job and I worked the job and I made a lot of money all for other people and all for the way other people viewed me. The thing about that is that people get to decide whatever they want to think about me. They get to believe what they believe. Even though I'm trying to do this, trying to make them see me a specific way, they may never not see me that way. That's why it's very futile to seek external validation because at the end of the day, I'm not the one who gets to decide what other people think of me. I went and got this awesome job that at least I thought was awesome and I thought other people would think is awesome. In reality, I did not enjoy. I didn't get any fulfillment from it. I only got money from it and that money just fed into my consumerism and materialism which was also external validation seeking because once again, I wanted people to see me as somebody who is successful. I wanted to be respected. I was sort of the center of the universe in other people's worlds. I was putting myself. I wanted to be the center of attention in other people's worlds and once again, it doesn't work that way. I don't get to decide what the center of someone's universe is. But I spent my whole 20s doing that. I did everything based on external validation and I had a complete external locus of control. I went and I bought a fancy sports BMW $80,000 vehicle because I wanted people to see that and sort of have their jaws drop. He's got that car at that age. Man, he's made it. So I had the house, I had the car. I went and bought a bunch of expensive outfits. There were times where I was probably wearing between all the items of clothing that I spent money on. I was wearing close to a thousand bucks between all the layers of shirts and my pants and my fancy shoes and the fancy chain and rings and accessories and jacket. It was a lot of money I spent because that's what I thought people, because that way I could kind of control what people were thinking of me. Basically what I was doing was I was going to the circus dressing up as a clown and performing for people and I was making an identity, multiple identities throughout the course of my 20s. Based on what I wanted people to see me as, I was a clown at the circus. And the thing about clowns that are professional clowns, they do all that. They dress up and then they go to the circus. But then at the end of the day they realize that that's not who they are. They wipe the makeup off and then they go home and live their lives. I never did that. I was 100% clown all the time. I would play tricks on myself and say, this is who I am. I'm this rebel, this guy who marches to the beat of my own drum. I even got tattoos because I thought people would think I was cool. I had an image I had to give off. I had many expectations of people to see me a certain way. Anyassure, I did. Sometimes get some validation from people. People would ask me what my job people would compliment me on my vehicle or the way I looked. But at the end of the day it was nowhere near of what I expected of people, of the attention that I thought I should get. Poppies, come on. My whole sense of purpose and being was coming from the outside. But it was all on my terms. People had to see me the way I wanted to be seen. And nothing was coming from within here. This led to a lot of suffering, pain and depression. It was all self-inflicted. I self-medicated with substances, alcohol and other illicit substances. My entire 20s, in my early 20s, it wasn't that bad. But as I progressed through my 20s, it built the depression and the anxiety built. So I sort of treated all this pain with substances. And they worked for a time and then they sort of lost their effect. When I was about 20-70, anxiety that had been building in my body because of the way I was living my life, it had built in my body so greatly that it started mapping. I was manifesting in severe physical symptoms. One day I woke up, while I was walking down my stairs and I lost my balance and went into the wall. And for three months, I had no balance. I had to walk. Like I had to widen my stance and walk, just to walk in a straight line. Looking back on it now, it's actually, I look back and it was, I can kind of find, see the humor in it. At the time, it was complete darkness. The anxiety manifested in other forms to it. It manifested as, you know, my whole body was spasming. I would feel sensation of paralysis in my limbs. I would get blurry vision and I would get partial or complete and or complete blindness in one, or both of my eyes. This usually happened at night. It was very scary time. The doctors thought I had MS and there was a lot of testing that was done with no evidence. And one doctor thought that I should go on some volume for the spasms I was having. And it fixed everything. The volume is an anti-anxiety medication and it fixed everything. All my symptoms were gone. Like within two days of on-valume, everything was gone. So the doctor, that doctor, knew right away that I was suffering psychosomatic anxiety disorder and that's what it was. So I didn't start as self-medicating with. I then started medicating in my late 20s heavily with alcohol and other substances that inevitably led to a mental breakdown when I was 29. And I ended up in a detox facility and rehab facility for seven weeks. And that was the point where I sort of had a bit of a shift and then I sought therapy. And I went, I did some heavy therapy for two years. And that is where I learned to sort of disconnect from everything. So my entire 20s I was living through a great deal of pain and suffering and it was a good thing. So I suffered a great deal through my 20s and it was all worth it. Because it led to my breakdown, which inevitably led to a mindset shift, complete belief system reset. I thought I had to believe certain things to be who I was. I was not living as my own person. So this breakdown led me to this and I was able to sort of rebuild and uncover who I truly was. I was able to disconnect from everything that I thought I needed to be. And I was able to disconnect from the fact that I can't control what other people think and what they think of me. That's not any of my business what people think of me. I can only be who I am and people are going to think whatever they want to me whether it's good or bad. That's out of my control. So yeah, in a way I wasted my 20s but in a way it wasn't a waste at all. It wasn't a waste at all. It's a great paradox of life. Because if I never went through what I went through I never would have had the breakdown which led me to where I am today. And where I am today is much better than where I was in my 20s. And a lot of people they go through life struggling, never really understanding why. And I should speak for myself because everybody's life is different. But if I never would have had that breakdown I could have went through my entire life lost. So I'm thankful that I went through the pain and the suffering. And I'm thankful for where that has led me today. So tell me what you think does any of this relate to your experience? The whole purpose of this video is to if this can relate to you or anybody. I wanted to share this experience because maybe there's somebody out there that can kind of relate to what I'm saying.",well-being
" Nobody cares about you. I remember growing up just feeling different. Always feel like I'm left out of things. Growing up, I used to always care about people and put others first. When I used to go out and play with my friends at the park or when there's snack time in class, I used to always go to the corner store and buy a lot of snacks and drinks. And when I would get back to the park, I would share with everybody. And everybody would be happy. And I would make sure I give everybody a bag of chips. And if they didn't want something to eat, I would give them a drink. And you know when we're all kids, we just eat chips and drink hugs. Baguette chips used to be a quarter and a small hug drink would be a quarter. Those were the good times. And I remember during class, when I would bring a snack and when some of my classmates didn't have nothing to eat and they asked me if they could get some, I would give them some of my snack, whether it's chips, cookies or whatever I had. But I remember there were a few days where I didn't have any money. I couldn't buy my own chips and drinks. And when they had snacks and we were all playing at the park when they had something to drink, I would ask them, can I get some chips? And they would say no. And that really got to me because all these, all this time I got called back. I would share with everybody. Put them when I'm down, when I don't have any money, when I have nothing to eat. Nobody cared about me. I just sat by myself and I just felt stupid. I just felt like I didn't really have any true friends. I didn't really have anybody that cared about me. And the same thing would happen in class if I forget to bring a snack where I didn't have money and I had nothing to eat. And I asked the same people that I share with, like, hey, can I get a piece? And they would be like, no. That's when I realized nobody cares about you in this world. Everybody just wants to be around you. Everybody just wants to be around you when you have money, when you can feed them, when you can help them. But the moment you're down, and you don't have any money or you don't have anything, nobody sees you anymore. Nobody cares about you anymore. Nobody cares. And life just sucks. I remember when I was younger, just growing up being different and just feeling like I was ugly and I used to think, like, if I could just be average, if I could just fit in with everybody else and just get along. How life would be so much better. And I remember one time I was at the playground with my friends. And there was this one girl that came up to me and she was like, I've never met somebody as ugly as you. Like, you're so ugly. Like, you're really ugly. I remember telling her, I remember saying like, I know I'm ugly. And I wish I was better looking. But I'm not. Nobody cares about you. And life itself is just a constant struggle. I feel like I can never get a peace of mind. There's always the next challenge. Once I saw one thing, another problem comes. It is never ending. It's like I used to struggle with relationships, but then when I get a girlfriend, I guess I just dated the wrong ones a few times. And I was just a nice guy. I was too nice and I always cared about their feelings and always made sure that they're happy. But perhaps I was just treating the wrong person right. And all they ever did was cheat on me and flirt with other guys and just left me for somebody else. Even relationships, it's a struggle to find someone that you're compatible with. Someone that actually has your back. Somebody that actually loves you and cares about you and isn't selfish. Even relationships, you gotta go through so many toxic relationships and so many people who don't deserve you. It's hard to just find some people who are loyal and trustworthy and you know will be there for you no matter what. It's so hard to find people like that. And it's not just finding a girlfriend as loyal, it's finding friends that are loyal. Finding genuine people that actually care about you. It's a constant struggle. And you don't have as much friends and then the little bit of friends that you have in high school, once you graduate, you no longer really communicate with them. We kinda all just go down our different paths and we kinda just separate. And life after school is just loneliness and you really only have a few friends if that. And then all it really is, it's just working nine to five. And most people are just miserable and lost and don't really know what they wanna do with their life or just, and you just work your whole life away until you're old and if the economy is any good, you might be able to retire. And then from there, you have a few years left and then you just die. That's all life really is. You're born, you go to school, you work, you get old, you retire and then you just die. Sometimes I really wonder what the purpose of life is. It's a lot of suffering, a lot of, it's just a lot of emotional trauma and suffering and betrayal and struggles. And the only advice that we really get is, oh, make sure you go to college, make sure you go to college. Not everybody's meant to go to college. Not everybody really, it's not really the best path for some people because some people just ends up getting their degree and can't even get a job in that field. It's just a waste of money. And you know what the worst feeling is when you have a degree and you feel like that degree is worthless. And you feel worthless. That's the worst feeling. When you feel like a degree on your resume means nothing. When you can't even land a job interview, when it can't even get past, they're automated system that just rejects you. You don't even get a human to look at that resume with a degree on there. You feel worthless. And even when you have a degree, you don't have any experience. If you haven't, it's like a degree means nothing when you have no experience, when you have no connections. When entry level jobs require five years of experience, it's just frustrating. It's like, what was the point of me going to school then? What was the point of me getting this degree? Like, can we have some real entry level jobs? Can we get some real entry level jobs that require no experience? Can we see some of that? And then when jobs want five professional references, like I could be hardworking, I could, I'm a quick learner, but I don't have the five references that you want. Five professional references that you want. I don't have that. I don't have that much work experience. And then being an introvert, it's just hard to connect with people to get these professional references. But I know if I put my mind to something and I work hard, I could do it. I could do the job. And perhaps on paper, I don't look like the most qualified person. But then I see a bunch of people that get hired because everything looks good on their resume. They look qualified on their resume, but they're not really the best fit for that company and they don't do the best job, but they get hired. I don't know, it's just life is too hard, man. There's always the next challenge and the next challenge, you fix this another problem. I'm tired, I'm tired. I'm tired of figuring shit out. I'm tired of trying to solve these problems. And it's true, nobody in this world can help you. Nobody in this world cares about you and nobody in this world can help you. The only person that can help you is yourself. And that's just a lonely world, such a lonely world to live in. Like sometimes I feel like if poor people brand the government, life will probably be so much better. Because the rich people, they don't understand the struggles of everyday poor people. When they don't know something, they just hire people to solve their problems. They have connections. They have the money to just fix things. You understand how it feels to be poor and when you don't know something, you just don't have the money to hire people to figure things out for you. You can't hire people to solve your problems. Now, only poor people genuinely knows how it feels to be down here. And I feel like the older we get, we just have less friends and a way society is going. Nowadays, everybody is so isolated. Everybody's just on their devices. Everybody wants human connection, but nobody wants to reach out with nobody wants to actually connect. I just want a few solid friends. I just had your back when you're down and you know you'll have their back when they're down. That's just what I want. And it's even worse when you don't have supportive parents. Your parents are the ones that care about you yet they're the first ones to put you down. They're the first ones to tell you that you're useless, that you're nothing, that you're just trash and never support you in anything you do. Everything, everything you do is wrong. If you don't do what they want you to do, you're wrong. It's like, can I just do what I like? Do you even know what I like to do with my life? Do you even know what makes me happy? And perhaps I have certain passions that I want to pursue. Can I just do that? What I'll be compared to everybody else, like, oh, look at your cousin. Look at this person, look at that person. They're so successful. Can I not be compared with anybody else because I'm me? I'm not them. And there's always about them being better than you as certain things. What about me being good at things? What about the things that I'm good at? Is that not important? Life definitely does suck. And there's a lot of struggles. What all we can really do is live day by day, take one day at a time, one step at a time, and I don't know, life just sucks, man. And just societal pressure. And sometimes the pressure can really get to you and you just feel worthless. And you just feel like you're not built for this world. Like, there's days where I feel like I'm just not built for this world. Like, this world is too much. I'm just not meant to be in it. I don't know, it's tough. I just constantly tell myself, the best thing that I could do is just keep holding on and just keep pushing. I just gotta take it one day at a time, and focus on one step at a time. I just gotta keep going. I just gotta be myself. And I just gotta be my best self and keep pushing. I think we all have them days where we feel like we wanna give up. I think the most scariest thing if you really think about it is not everybody wins. And life you'll have winners and you'll have losers. Not everybody makes it. And that's just biology. It's natural selection. I hope we all make it. But the only thing we can do is just try our best and keep pushing forward. That's all we can offer. That's all we can do. At the end of the day, like, sucks is constant. Constant battles and struggles and tired. I really feel like I'm tired of this world. I have to keep going. We all have to keep going. And we all have to try our best and try to make it. And try not to let, and try not to let the pressure get to us.",well-being
" What's the point of life? Tworkin 9-5 in Diabro? I just give that title a like... Ever since I was a kid, all I've done was make videos, bro. That's literally all I've done, bro. That's the thing I've been passionate about. Since I was a kid, I've been doing this. The thing you call YouTube Pressing Playmaking videos. Since I was a kid, bro. And the fact I haven't made yet sucks is I'm not gonna shoot the content. I'm not gonna say I don't feel bad or sad. Oh, it sucks I've been doing YouTube for years. And I have barely just made it. It's fake. But what I've made is so fake. Oh, for sure, man. And it's like I've been wanting this all my life and I can't give it up, man. I can't give it up. So what's the point back to what I was saying? What's the point of life if you can't have your dreams. If you can't succeed, if you can't do what you're all you want to do what you're all you want to do. But you're forced to do what you don't want to do. When life should be about doing what you love and how come I can't make it do it? When I love how come life has to suck God like what is your plan for my life? Am I supposed to just sit and not hear to just suffer? All we all hear to just suffer and die. Because a lot of people make it but a lot of people don't. That's the reality. There's a lot of people who aren't making it. A lot of people say, falling your dreams, takes your dreams and aren't making it. There's a lot of people in a lot of small cities that want to be YouTubers. There's millions of people that want to be YouTubers. Why can't everyone be YouTubers? Why can't everyone be big? Why does majority of society have to settle for less? Why? Why does life like that? And I think I've just come to think there's a life that's unfair. It doesn't always anything. We're not owed anything. It's like we're not owed success. We're not owed a good life. I guess life just people have to suffer. There's no good without evil. There's no yin without yin. Why? What's the point of it all? To just suffering. To die. And nothing after. We're really good. So here's suffering. Die. And nothing after. Is that really? That's our life. That's what we're here for. Work your 9-5. Be a loser. Buy. This is what I do this man. Because I have no purpose outside of this. I literally have nothing. I'll do it in this. Except the regular 9-5. We can live off that. What is the point of it all? Especially if you're nobody. Especially if you're broke. Especially if nothing's going on in your life. What's the point? You feel me? See you on the next repeat.",well-being

everybody the truth and they're like no that's bullshit you don't know what you're talking about so I struggle with that I struggle with that you know for my thing is I love all races I love black people I love white people I love Hispanics I love white people I love all and I know that when we die this game we are in is an illusion it's not real but you have some people that feel as a dough feel as though it's real so I struggle with with me actually having love for every race because if you're in a room with a person that's wounded that doesn't like another race they're gonna judge you and that's something I'll struggle with I love white people I love them I love them I love Hispanic people I love them I have a white play mother I have a Hispanic friends she's saying Texas I have a black friend her name is Kay I got so many white friends you know I'm saying so many black I got them all and I struggle with this because you have some people where they're so tied to the history in the past and they can't let it go and I understand that but I love all races and I get judged for it I know I do I know a lot of people got mad when I didn't post about the black lives matter I know but once you have this higher mind you know that we all have to come together and not be separated you know but sometimes when I gain all this wisdom I have trouble because you almost go through this whole journey of expressing and learning and now you're placing a room with people that's not learning or that's not really experiencing this wonderful experience you're feeling so now you feel like the outcast because people not talking about the deep shit you're talking about and that's just me where I know all this deep information I know about past lives recard nation that we're not the skin that the soul is immortal and you can't go in a party to talk about this deep stuff you just can't because they go and judge you and that's really what I have to go through is I know too much and especially when I go home my family don't talk about all this ancient wisdom they just don't they either turn up a drink and I accept them I love them but it hurts because it's like I'm holding all the pain and baggage of my family and they just don't know they don't know but it's something that's real so I hope y'all felt me in this little kind of like an interview documentary but just me opening up about what the fuck I feel in man this journey drains me to it drains the fuck out of me because I see so much shit and I know so much and when you know the truth in the world that praises lies you almost feel like I damn alien like shit that happened in this world and I just wrote it I'm like I get it I know why it's here but you got some people that think it's so real and I feel they pain I feel them it's like damn I know you can't escape I know you can't you know another thing to his music like hold on I don't know if y'all heard that music but music man I never really understood music especially when I became awakened so how music really works you know you played a radio and you hear all this crazy shit fuck the bitchy talky she's still my dick yeah I got the block of my waist you know what I'm saying it's just all just pain and anger and frustration I thought music was supposed to be love and another thing too I be in the car with my brother and my family and they playing all this crazy music and I'm just sitting there taking taking a pun all that vibration because music is vibration but people don't know this but this is something I struggle with is where people would judge me because I don't like rap music well I don't like all that extra shit I like something where I can vibe to relax to cleanse my mind to you know I'm saying so this was Jacob's talks thank you best friend for the name we was in the bed I mean it was not in the bed but it was on FaceTime I was in the bed and I was like I need a name for these podcast I need a name for these

" What is up my lovely people today we're having a serious chat This one's kind of heavy man. This one's real heavy But first let me talk about the fact that This video is a replacement for the vlog that I was gonna do for this week Well, it's not our placement. I'm gonna be vlogging tomorrow on Friday, which is my last day of school But unfortunately was not in the mood to vlog today was not in the mood that not in the mood to vlog on Wednesday Because Tuesday was not a good day and also yesterday was probably one of the hardest days I've ever had You know just gonna throw that out there So you might be wondering what happened Tuesday because I post a vlog on Tuesday You guys are like oh, Jay will you man look like having fun you yeah, that a lot of fun but Third hour I was chilling and I was just not happy not at all man and I Just simply could not go to fourth hour and you guys know I've been skipping a little bit I've been skipping fourth hour a little bit because you know the class is fairly easy I just took a final today. It's pretty easy didn't really need to be in class to know all this stuff Still I don't really condone skipping school. I shouldn't be skipping school The third hour I was like you know what I'm so done and then I skipped fourth hour I just went in my car I cried a little bit. I went to McDonald's and had a full large coke within the span of like 20 minutes And if you don't know I love soda. I love soda to death But that was not good bro any who so I basically just stayed in my car for maybe three hours And then I finally went home around two thirty or three and for reference I had Got in out of school because I skipped at 11.45. So 11.45 to about two thirty. I'm doing absolutely nothing but crying, you know and I just wasn't having it that day, you know I've had a lot of bad days recently a lot of days where I just couldn't even Muster up the ability to go to school or work, you know Tuesday. I had to call out work I was supposed to get trained on kitchen Tuesday, but I couldn't I told them I had a family emergency I lied the emergency is me. I'm the crisis. I'm the family emergency So I got home and a few hours later my mom is like hey James Why am I getting a call from the school? Because you know the school they call her whenever you miss a day and I just told her straight up. I was like I skipped I was sad and I cried in my car My mom knows I have some problems. She knows I've been down recently You know if she's the one who I you know I went to her for the therapist. I've been seeing my therapist regularly but My mom had a big talk with me and at one point in the talk she was like are you having suicidal thoughts and I just nodded man I just I just like And it broke her heart And it was really sad to see my mom, you know Uh just to see my mom like that You know And I have these thoughts about running away all the time I always think like if I can't live happy I can just kind of drive cross country do whatever I want And then after that I'll die happy, you know But Seeing my mom like that and obviously I wasn't gonna do it anyway. I wasn't gonna run away But seeing my mom like that was just so heartbreaking And I bet her seeing me like this is so heartbreaking And it sucks It's it really sucks It really sucks man So she knows I have suicidal thoughts her first I was having this conversation with her and she was like do I need to call your dad? I'm gonna call your dad and I was like I was balling my eyes out and like please do not call my dad like Because I wanted my dad to know but I didn't want him to be on the call right then and there I just didn't I couldn't handle it Um but after the talk, you know my mom she's just concerned about me. She's just worried about me She was like do we need to take you to the hospital? I was like you're not taking me to the hospital I'm not going to a mental hospital Like straight simple as that My parents sent me to a mental hospital. I will run away for real And I will move out because I swear to god that is not something I want to do what so ever So My mom was like should we get you a psychiatrist and maybe they can prescribe you something and I was like You know what if nothing else has worked by this point I've been feeling this way for a year and a half And granted it's been worse in the past month or two But I've had like a general depression for a little over a year and a half I'd say And I told my mom how long it's been going on And she you know She was just worried she was sad um So I might be seeing a psychiatrist and I might try to diagnose me with something or prescribe me some drugs or whatever I don't know dude. I think I'm open to anything. I think I'm open to anything If a psychiatrist works a psychiatrist works, you know um Not really the first option I'd go to but It has to be one of the options, you know So my mom told my dad about this whole situation yesterday. I was out with Esther And so now my both my parents know that I've been having dark thoughts like that um It's really tough man. I never wanted them to know I mean, I'm not comfortable sharing things with my parents But I guess um I have to to an extent And they ask me questions like is it because of your relationship? Is it because of school and this and that and I either kind of avoid the truth or I just won't tell them Because I don't want them to know the specifics. That's for me my therapist Another news my dad wants to drug test me Because I guess if someone has a great life and is still sad then It might be a drug thing I guess that's his way of thinking. I mean, I called him yesterday and he was like why are you depressed like you have a great life And I was like yeah, you're right man. I do have a great life But sometimes it doesn't seem that way to me You know, it's a mental thing it sucks. It's it's the whole thing sucks That's how that's how it is man but um we keep pushing through And I don't know if they're gonna go through with a drug test I called him on the phone yesterday. He didn't mention drugs, but he was like is it this it was that and I was like Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's kind of like school stressing me out and I was like it's not a drug thing though Cuz can't guys look I smoke weed If you knew the channel and you don't know that I smoke weed. I do it every night It helps me fall asleep. I've never been a good sleeper and straight up. I just enjoy it I just enjoy the feeling it makes me feel happy at the end of the night And that's why I do it and The but it's not the reason for my depression because it's been going on so much longer I started like regularly smoking weed about almost a year ago now and I've been experiencing depression for a year and a half So it's not a drug thing But if I do get drug tested, I'm going to turn up positive for marijuana and That's gonna suck But I'm kind of at a point where it's like if they find out they find out You know, I got two more what is it yet three more months until I move out like I don't know. What are you gonna do ground me? I'm about to turn 18. I'm about to move out You can ground me you can take my phone. I don't know I'd rather really not take my phone because I make videos on it, but um We'll just see what happens And if it turns out that I do get drug tested I'm just gonna come clean to my parents. I'm gonna tell them that I smoke weed at night because it helps me Helps me sleep and you know all the other reasons I just mentioned I think I'll be open about it, but not unless they like Find out, you know, I'm not just gonna go up to my parents and get as smoke weed But um that's currently what's going on So both of my parents know that I'm suicidal now and They might find out that I smoke weed if they drug test me. Well, if they drug test me they will surely find out But let's hope that doesn't happen Anyways, I have one more day of school. I have to one more day of high school, baby so um Yeah, I got about 4 and a half hours of actual school left and until I can finally be done with high school I have one week until graduation man one week a week from today Absolutely bonkers absolutely bonkers and I'm trying to get in contact with um a friend of mine So I recently found out a friend of mine is into creative writing and he's into film just like I am So I think it would be really cool if I collabed with him maybe made some short films that we can post on here Um right after I'm done recording this I'm gonna contact him and see if he'd be down. So I appreciate you guys for listening. I really do Because I know some of you are either experiencing What I experience or something similar to it or a lot of you guys are a bit older than me and you're looking like this reminds you of your teenage years and Either way, I appreciate you listening either way I love each and every one of you and We just hit a thousand subscribers baby go to go for 10,000.

" You know, I don't really love anyone in this world. I'm like really alone, like I'm really fucking lonely. I just want to come out here and I want to talk, say something, do something before I feel like I'm going to lose my fucking mind. I guess I'm trying to get away from all this shit, but you can't. It's impossible. You have to be around people. You have people fucking suck. People don't care about you. If you're a little weird or you're a little awkward, people fucking hate you. They don't want to be around you. And they don't care about any of your issues or how you feel whatsoever. That's the truth. I'm just starting like feeling this way, you know? Like I'm stuck, I'm trapped, I'm bored. There's nothing to do. Everything about life has to do with other people. And I don't want to be around other people anymore because all it is is disappointment every time. It's like they want you to be a certain way, but I can't be that way. I feel like I'm not supposed to be a part of this society. I don't fit in it. It's like really fucking irritating, man. I want to just drive away. Like I'm here in the back of the park and I just want to be by myself. It is like the most peaceful for me. So just be on my own. Just away from people. You know, I try so hard to like, to try and be normal, to be kind to others, to try and just fit in and create like relationships. But it's like impossible. I don't know. People just, if they don't like you, they don't like you. And it is what it is, you know? That's life. Life is bullshit. If you were born a certain way, like there's nothing you can do about it. And like that will always be a negative on you. It's easier for other people and it will be harder for you. I feel like most of life is decided from the moment you're born, depending on what location you're in, what kind of people are around you and neighborhood you grow up in, what kind of family you have. All of that is decided from the moment you're born and will impact everything else in your life. So if you had a fucked up family life, it's too late. Like that already has a big effect on you and you're going to use the rest of your life to try and fucking counteract all that bullshit that happened to you. Like it's really all about look in that way. But life is bullshit. That's what it is. Life is bullshit. And no matter how hard I cry or fucking complain about it, it's not going to change. This is just reality. I can dream about it. I can daydream all day about something better, but like this is reality. So I have to make what I can of it. Right? Because we're all going to fucking die someday anyways. So I just have to make what good I can of it, like whatever I can get out of this life. And whether it's making stupid videos and I know no one's going to watch this, no one's going to give a fuck or care about this. I'm still just going to put this up and hope someone can relate. I feel like no one gives a shit or cares about the problems I have or can relate to them. I want to try and do something where I put it online and I hope that people can listen and at least relate a little bit. That someone has the same issues. You know, I don't really love anyone in this world. I'm like really alone. Like I'm really fucking lonely. Like to a devastating extent. Like I'm such a loner. Like it's just my whole life. It's all I'm used to is being by myself. And I want to connect to someone. To me, like the thought of being close to someone almost seems like a far away dream. Like it doesn't even seem like something that's real. Yeah, it's so normal for other people. Yet for me to be close to someone, it just seems like something so far off that I could never do. You know, I don't know how I'm supposed to fix that. I was born a little weird, I guess. I don't know, I'm fucking, I've asked Pergerus maybe, I don't know, but I don't really know how to connect with anyone in a real way. She fucking bites at me, you know. I didn't do anything to the surf to be like this, but I'm just like that, I guess. And I'm going to make this video and no one's going to care either. But I just have to like keep trying, I guess. I hope at some point it gets better, but I don't know if it ever does. Or you just learn to live with it, you know. I guess it's a combination of things. Like I'm tired of being alone, but I'm also just tired of like life in the world itself. I'm just in my room and I keep thinking all the time and I just, I wish that there was more to this life. I wish it was better, but like that's reality and I hate reality right now. All I find myself doing is wishing that things were different, that things were better. But like this is just the cold reality right now and I don't like it at all. And it's been like this for years and I don't see it changing and I try and change it and it doesn't. I try and take matters into my hands. It's my own responsibility and I want to do things better. I've started to be more productive for like nothing changes. I've put myself out there to try and talk to people, but it doesn't work. Like I'm just meant to be like this. But I hope I share this video and someone relates to it. Someone can talk to me about this shit and tell me like yeah I did. I feel you man, like I've experienced this too. I don't know, I feel like no one's gonna fucking care. This isn't gonna reach anyone realistically. I say that as I hope that it does realistically probably won't. Your dreams are one thing, reality's another thing. And that sucks to realize that it really sucks. You know like when you watch a TV show, play a video game or something like that, it's like a great adventure. You know there's a plot to it. There's a character goes through a problem, they change, their problem is fixed. And that's not real life. Real life, there's a problem. You try your best to fix it and you don't know if the problem's gonna solve it. It probably won't. You know, you probably just get the bad ending. Your whole life is just a bad ending. And there's not much you can do about it. It feels like I wish I could have lived a normal life. I wish I could have lived a normal life I think. I don't know. I've just always, everything's always been so weird. Life feels so strange. I wish I could have just been normal, lived a normal fucking life. But like from the time I was a small child, I'd be here for real issues. I had family issues, everything was just strange. I've never fit in. I was just born to live a weird fucking life like this. It's tiring man. It's really tiring. And most people don't get it. But I'll finish off with this message is that life is absolute bullshit. But you should have to accept that and try and do whatever good you can do before you die. Because we're all gonna die someday anyways. We're all gonna fucking die. Don't worry, it's gonna come. If you wanna die, don't kill yourself. Just wait. Because you're gonna fucking die. Just try and get what good you can out of it. Especially while you're young. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna try and share this. So that anyone else that's struggling, I hope I really fucking hope that I can try and reach you. And tell you that like, hey man, we just gotta try. You know, we gotta keep trying and hope things get better. Maybe someday it'll give. And that's what I wanna do. I think I'm gonna make a lot of videos and stuff talking about things like this. Just try and make someone's day better as struggles with the same stuff. I have so much more I wanna say. But that's all I'll say for now, for another camera. But anyways, that's all. Thanks guys.",well-being
" I think I'm on my last thread. I'm like barely holding up. I feel like I'm losing my sanity and my sense of direction and goals and everything. I've been holding on for so long after graduating and suffering from the usual Gen Z bullshit right now being stuck at home and crazy and mentally ill and making parents that... I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. It's been like over two years. And then I think I'm just reaching my breaking point now. Today, I actually fucking sucked. It's just... I just... The world just fucking sucks. You know what I'm feeling? Like everything seems dim around you. Lights don't feel right. And you're just like tired because you don't get enough sleep or you just sleep too much. For me, I don't get enough sleep. I just sleep deprivation every single day. Even though I don't really have the pressure of like, you know, waking up early. But I go to sleep late and I try to... And then I try to make myself wake up early. Sorry, that was my car. Shut up car. But I just like go through the cycle every single day. And like I hate myself with scrolling. Like on TikTok or YouTube or whatever and bed until 3 a.m. And then I ask this at the same time. I want to force myself to wake up earlier. So I feel more productive. But then by the time it comes at 10 a.m. Like I wake up to my alarm. I press like snooze like 30 times. Like every 15 minutes the alarm goes off again, right? And then I just keep doing that until like... noon. So I wasted two hours and I still wasn't asleep. And I still wake up sleep deprived. And just like frustrating myself. What I've been doing for like the past few months. I don't know why. I mean, I know why. That's like a common signs depression. Like you only feel safe at night. That's how you like scrolling your active at night. It's like almost like manic mode. And then obviously you go on the cycle, right? When you do want to improve yourself. But you just can't... Because your body also doesn't... Even if you get up so your body still doesn't want to wake up really. You just want to avoid... Like having contact with your family. That's the case for me. But... I don't know if it's better or worse that I'm aware of this. Because either way I feel like shit. I feel like I'm too aware and makes me depressed. Like I know of... Just like the common patterns around me. The people around me like why they're acting like this. And it just makes me sad and like the life in shit. So like... Your life sucks. Like I just had a panic attack yesterday. And... That feeling of doom that I'm gonna die for sure. Holy shit dude. I haven't felt that feeling since like... I don't know I was a kid. To like my teenage years. I've been called. I felt that feeling way too many times. That is like a non-normal. To feel like you... At the end of the world. Like you're gonna die. You know that feeling. Especially over like dumbest things. Like oh I dropped this thing on the ground as dirty. Because my mom's a germa folks. She's gonna get mad at me. And she's gonna like punish me. You know? And just...or stuff like... I'm like, I'm gonna die. I'm like a retrospect right now. It doesn't fucking... For me. It doesn't fucking matter what college you want to. Yeah sure. I want to like a top 50 globally ranked school in Asia. Or just ranked worldwide. Like... So what? I can't find a job. It's like I went through all that shit for nothing. Go on with tangent again. But... I'm just recording right now for the sake of my sanity as well. This feels like my kind of like diary journal. Whatever you want to call it. I just can't write. My ADHD is like too shit from what I realized. So I'm gonna get diagnosed. But I've way too many like common patterns of it. But... I also noticed my speech compared to my healthiest years. When I was away from my parents. When I was studying for college. I've been studying like way more. Basically my confidence has just gone down. And I'm just like in my own fucking world. It's hard for me to interpret things correctly. Right now the only hope that I have is that... I know... If I'm at healthiest, I know there's a sense of hope. Because I was at the healthiest. And I know what's in store for me. But... If I were to say my current state right now, I'm no fucking hope. I probably just die. But I'm not choosing to kill myself. Because... I know... Of... That hope. That my healthiest version of me will tell them. Me in my current state. Yeah, life's fucking sucks basically. I just wanna rant.",well-being
" I don't know about you, but sometimes I just don't want to live because life is so stressful. It causes me a lot of mental pain, physical suffering, emotional suffering, etc. And the way life is being operated, you know, is a universal thing. Go to work, make money, pay your bills, achieve goals, be a slave, a modern day slave, to the job you work for. And to me, that's as bullshit because we'll some point of all that if it means in the end, we're all gonna die. We're gonna story ends one day for each and every single one of us. So what's the whole reasoning behind working hard, suffering, once again mentally and physically, emotionally? Rinse and repeat, right? Most people do this on a daily basis, if not, you know, five days a week, which pretty much is an everyday grind because on a weekend, when you have time off, right, you're probably spending one day having fun. And the next day you're prepping for work because it's right around the corner. And a few hours, you'll be back on the daily hustle again. So I like to question myself because I'm honest. Why the fuck do I want to live if I have to live like this? And I know it's just not me because once again, so we're a white thing, it exists all around the world. Across the globe, just about anywhere where life exists, right? But I question myself, why? What I want to live like this is not even a choice, either, which is this sad part because everybody's doing it. But just because everybody's doing it, it was a mean. It's the ideal way of living. It's the ideal way to go about life. I think it's fucking bullshit, I think it doesn't make any sense that I'm going to do all of this just to die in the end. Where's the appeal? How is that desirable? How am I living the American dream? You know, because I am from America. But the point is that's most people's dream. They just have a good job, get paid well to buy material, expense on material goods, right? Because a lot of people are materialistic. It's fine, you know, I'm not judging. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but we pretty much just work for money just so we can buy shit. And also spend it on meaningless stuff. And obviously pay bills, which is an necessity. There's no way around that. But I don't see how this is really living. Like I got through all this trouble. I got a work, work, work, work, work. Stress the fuck out. Until retirement day. It didn't have a few years left. Or several or a ton, right? Did you get my point? After you retire, you more likely are at age where you just want to rest because at that age of retirement, you know, you're pretty much beat up. And I don't agree with how we have to wait until retirement. I know we can start living because obviously we're still working full time. You don't have the time to do anything. So are we really living? If we're going to live a life that's unfulfilled because all we're doing is working, getting by, surviving, saving up, right? When in the end is like, you spent your whole fucking life doing that. And then you died. So as mentioned earlier, where is the appeal? How is that any form of being desirable? I'm going to die at the end of the day. I was the point of even doing anything. Yeah, it's pretty much what I'm trying to get at. What is the whole purpose of doing anything? When I'm going to just die, that I can't take nothing with me. I will no longer exist. I will no longer be aware of my thoughts. I will no longer care because I can't care anymore because I can't feel I can't think, can't do anything. So I don't, I don't get it. But to think about it, and to recap, this is what I'm understanding how life works. Here born, you become a workslave, you serve to whatever job you work for, then you die. Where is stuff fun in that? People say, oh, work hard. Prepare for the future. What fucking future? You fucking die at the end of the day. Excuse me, you fucking die in the end. So where's the, where's the reward, right? Because you're working hard for everything that you accomplish in life. So what good does it do for anybody? Really? Your work, you serve, you die. That's it. What's the point? What's the fucking point? It means absolutely nothing. Not the end of the day. What a story ends. I don't know. This is how I feel. Anyways, I'll make more videos that I have under stuff to talk about, which I'm pretty sure there are plenty of stuff to talk about. So, I'll end here.",well-being
" It's going on to Rome's raw real car rant. And so I came across a post on social and it was the sky. It goes around interviews, old people for lack of better term, the the olds. And basically like they go through like the number one piece of advice is always life is more than money. And as a young person, you're like man, that old person's full of poop, right? And all all this stuff about hustle culture, grind culture, you know, burdening the candle at both ends. It's really sexy and invoked right now. And also not to get into it, but with the economy the way it is. I feel like most people need like three jobs to get by anyways. But at the end of the day, they're right. And you know, I've been on this rock for 38 years and I've definitely been a part of grind culture as still currently in. And it just taking a step back and being thankful for what you have, you know, family, health, friends, you know, purpose in life. That really is all important. Now, you need money. Like money makes life easier. It gives you options. It gives you flexibility. It gives you opportunities. And it gives you kids opportunities. That's really important. But like I say, it's like the only people who remember when you work late is your kids. Right? And I know. So I'm very self-aware. Like I'm aware that I'm a narcissist. But also I'm aware that I am very bad at work life balance. And you know, trying to burn the candle at both ends and have multiple jobs and careers and also a grown and shown with this channel and cracking out mock draft 75.6. Like I'm fully aware that I have a very addictive personality and I've known it for a long time. That's why I'm very careful when it comes to drinking. I'm very careful because I know that maybe I like it too much. And that's a sign. Also, it's one of the reasons why I don't like I play some poker, sure. But one of the reasons why I don't like gamble in the pit like, well, play a little bit of crap to take that back. But like slot machines, slot machines, table games, I've seen people, even like people close to me like really ruin their lives by that. And I know myself with a addictive personality, gotta stay away from that. It's why I've never really gotten into hard drugs. Oh, sidebar. So when my father was dying of cancer, they had him on all these pain meds, right? And he had like a, all right. So you know, like one of those travel toiletry bags, which is you on zip it and go to to to to to to. He had one of those with like oxy cotton, oxy codone and for curiosity sake, I just tried an oxy one time and it was the first and only time I've ever tried oxy. I had a surgery in injuries and I've declined it because that one time that I tried it, I knew, you know, knowing my personality that this will be very, very bad. And also I mean, there's tons of stories out there about people getting addicted to paint kills, uh, painkillers. I mean, Ryan Leif is a prime example. He's made a recovery, uh, respect that. But I knew because it was like sunshine on my brain. I knew that. Also, do you ever meet someone that you're like really attracted to, but you know that this person will ruin your life? Yeah, it was like that with oxy cotton. I just like got to avoid that. What am I talking about? Oh, so it just slowing things down and just like making sure to take time for yourself and also your family. It's really important because, uh, so we got three kids and, you know, the wife and I were, we got away from having dinner at the table for like, for like a year, right? And something as simple as that because, you know, we're into watching, like our show, like we were watching Yellowstone or something like that. And so we'd have dinner on the couch and the kids would be watching their, uh, watching their Netflix show or Disney show or on the tablets, whatever, eating their friggin' ramen noodles because that's all that they want all the time. Hmm. But we recently, we just got back to eating dinner at the table and no electricity and electronics, no TV, no nothing. And it's something that I really value and I really cherish. And again, it's something small and it may seem trivial, but, you know, sitting down, you know, 20, 30 minutes, talking about your days, cracking jokes. So, uh, my middle kid, Rocco, like his thing right now is just, uh, so he's very aware that he's Asian, but he's half Asian, right? But he likes to make himself look as Asian as possible. So, uh, especially when he's, like, like he made a joke he tried before. He's so, he'll make one of his jokes like knock, knock, who's there? Potato, potato, who? Potato. Something like that. And then he'll just like, hmm. Ha ha ha. Uh, again, it seems silly, but it's amazing. Plus, the really into playing rock paper scissors right now, but it'll be like, rock paper scissors, nuke. They're just creating things. It's funny. It's funny, man. But, uh, I don't know, like, I know that I can definitely get into the weeds with work. I know that I can definitely get into the weeds with content, mock draft 79.2, but I don't know, like, I feel like there, there is a healthy balance like this weekend. There will be mercifully note. Well, so first off, I know that I definitely get a little bit too much into the weeds when it's like three in the morning. I have to get up at like six for, for something. And it's like, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm balls deep in the Dan Brugler beast reading about a priority free agent, uh, wide receiver. Joshua, Joshua, Seffis. He's going to be the one that takes us to the promised land. We have two seventh round picks. That's when he knows just like, okay, maybe she gets some sleep. Yeah. So I don't know, get some sleep, get some steps in, drink some water, everything in moderation, I don't know, I don't know, but yeah, I, so this weekend, like, one of my favorite things like having a picnic with the kids and whether it's going to be great and we're literally just going to make sandwiches and have some fruit and go out and kick the ball and it's good times. And I feel like it's very easy to get away from that, especially when you are in grind mode, especially if you have a lot of plates spinning and yeah, like I'm, I'm cognizant that I'm very bad at it and sometimes I need to improve on and I feel like at the end of the day, like we said, who's going to remember that you work late and just your kids? All right. So take time for yourself, take time for friends of family, take time for all that because I mean, work is work is work. It will always be there. And there always be time for another mock draft. I don't know what we accomplished, but it's beautiful Friday. What we call, it calls like philosophical Friday. It's probably pretty good. Anyways, you guys are the best here to do, Skull, no production value.",well-being
" I guess people are starting to wake up now. Hey guys, welcome back. Welcome back to the center. Welcome back to another video. Actually I came across a video yesterday and it was of a young man who was actually of Asian descent. I don't know if he was Chinese or not, but essentially he broke down into tears crying on his video as he was recalling some of the events of his life. And ultimately what it boiled down to is he realized that at the end of the day or at least his opinion was that no one cared. No one cared about him. No one cared about you. No one cared about anything except themselves. They only cared about how is everything going to benefit me? How are you going to benefit me? What can I take from you? And theoretically present this false projection of friendship where you within inversely believe that they would be there for you like you were there for them only to realize that if and when that moment comes they turn their back on you. They tell you no. They don't help you. They don't care about you. They reveal themselves. They show their hand in this sad and tragic life rant where he literally just bawled and broke out into tears as he almost was realizing this revelation real time on this video. Which I hate to say it. I don't want to make any generalizations. I don't want to make create any stereotypes. It is what it is. Folks, this is the world we live in. You know it. I know it. There are some folks out there that perhaps maybe you've had great relationships with that you still have great relationships with. And maybe there's some folks out there that you had great relationships with that you don't anymore because things change. People change. And the effect of the challenges that we face, the burden, the worry, the panic, the anxiety, the stress, the fear, the crisis, the problems, everything that's going on right now is affecting people differently. Cyber attacks, China attacking us or at least allegedly attacking us. And the possibility of World War III, the uncertainty of the jobs market, the risks that we all face financially in 2024 with the U.S. economy going down the toilet, the inability to ever buy an affordable home, ever again, inflation, recession, stock market crash, job loss, unemployment, election year, 2024. There is so much going on. It's unbelievable. It's unreal. And I also think that in watching this video and seeing this young man's reaction, very, very young, I think, but not going to lie, sometimes Chinese people, or not Chinese, just Asian people was kind of hard to tell. They age really well basically, which ironically there's actually a thing now where you can calculate your age. And now they're saying that people are aging slower. They're aging at a fraction of a percentage of the years that they've been on Earth on this life. So if you're 60 years old, but you're aging at a rate of 0.7%, or 70%, then theoretically then you'd be like 42 years old. It's weird how they do this math. But with that being said, as I read it, I was like, this is interesting because folks are trying to live longer. And then we're all at that, I guess, if you want to be here. But folks are trying to live longer. And unfortunately, those who are on social security and or banking on social security will understand and realize the problem that that would create with people living longer and drawing social security longer. Just saying. A little bit off topic. But with that, I think it comes, I think it does connect. I think it does relate from the standpoint of waking up. And this is not talking about being woke or woke movement or anything like that. Or if you saw Saturday night live with Adam Driver and who killed Han Solo. But either way, the simple fact of the matter is people are waking up. They're waking up and they're understanding and they're witnessing and accepting the truth and the reality of who people are or who people can be. Or what is happening or what is likely to happen next. They are waking up, which is good because I think once you begin to identify the problem, then you can begin to solve the problem. And it's literally like kind of going back to school and they would give you a word problem in math or whatever, whatever class it was. And you know, you kind of restate the problem in the answer. But in order to do that, you have to be able to identify the problem. So by seeing these videos and these young men having these monologue discussions and conversations on camera is showing me that we are actually progressing in a direction that could potentially prove to be positive and beneficial. In the long run, so long as it doesn't get suppressed or it doesn't get shadow banned or restricted or blocked or taken down or canceled or whatever, by whatever deep state operate operatives out there that ultimately wants to continuously tear down. Anyone or any group of people or organization trying to actually do some beneficial good for the overall greater good of society, mankind, the human race, however you want to describe it. And that's where we are today, folks. A little bit of a wake up call. I think you call it a life rant. I think it was a life rant, which you know, I don't want to just rant. I do want to try to provide some aid and information and education and help and support. And if you want to communicate, contact, feel free, reach out. I know a lot of people don't have people to talk to or perhaps maybe the people they do have to talk to aren't really listening to them. And I think that perhaps if you are a subscriber, if you have been watching for a while and you kind of have an idea who I am and who we are and what we do and how we think and how we feel. And just extending that offer to you, whereas if you do want someone to rant to about your life, then hey, we're all ears.",well-being
 Tell someone life sucks and they immediately become in repair mode and try to fix you or try to fix themselves and say no life doesn't suck how can you say that that's so negative and you're castigated you feel like oh you are an outsider looking into a world that can be discovered beyond happy smiley faces. When you embrace that life sucks stuff goes wrong all the time things break down relationships you get your heart broken you lose jobs you have money struggles the world's at war people always fight they gossip they lie if you go in with that attitude that life sucks it's so contradictory to the way we've been conditioned the way we be conditioned is be happy if you for example if someone asks how you're doing usually they don't care when they ask how you're doing that condition responses oh I'm wonderful I'm great I'm fabulous I'm doing well I'm good thanks for asking I love to say yeah I'm terrible I'm doing really really horrible and the see people's reaction what really what happened what's wrong what's the problem is there anything I could do to help it's like we automatically want to fix ourselves we cannot tolerate being unhappy because we have this expectation that we're supposed to be happy that life's supposed to be great that we're supposed to be successful that we're supposed to have the right job the right relationship the right house the right partner and this is just not the way life works so what we do is we spend all our lives rearranging all the puzzle pieces pieces to make us happy and boom falling on their face boom get bumped boom get arrows in the heart boom get punched get dad get daggers in our back and then we can't understand why we are not happy and it's this constant treadmill approach I need to be happy okay I'm going to be happy this is what I have to do happy I'll read this book or I'll talk to this person or I'll make this change so that's the very complex complement a complicated way of trying to be happy it's like trying to juggle tennis balls or knives or swords and each you know every hour someone adds another sword another sword and you're constantly trying to juggle and make everything work when you go in to life it's like going into a movie the moment someone tells me a movie this is the greatest movie it's fantastic you love it yeah it's amazing and you think oh my gosh I can't wait to see this movie and your expectations are way up here and you go and you see the movie and you're like oh my god that was terrible but if you go in a movie that you let's say you're a girlfriend your boyfriend or your wife or spouse dragged you into and everyone said this movie stinks this movie you're not going to like it it's dumb it's corny it has no plot the acting horrible your expectations are so low that you might actually enjoy the movie that's not going to win Academy where do you mean you're not it's you're not going to love it you probably won't see it again but the chance of you enjoying it is going to be a lot greater what shifted the movie was still the same what shifted is your intention attitude and approach and expectation more importantly before you go when you went and see this movie well life is the same way life sucks get used to it except it there's drama people are complaining all the time it's not it's not a picnic and you want to know what the good news is is the good news is we would have it no other way why do you think we love the news we love negative news that's why they're always showing violence and murders and war on TV because believe me if good news reported good news uplifting stories positive things that people getting along people helping out and volunteering for each other if that got ratings and made money it would be on TV all the time but we love challenge struggle when things go wrong we don't like when things always go our way in the matrix they had a great scene when they talked about how they originally did the computer programming when they had all the people plugged into the matrix the first program was everything was perfect smooth love peace happiness enjoy everybody got along and all the pods all the humans died there's something deep within us that needs that turmoil the struggle the challenge it like refines us and helps us grow but yet at the same on the on one hand we need that on the other hand we resist it and it's not the problems that causes to suffer the challenges those are can be blessings in the skies what causes us to suffer is our resistance to it i shouldn't feel like that we're like we're like little kids all grown up in adult bodies spoiled little brats i can't believe that person said this to me i can't believe i didn't get the job oh my god what's gonna happen this person doesn't like me uh things aren't going my way and we're constantly in that that friction mode friction friction and we blame the problems we blame life instead of looking in the mirror and saying what is my approach what is my approach what is my expectation am i expecting these things to work out because if you are you're a fool you're you're you're and you're up so you're fooling yourself and you're creating your own suffering so when you say okay life sucks get over it and then you can move on and then you go in it's like going into a movie with low expectations you don't have these expectations a plan other people you don't have these high perfectionist expectations upon yourself you don't have expectations upon your job it's you're not trying to extract your happiness externally because you realize everything you need resides within and as within so without so and most people live their entire lives reverse in a chaotic world where there's continuous problems and then they can't understand why they're unhappy and we always think that next carrot if I could only get this that will make me happy and it's this constant walking and bumping into walls so freedom liberation is realizing our true nature getting centered and saying you know if you if it's meditation works for you if it's stillness just something magical about stillness just being still and we claiming your energy and going within and then you realize hmm man despite the chaos outside outside in the real world everything's cool everything's legit everything's a okay and then you're not reactionary right now most people live their lives reactionary oh this person did this to me you know just constant constant suffering that we that self created so man that's great news life sucks life sucks and in that you bring different energy to challenges and when things go wrong you learn you grow you prosper when things go wrong because when life doesn't go your way it reveals your true character it reveals your true nature it reveals your weaknesses it reveals your strengths and it tells you what your homework is and normally we blame other people other situations for unhappiness instead of saying hmm I'm unhappy about this and that is my assignment that is my homework I have to do some self examination some stillness meditation whatever it is we center myself and find out why I am tossed like a read in the wind based on what happens externally oh man when you know life sucks and that there's just tremendous suffering in the world you can be at peace because you're loving things as they are and there's this you're putting out the fire of resistance and enjoy it it's a it's a joy ride once you get on it and once you start becoming a conscious of how often we are in resistance mode and we have this false ideal that life is supposed to be grandiose we're supposed to be life is supposed to make us happy we're supposed to be successful we're supposed to be excellent at things we do we're supposed to have people like us have money in the bank once you say oh man no all that's just all we've been conditioned we've been conditioned to believe all that so we keep on chasing this the the illusion the imaginary carrot that we doesn't doesn't go with us when we die and it's so temporary and let's return to what is real what is important and that's just going in we're finding your true nature connecting to your intuition your inner compass and then having the courage to live accordingly,well-being
" So today I want to talk about how life is so meaningless that nothing matters. So then we get to these slums of not wanting to do anything because we feel like nothing matters. But you are correct. I don't want to be like pessimistic in any way but I'm going to be because that's who I actually am. So you know, we go through life hoping that there's some sort of meaning. This is really funny story. I did an exam to get into film school once. We are talking about life. That's weird. And it is like this really random question about technology. And then I just went on a whole rant about how life is meaningless and we are just trying to do everything we can to grasp some sort of meaning because ultimately the feeling of having no meaning scares us because we're taught that meaning is everything. In the question schools, like, oh, you have to put meaning to this sentence that Shakespeare said, you have to put meaning. There is something behind. You have to read between the lines and whatever because we're always searching for meaning. But meaning doesn't exist. I'm sorry to say, but meaning does not exist. So what is there? Most times when I think about that, then I don't want to do anything for life. I'm like, oh, I have so many talents. Yeah, but at the same time, I don't want to profit off of them because I mean, I don't want to do them because then I'm always thinking about how I can profit off of my talents. And then that doesn't make it fun because I hate the idea of money. And then I am doing anything. You guys do that? I don't know. So I just sit in bed all day because I'm like, this is so pointless. But then when I think about dying, I get sad. And I get scared. And I'm like, oh, I want to have a long life. But then if I have to live, then I have to have a profit, unfortunately. So it's just a constant battle. I feel like we go through life in constant fear and constant stress because that's what we're taught in the beginning. See life for what it is and not for what it isn't or the solution that we created in order for us to feel like we have some sense of purpose. And it matters in the physical world, obviously. But once we die, we just kind of become energy again and disperse and become something else. And yeah, we can spend our whole lives stressing and freaking out and having everything that we've ever wanted and people always talking about. Can money buy happiness or is it can happiness not be bought? And then there's the side where people are like, yeah, money can buy happiness because it can buy you the things that you want that will make and that will make you happy. But people will understand, like, that's just temporary happiness. So long ago, I thought you said that. The big word that we forget basically is temporary. We know that things are temporary, but we try to make them permanent everything. We know that we meet the things in our life. We fight for things even if they're bad for us because we don't like to know what life is like without the things that we're comfortable with. Let's say somebody who grew up in a more wealthy family, right? And then they just lose all their money. And they have to try to live and survive on their own. It's going to feel very unknown and very scary to them. People don't do that intentionally. It's like the last resort that comes to them based on other circumstances. And then they're like, okay, I have to do this. But people don't do that intentionally because they don't want to leave behind that comfortable feeling. So you can see that face in the tree. That's so cute. Love you. And we get so comfortable with our lives and what's going on in them that even thinking about change is scary to us and we keep telling ourselves things like find where I am and find where I am or we say things like, oh, I can never be able to do that. But it's literally just your fear talking because you can get up one morning and throw all your money and just see how life takes you. You know what I mean? I'm not saying to do that. I'm just saying, you can. But you're choosing not to. Like the more you talk about your risk factors, the more you're going to put fear into yourself. And fear is the biggest block between you and this temporary reality because the fear makes you feel like this reality is permanent. What I'm trying to say is just live it. And there's this one song from this artist named Stokel. Something we might be dead by tomorrow, I think. And it's so true. Life is so unexpected. Anything can happen to you. So why are we sitting here with so much regret and so much pain and so much stress in our lives that kills us faster than life itself? Ah, peace it. Peace it out, man. Anyways, that's my little rant for the day. Or a little nature talk for today. Now let's go for some nature together and I'll show you the amazing things that it has to offer. Peace on the stream.",well-being
I don't really know how to start this video because I don't know I just feel weird about doing it I guess like I'm like why am I doing this this is so pointless but at the same time ever since yesterday when I decided to do a video every day for 30 days I feel like it actually gave me something to I don't know it gave me accountability I guess to do the things that might help [Music] me uh I hope the rain is not too loud I'm not actually going anywhere I just I didn't leave the house today so I thought I would I don't know park somewhere and film a video I don't know um so today I feel sad which is a step up from depression so that's a a really good good thing I know that like there's a vibrational scale of how you move and you're not going to go from depression to happy so I have to accept um the small movements and being sad today is a good thing because I mean you can clearly see I'm doing a little bit better because I'm able to get through this video without crying which is almost impossible before and I feel better because because I made goals to achieve every day so I feel like there's a reason to live now it's not a great reason like it it doesn't get me up and excited in the morning or anything like that but at least something but right now like my thoughts are what's the point to do all of this maybe I won't be depressed and suicidal but I'll be bad doesn't really seem like much of a point but I don't really have much of an option right so and this morning I woke up feeling a little bit better it was really nice out and sunny and hot and I went for a walk and that's all I did today my mom wanted me to come over but she always wants me to come over and I always say no maybe later cuz I don't know I can't bring myself to I know it's a problem so I'm going to try and go this week I'm also going to try and go to the gym at least once this week for like 10 minutes um the only thing that's really keeping me going is these videos and I don't really know why I care because I'm not really helping anyone I made YouTube to help people but instead of me helping people I'm using it for you guys to help me it's just not what I planned I don't know I guess I didn't even want to make this video but I said I would and I have to follow through on you know something and yeah I feel sad I feel depressed I am don't really feel like life is worth living but I do feel a step better than I did yesterday so thank you guys for watching and for commenting um without your comments there'd be no reason for me to make a video so see you tomorrow,well-being
hello guys so today is a very different type of video i'm not really spoken about this on my channel but it's to do with mental health more specifically my mental health now there's two reasons why i'm doing this video number one is for me apparently if you speak up about it it's good so i want to tell you guys i want to say what's on my mind and i just want to be honest number two hopefully this can motivate someone watching this uh who's going through something similar and hopefully it motivates them to speak up about it themselves okay um let me speak about what i'm going through and it's actually going on right now for some backstory i'm joe throughout my life i've always been a relatively insecure person and i think a lot of people know this i've always been in school about being skinny about having spots generally my appearance and while i've been insecure my whole life it's never affected me up here i've always been a happy kid i've never had any mental health problems i've always just loved life until like two or three months ago when things have just gone like that the last two or three months i have really started taking these insecurities and it's really been affecting my mood i get spots which every time i look in the mirror i'm disgusted by if i see my physique in bad lighting i'm disgusted by it and it's really started hitting me up here i will wear caps to stores to hide my face i will wear a hoodie to hide my body if i'm in a public place and i'm not gonna pump or anything i just constantly feel so stressed nowadays and i haven't really ever cried for so many years but like these past two or three months i've i've cried several times i just [ __ ] [ __ ] hate how i look and like i said i i've always been insecure always been insecure but it never affected me here and these last two or three months every single day i am sad [Music] i know that i'm not someone who's in a position to complain about their lives my life is [ __ ] amazing right now things i care about i'm the biggest i've ever been i'm about to hit a million subscribers on youtube which is my life i've got great mates i've got a great family i shouldn't be complaining i shouldn't be sad right now but for some reason i'm the [ __ ] worst i've ever been anyway in better news in regards to the situation i started speaking to people for about two months i just kept it to myself but last week i spoke to a mate about it that helped i went and spoke to my mum i told her about the situation speaking to my mum massively helped and honestly yeah take it from me while i'm nowhere near back to the happy joe like i was two or three months ago i know that would take time for me to get back to but i am much happier this past week since speaking about the situation just getting off my mind and that's a big reason why i'm doing this video now so i don't really know what i'm trying to say i will keep you guys updated um on how i'm feeling i just want to say coming from someone like me who knows how bad it can be mentally if you are feeling this way if you are having mental problems i know how hard it is and i know how much harder it is to go speak to people about it but please do anyone a close friend a stranger anyone getting off your chest is the best thing ever but yeah thank you guys,well-being
" One of the things that scares me the most in life is losing myself. I guess my interest as a child, like the dreams that I had, as a child, as a young adult, to lose those things, you know, I see almost all of the adults in my life at some point had to give up on their dreams, gave up on their dreams for money or most of the time it was for money or a career, but they just gave up. And I don't know if it's possible to go through life without losing yourself a little bit. You know, I understand that we evolve as humans as we go through life. You get better, you evolve, you become different. But it still pains me to think about losing myself like that. You know, one of my dreams is to buy some land and build a cabin on it. And, you know, I tell myself that I would never give up on that dream, but, and I won't. But, you know, those kinds of dreams, that's what I'm talking about. Those are the kinds of things that scare me. Like, spending the next 40 years at a job that I am only doing it for money. Like, that, that terrifies me or to stop traveling, to stop exploring, to stop spending time outside. Like, it seems like right now, whatever those things are for you, it seems like, you know, that's impossible. I would never lose myself. I would never sacrifice those things for comfort or just because I'm lazy. But I really think we would. Like, if you're a younger person and you still have those dreams and you haven't given up on them, protect them. Because you will, man, the world today just sucks the life out of adults. Like, when I, when I got my first job at a high school, I was working at Walmart. I worked there for about a year. And, you know, I was still, I was full of excitement. You know, I graduated high school. I was ready to start life, you know. I was full of life and, and, and ready for adventure. I was just excited to be alive, you know. Very much is I, I'm still that way today. I don't want to lose that. And that's the point, you know, when I went to that job for the first time. And I saw, you know, my managers, even so my coworkers that were five, 10 years older than me. And I just, like, people walk around like their zombies, you know. And I get it. That job sucks. But you can do something about it. Like part of the reason that I was so happy is because I knew Walmart wasn't my indestination. You know, I knew it was just a step in the, in getting to where I wanted to end up. Given I haven't gotten there yet, but that's how I treat every single thing. Like I'm still chasing that dream. And I think so many of these adults, you know, when you sacrifice everything for money, you no longer have dreams. I think that's why people walk around just emotional, emotionless, just like miserable. And it's because they have nothing left. Like they've sacrificed all of their dreams for money. And, you know, I just, I see that as one of the most tragic things in life. So, yeah, don't lose your younger self. Don't lose that part of you that wakes up every day excited for the adventure. That part of you that has dreams. Don't, don't sacrifice that for money or, or status. Because I mean, just look around you. It's not worth it. Like, yeah. Yeah. Don't sacrifice that part of yourself. So, yep. It's all gone for today. Talk soon.",well-being
" Shears the wee goby. Because we go, we'll not let me be great. We go to say no man, no man, we're not going to do it to yourself. And I love it. It's a good morning. Good morning, it's Sugar O'Connor. And I am back for what I eat in a day video. I just want to share with you guys what I eat in a day. On my video I saw this morning, ask for help because they say they get bored, they need suggestions, what to eat because that's their problem. They get bored with eating the same foods all the time. And I get it because I'm the same way. And I think that's one of the reasons why my weight loss is not consistent. Like, some people could lose three or four pounds every week because they eat the same stuff over and over. But that's not me. I get bored with food. If I eat the same thing maybe two days I'm done with it. That's why I don't really like the meal per. two people to comment and my last what I eat in a day vlog and they told me about this fair life milk because it gives you more protein than the regular milk because I used to do almond milk but my dietitian suggested I go back to regular milk because almond milk doesn't have a lot of nutritional value in it as far as protein on this journey we need the protein so I am so glad that the ladies told me about this fair life milk because the fat-free fair life milk it has zero fat it has six grams of carbs and 13 grams of protein I need that because the regular milk only have eight grams of protein it has way more carbs and this is apple strawberry Cheerios apple strawberry Cheerios so I'm gonna do a cup and a half that's my serving a cup and a half one cup half a cup now they'll say I'm grossing all out but I like to put ice in my cereal my ice I got a half a cup of raspberry y'all I like to put raspberry in my cereal too when about half banana then I'll do raspberry half a cup and they gives me extra fiber as well I'm gonna do one cup of a fair life milk so with this bowl of cereal and everything of course it's not a lot of protein so I'm gonna have one of those beats pickle eggs that I showed y'all that I made I'm just gonna eat one only one just one of them it's up to you you know how many you eat but I just feel one egg will be fine I'm gonna have one egg so I can have some extra pros and I want my protein to be over 20 20 grams seven grams of fiber 41.1 grams of carbs 6.5 grams of fat 22.9 grams of protein so just say 23 grams of protein now some people may say 21 that's a lot of carbs not for me my daily count according to my dietitian is 140 per day according to my doctor 130 per day so I just got to make sure I watch it for my next two meals and I already tracked my lunch what I'm going to have lunch because I had the same thing yesterday for lunch and I had it last night for dinner and I'm going to eat again today for lunch but I'm going to add something different to it and I'll share that with you when I come back I will be back it's 11.33 I started warming up my leftovers I took my lunch break today at 11.30 instead of 12 because your girl is hungry that's the only thing about when I don't eat around 35 40 grams of protein I get hungry faster for lunch time I did not have any snack at all and I've been trying not to snack until later in the day around two thirty three o'clockish with that being said right here is the brown rice this is the brown jasmine rice and this is a three-fourth cup I'm adding some cups from Dollar Tree these are the three-fourth cups and this right here is the half a cup so you can see the difference in the two to half a cup it's a lot smaller so I'm going to put it in here because you can't microwave these just all thing about these I'm going to put it in this bowl and then I'm going to put it in my microwave so heat up my brown rice so I like when it makes a little shape like this a little round shape and so I'm going to go ahead and warm everything up in a microwave for about 40 seconds and I'll be right back okay so I want to heat it the rice now what I'm going to do you guys I am going to bring over my okra intamatos that I cooked I cooked okra intamatos yesterday cut up onion in it and I um I added some uncle john's smoked sausage so what I'm going to do I'm going to serve a cup and a half of the okra tomatoes with the onions first by itself and then I'm going to measure my uncle john's sausage to make sure I'm getting just four ounces of sausage so let me do that real quick so this is the you come closer to the oven see me just the okra and tomatoes okra intamatos so now I'm going to have put my okra intamatos in here one cup and now I'm going to do a half a cup of this half a cup okra intamatos so I got one and a half cup of okra intamatos three four cups of jasmine brown rice now some people don't like stuff like this and this is one of these are a lot of people don't like to track because you got to separate your meat out and all that stuff I could have just you know put everything that's together and divide it by so many servings but it always don't work out that way and sometimes you track more than what you actually eat or you try less than what you actually eat so to make sure that I'm getting the right servings of everything I take my meat out when I do stuff like this so I'm gonna go ahead and turn this put them into it like this I'm gonna take this half a cup thing here let me turn it off I'm gonna put this on my smart way let me see if I can do it like this so yeah I can see it though sorry make others know us let me come down like this so you can see it okay so here's my smart way still and I'm gonna turn it on so it can zero it out with this on there okay and so I'm gonna put on units make sure I got it on ounces and pounds okay and pound it ounces so can you see it I can see it good so I want to do four ounces of sausage that's 1.2 you know I might just do what I got let's drink one too I think I'm gonna do one piece okay so what's that 3.6 ounces that was a silly and I'm gonna be full there you go four ounces oh I need one more okay so there's four ounces of umpajana sausage okay so now we have the three-fourth cup of brown rice it's just back to the up the scene and down okay so now we have the three-fourth cups of brown rice the one and one half cup of the Oakland tomatoes the four ounces of sausage now hoping I could eat all this y'all but I definitely had this yesterday for lunch now for dinner I did not eat as much I did only a half a cup of the rice and one cup of the Oakland tomatoes that in the evening I really eat a lot so I kind of you know scale back but I'm gonna put in here four ounces of shrimp I just cooked four ounces of shrimp I'm gonna add that just to give me a little bit more protein and I'm gonna splang to y'all so yesterday you guys I missed my protein go by seven I only had seven seventy three grams of protein yesterday my car since red on tray I had a hundred and thirty one cars because you know my doctor said I can have 130 cars my nutritionist said I can have it till 140 so the way I said it in my fitness pal when you put in the percentages it always kind of put it at 131 or 133 for some reason but it got it at 131 so I hit red at 131 but I went over on my fat by 27 that was because of the sausage the sausage got a lot of fat so I'm gonna make sure I don't eat this again later today which I won't so altogether this is 726 calories 48.2 grams of protein 33.5 grams of fat and 54.3 grams of carbs now when I look at my total for today so far for both of those meals it comes up to 71 grams of protein which means I still have nine more grams of protein to eat for today to hit my minimum goal total 95 grams of carbs that's why I said I'm not worried about that 54 grams of carbs because I still have more left my goal is a hundred and thirty four today according to my doctor 140 according to my dietitian but I try to always shoot towards the 130 so with that being said I still have what 30 plus another five I still have 34 grams of carbs for the first day so that's why I say don't get upset if you eat a lot of carbs in one meal just balance it out no because you don't go over your daily goal um fiber 13 grams of fiber so I still need 12 for today to hit my minimum and then for fat total is 40 I still have 10 more um left for today I would not be eating this meal again later so I don't have to worry about going over my fat like I did on yesterday but on yesterday I did really good um I had this meal twice yesterday however I did not eat the same portion size yesterday I didn't have any shrimp at all um what I did was I ate um one cup of the ochre tomatoes instead of a cup and a half and then I had um a half a cup of rice instead of three fourth cups of rice and I like I said I didn't have any shrimp so that's what I had for dinner on yesterday but I missed my goal by seven on my protein I even out my carbs I did 131 because that's what my fitness pal calculates for me is 131 when I put in the percentage rates I can never get that 130 every time I change my weight and I redo my calculation it never gets me that 130 I was putting me a few over 130 so again I hit daddy than at 131 on yesterday with the carbs my fiber it says that I had 22 grams of fiber out of 25 and then my fat I went over so I missed my fiber by three I missed my protein by seven and I went over my fat by 27 I went over big time yesterday that's because I ate the meal twice yesterday and that sausage has a lot of fat in it so but I'm okay because at the end of the day I do not eat my fitness extra points that I say I can eat my extra calories because according to my fitness pal on yesterday I was able if I wanted to eat 29 more calories from a five minute workout I did seven and I more calories from a 15 minute walk I did 481 calories from me doing my bicycle for 45 minutes yesterday so that kind of take care of me going over my fat by 27 and yesterday I did go over my calorie count by 57 I actually had 1557 yeah calories yesterday 1557 I went over about 57 and I'm okay I know I went over yesterday which is fine with me because yesterday I had some ice cream I had three fourth cups of the ice cream though I didn't eat a whole cup but yeah I went over my calories by 57 which was fine I didn't go to bed hungry I was fine and again all of the calories let's see 500 yeah so I couldn't eat it in an additional almost 600 calories according to my fitness pal but of course I'm under that is what it looks like ochre tomatoes onions and other giant sausage so good so good so good put some shrimp on here the shrimp hey y'all it's twine I'm back I tried to eat on my food and I couldn't eat it all so we go to be one let me be great oh my goodness so we go to be great now let me tell y'all I took the fill of me today today it's Friday I used to gonna take the Finch of Me on Fridays but I made up my mind that I was gonna try this week of taking my half a tablet finish every single day instead of doing three or four days like I normally do because I'm thinking that's the reason that my weight loss may have slowed down because I stopped doing a half a tablet every day and only mainly would do it like on Mondays and Tuesdays the days that I know that we go we kind of have this half life and it's time for me to re-give myself the next injection I know those of days that I really excuse me overeat like on Mondays and Tuesday so I really be needing to finish me on Mondays but I decided that I was gonna start taking the Finch of Me every day you know because Wednesday is like the first day of the week for me since that's my injection day and I actually took one Wednesday I took one yesterday Thursday and now I'm taking one today but it won't let me eat all this food I'm gonna let me eat it all I couldn't even drink all my food and this is a Dr. Pepper strawberry and cream zero sugar let me show you how much soda that though put in this glass oh so y'all can see it though I'm just gonna find some glass bowls and dishes so when I show you how food I can see stuff this is how much soda that look like a half a can probably about a half a can because that's what it feel like so I'm gonna finish sitting on my soda before it goes flat and let me show you how much food I have let me get um I still have let's see I still have two shrimp left one two sausage I got one two three four five pieces of sausage left and I know how much ochre and tomatoes let's measure this out and see I want to be on the money with this and this is the thing about this journey guys that we own you know sometimes you feel that you can't a lot in your mind tell you that but you'll be able to say we ain't doing that we did four ounces of sausage okay so that's zero let's put the sausage in there okay I'm getting all right some stuff on it one more piece of sausage in here that's one point five ounces y'all see that one point five ounces of sausage so I ate two point five you got one point five love okay so let's zero it out again let me turn it off so I can zero it out again turn it um okay my shrimp we got two love pieces of shrimp see how much that is okay so we ate three point three ounces in other shrimp because that's zero point seven ounces so yeah now let me see something here I wonder how much other other stuff I want to this one this is a one third cup serving here I'm going to see if that's how much rice and stuff we have left put this over here I'm gonna eat this later y'all I'm not throwing my food away this might be more than this might be a half a cup I'm gonna get a half a cup size thing I'm gonna put this rice ochre and tomato this little in here one whole half cup that's the thing about when you own this journey you can kind of look at when you measure in food you can kind of look at stuff and eyeball it until I look at it and I said the home is gonna be a little bit more than that so that's why I got the one half so I got one half cup of brown rice ochre and tomatoes left point seven of shrimp and what was that 1.5 of sausage left okay I like a way to cover on it I'll eat that later so yeah that's the thing about when you first take your injection you know that first day or two when you first take the wigovi you can kind of like you know eat you know all of your allow calories but then Friday Saturday and Sunday I told y'all sometimes I'm out of the eat like one meal you know and then I have maybe a snack and then a protein shape you know something like that because yeah but it's morning y'all saw I had the cereal and stuff and now that so that's gonna be my dinner y'all that's gonna be my dinner I'm telling you I'm gonna finish the rest of my doctor peple I just had to share that with y'all sometimes we think that we can eat a lot but always always two days out of that injection we over say I'm not gonna let you be great I'm stopping you so thorough and that's why I love taking my injection on Wednesday this is a proven fat y'all two days after like that doctor said that doctor on you too I gotta find him again so I can share him with y'all I'm gonna go back to look at one of my old videos so I can get it because I know I put his link of that video when he was saying that and one of my old videos when I first started this journey over a year ago but that doctor said do your injection on Wednesday because it takes about two days for you to really get the full effects of that medicine and that's when you need it to work for you the most is the weekends because the weekends is when people eat the most calories so when you take it on a Wednesday Friday Saturday Sunday it's stopping you honey I just showed you it just stopped wanting her tracks cheers to we go there because we go we're not let me be great mm-hmm we go to say no man no man we're not going to do it to yourself and I love it okay you guys I am back it is 3 27 3 27 I'm in the kitchen real quick gonna grab me a snack I told you out for some reason I always always crave something sweet around 3 3 30 so I'm gonna have one of these Clio yogurt bars they um strawberry vanilla I'm gonna take one of them out and I'm gonna have that um they both have eight grams of fat which is good because I told you I only have 10 more grams of fat today this is 16 carbs so it's gonna give me more carbs and this is a hundred and 60 calories for the vanilla 170 for strawberry I'm gonna do the vanilla so I pulled that one out first and yeah so this is running my meat they smacked so good usually Friday Saturday Sunday I do the don't even eat this time of the day after I get my snack in I do the thing I use to be done and if I do eat something it might be another little light snack or something like that 29 p.m. oh Siri but I'm gonna make sure I eat the rest of that food because I want to get the rest of my own protein and I don't want to waste you know shrimp and stuff that I actually cook so yeah this might be the end for me y'all because I use it don't really eat after I do my snack like I said if I do it used to be something to kind of put some extra protein in my body or something like that but yeah it's what I eat in the day if I eat something else then I'll record more for the video but if I don't be in the angle size that that wouldn't be my caloric intake for the day so I'm gonna go ahead and scan this real quick and see here's the thing when I scan this it came up to 140 versus what the box say I don't know my fitness pal always kind of be off sometime I don't know why so that being said that gives me a total of 80 grounds of protein 108 grounds of carbs for the whole day I did good I still have 23 carbs left fat that put me at 46 grounds of fat I still have four love which you know I'm not going to eat that fiber that put me at 14 grams of fiber so if anything I probably need to eat some fruit to get some more fiber in me if I do a whole cup of these it give me 82 protein 115 carbs 22 fiber 47 fats so that's good so I'm only short by three fiber and I still have 16 more carbs left I still have three more fat which I'm not gonna have so what I'm gonna end up doing I'm gonna drink some binoc fiber to give me those other three that I need my diet patients have to drink some binoc fiber or metal musa to give me a little bit extra fiber um that being said if I eat anything additional I will come back and I will add it to the tracker and I will come back in video but then I'm gonna try to get this video and with those of you who want to know I'm struggling what can I eat here's something and I will do more videos of these for you guys have a god bless day and enjoy your weekend",well-being
" Hi, I'm Ali and I've been in an aneroxie recovery for a few months now. If you follow me on TikTok, which you definitely could, you've probably seen this job before. This is my fear fruit jar filled with fear fruits and fruit challenges that I know I need to face in order to be fully recovered. If you don't know what a fear food is, it's a food that a person with an eating disorder fears or avoids completely. Not everyone with an eating disorder has fear foods and they can just be so individual from person to person. Lately I've been getting frustrated by how full this jar is and I'm finding new fear foods faster than I can eat them. So today I'll be challenging six fear foods, one at each meal on snack. Feel free to grab something to eat and we can eat together but with all that being said, we face the jar. On today's menu we've got ramen and milkshake filled biscuit bar food from the freezer section. I'm like mohon and grapes. I don't know what I was expecting from a day of fear food, but I'm scared. Okay, I'm going to plan up my day a little bit and I will see you at breakfast. I'll eat someone's excited for it. I haven't challenged any of them. I haven't challenged bacon or cheese and I've rarely challenged sauce. I don't know what I'd rate it. So appearance out of 10. I'm shaking. Honestly, it can't really taste the sauce. So kind of hoping they like, they've got it. I think they did. That just looks like cheese. I'm eating cheese. I'm eating cheese. The fact that my eating disorder was happy that they forgot the sauce means I have probably challenged that. Then you were improved. You deserve to add sauce to your food. Breakfast is done and that was also sauce and cheese and bacon. That probably wasn't quite enough for a full breakfast though. So I'm going to go get some wheat bits probably because meal endings and also fuel your body adequately. Breakfast, part two. Breakfast is done. I will see you at Morning Tea. It's morning tea time. I've got a mandarin, a protein bar and my grapes. I just wanted to take the opportunity as I'm sitting down with my grapes to reiterate the fact that eating disorders are not logical, they're not rational and they simply do not make sense. So I'm well aware that grapes are maybe a little bit of a ridiculous thing to be afraid of. My eating disorder doesn't care. So I also don't particularly feel like eating morning tea because I am not feeling great after breakfast. My brain is not very happy with me. It's just because it was later than usual. I'm not super hungry but you still need to feel your body. Doesn't matter when you last ate, if you're hungry, even if you're not, if you need to eat your plate. Honestly, how am I going to be scared of grapes? They're just like a small purple mandarin. One of the frustrating things about fear foods is you have to eat them over and over and over again until you're not scared of them anymore. You can't expect to just have it once and then be cured. I think I have to have protein bars every day for maybe two weeks before I stopped being so scared of them. If I had had it once and then not had it again, I think I would have gone back to being just as scared of it as I had been before I challenged it. So just keep challenging and it does get easier. One in tea. Done. I'll see you all later. It's lunchtime. Let's check another time. I think freezer foods scare me because they kind of feel like takeaway and my brain just equates like fast food with the weight gain. But that's so silly but like nothing bad is going to happen because it has another sponge. It's just another form of fuel which my body needs and your body needs the all-need fuel. love it's cured. The fact that I actively avoided having it means it's still a bit of food. Also, who is having nuggets without sauce anyway? Not me. I've been gaining weight consistently for the last few weeks and earlier this week I outgrew my favorite pair of jeans which has kind of contributed to pretty rough body image, which in turn makes eating more difficult. If the only way I can fit into a certain size of clothes is by restricting my food and mistreating my body, then it's not really the right size for me. Honestly, chicken nuggets and chocolate milk is like the perfect lunch. A lunch five year old mate would have been stoked with this. Lots of people in my comments on my TikTok purse was talking about how their family calls a clean plate a happy plate and I love that. So proud of my mum of the happy plate club. I'll see you at afternoon tea. It is once again time to eat. For afternoon tea I've got a yogurt and my filled biscuit ball. You know I'm wasting any of it. You're wasting any of it. Your buddy needs it all. I think the reason the biscuit scammy is because it's like you've got the biscuit. You've also got the filling. It's like two in one which my brain is like that's so unnecessary. I have the biscuit or just have the filling but you can't just have the filling. So that doesn't make sense. Open your eyes. I'm going to take away from her. It's just filled. It's not going to hurt. That is so good. Oh my gosh. It tastes so good. This is insane. That was such a good afternoon tea. I will see you at dinner. Fifth meal of the day. This one is kind of a big one. That smells so good. I have always really loved Japanese food. The guilt was really eating this afternoon. After afternoon tea. I really was not feeling dinner at all. I wasn't feeling this video at all. I was feeling pretty bad about my buddy image as well. But the thing is, sooner I gain weight, the sooner I get to return to normal life. And yes, that might be in a bigger body than I am in now. But that will be because it's the body I need to be in. I'm even disaughted that I don't get to eat my favorite fruits anymore. Where does that energy come up with that? Just what I would like to know. This is banging. And for some reason, I'm not allowed to have it. Like, sir, what if I gain weight? If I'm gaining weight, it's because I need to. I think people underestimate how exhausting recovery is as well. Because your body is working so hard to keep functioning and to gain weight if you need to. And to repair any damage that's been caused, it takes such a physical toll. But mentally, you're constantly fighting. This is like other half of you. And I wish people understood that recovery genuinely is a full-time job. You can't just give it 10% of your time and energy if you want to fully recover. You have to give it more than that. I was dreading that all day and I did it. I almost gave up off-dial for noontae. You know, you know how I'm done? Nobody needs to know that I was defeated by Roman. But I would have known. And I don't want to lose to a bowl of soup. Anyways, I'm off for some distraction before the guilt sets in. And I will see you at supper. Last meal of the day. Got the shake. This one is like near-polaritan flavor. Can't put a life on me decide if that means it's like three-flaming in one or if it's just one flavor. I'm going to say that's thickening off. That smells so good. That looks really thick too. That's just like drinking melted ice cream. I don't know why it's actually anything different. I actually do really struggle still with the good calories and feeling like they're a waste. But your body still uses other energy. So they're not a waste. One thing that's been really helpful for me to keep in mind is that as much as in that feel like it is, food is not the enemy. Your eating disorder is. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. So it's not you against the food. You and food are on the same side. Or you and your shakes. When you're recovering from eating disorder, food legitimately is your medicine. You will get your brain working again and get your brain to a place where it can fight back against your eating disorder. I just did a whole day of fear foods. Six. In recovery, you don't spend much time feeling proud of yourself. Your eating disorder doesn't let you feel proud of yourself. It just makes you feel bad. But you deserve to feel proud of yourself. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you. Your eating disorder is trying to kill you.",well-being
" Hey guys, welcome back or welcome to my channel, Valerina and home. I'm Jeanette Kakarika, I'm a soloist with the bearishest dance ballet in Munich, Germany. I recently got surgeries for appendicitis. So that's what I'm going to be talking about today. It's going to be a little bit vlog style, but I need to catch you guys up. I think that this video is going to be really beneficial for anybody who isn't necessarily dancer, but is athletic and is trying to figure out answers and trying to understand what's going on with their appendicitis or the pain that they're experiencing. And I just really couldn't find that kind of material when I was looking on the internet, except for like some marathon runners who were dead set on like running a marathon two weeks after their appendicitis. Just to start, there's two things. One is that I'm definitely not a medical professional and I'm definitely not giving medical advice. I'm going to be talking about my own experience. Two, the main point of this whole thing, and if you don't take anything else from this, it is just please, please, please take your pain seriously and if something isn't adding up when you're at the doctors, express that to them. Just make sure that you're communicating with your doctors as best you can. That was my biggest takeaway from this experience. All right, so I wrote it all down so that hopefully I don't miss anything. Basically, I had symptoms of appendicitis for a month before my surgery. Obviously, we're in coronavirus times and so I didn't have any expected performances during this time period. I also was dancing significantly less because after the Christmas holiday, we only came back for a very short time and then some dancers got sick and so they sent everybody home. I wasn't personally quarantined but I only came back after that for one day before my surgeries. So just to give a little context. Okay, so it all began with what I described at the time as a stomach ache. It was just really painful and it had me curled up for several days. I assumed at the time that it was maybe food poisoning because we had tried a new seafood place. The pain slowly started to go down my abdomen and into my lower abdominals and then this is what became known now as shooting pain, which I have said so many times, which was just straight down and I now know that that was my bladder. But I didn't understand that at the time and I kept describing this and trying to Google it and I wasn't getting a lot of answers. So I booked to go see the doctor because the pain just was continuing. At that point, I was thinking maybe it was a bladder infection, maybe it was my first one. I didn't have experience with that so I just I didn't know. And apparently it's very common in women. So the thing is right before my doctor's appointment, my symptoms started to get better. So then when I got there, we took a test and it did say that I did have a bladder infection. So then my doctor just took it for what it was and said, okay, this is what it is. She gave me medicine, of course, for this. Just like didn't really look anymore into it. Little did I know that the symptoms were going to come and go in waves for the next month. I now also know that actually appendicitis can cause, I mean, maybe that's not like the right medical term, but they can cause bladder infections as in it's not abnormal. So I went on this medicine for the bladder infection. My doctor, my general doctor also suggested that I go see a gynecologist. So I went to go see mine. And unfortunately before that, my symptoms had gotten worse again and then they got better. By the time I got see her now, my symptoms were better again, but I realized this was a pattern that things got worse and then better and then worse and then better. So I said that to her, but she basically just gave me like a natural herbal kind of medicine for post bladder infection. And speaking to my friends, I realized that none of this was very normal for a bladder infection. So I just kept googling, but I really couldn't find what the answer was. I really just had pain straight down. It wasn't on my right side. It was on my left side. I didn't really get what it was that I was feeling with the pain, but apparently that's the bladder. All of this dancing wasn't happening a lot, but when we were dancing, I was able to. It really depended on where and the way I was that I could do a lot of physical activity. We're not to a lot of physical activity. I also woke up then sometimes during the night from pain. And that's kind of when I was starting to realize that maybe this was serious. And then I actually didn't feel anything other than the shooting pain except for the night before my surgeries and I finally felt it on my right side. And it felt uncomfortable even to touch it. And I was like, oh my god, okay. I thought, well, maybe it's my appendix, but I really didn't know if this was going to be a surgery situation or what. I booked a doctor's appointment for the next afternoon. She tested for the infection again. I don't think she found anything. She also tested my blood. Wasn't going to come back until the next day anyway. And then she had me wait around for use of the ultrasound room. So she didn't ultrasound. She also had the other doctor there to look. But they couldn't really see much, but they realized it was abnormal. So they wanted to call to book me to see someone at a hospital for like intestinal stuff. But they were on a lunch break. So I left from there. I walked all the way back to work. I then walked to Starbucks. I got myself a tea. I got myself a bagel. I lunch and then I finally got a call from my doctor and she said, okay, yeah, go now. They can see you right now. I walked as fast as I could. So at this appointment, they took more blood and they did an ultrasound. But this time with the blood, they kept a little cap on it because they were like, well, in case we need more later. And I was like, what? The woman who did the ultrasound was like, there is some major swelling. You need to go see the surgeon now. What? I believe that day. I knew I was going to go see the doctor and I knew something was going to happen, but did I really think I was going to have surgery that day? Absolutely not. So I went to the surgeon and he was like, we're going to have to do surgery on you today. And he asked, like, did you eat today? And I said, yeah, I ate like an hour or two ago. And you're really not supposed to eat before surgery if you don't know that already. But I really didn't think I was getting surgery that day. So I thought it did not even cross my mind. And I was hungry and they were taking blood. So I didn't want to pass out, but they were like, we're doing it anyway. So at this point, I think it was like, probably for 430 in the afternoon. They took me straight up. They had me changing. They had me signing a bunch of stuff, translated all the English for me, but luckily the surgeons and all that they can speak English. Oh, also they had to take two really intense corona tests before I was admitted into the hospital. And not two, as in two and two horrible. They got all up in there. And so actually now that I've gone back to work and gotten a test at the feeder, I like can't complain because there's so much more gentle. So I was preparing for the surgery, like super fast. Let's do it. They're changing and I call my fiance in the bathroom because it was all happening so so fast. Oh, it wasn't going to be a lot of visitors because it's corona times. So that sucks. I went into surgery. Honestly, I don't remember much about waking up. By now it was like nighttime staff. I had been in surgery for like three hours. I think that they were saying that they're going to like, debrief me on how it all went the next morning because it was late and the surgeon was going home. And then I, I first was just uncomfortable, but I was like, it's fine. I'm on pain meds. It'll, you know, and I tried to like sit it out. I was like laying there and pain and then eventually it was way too much. And I was like, give me more medicine or something because I'm in so much pain. And apparently they took an ultrasound again, but I have no memory of this whatsoever. And they put me back into surgery because they realized I was still bleeding and that it was an abnormal case of appendicitis. I don't know what that means. But then I was in surgery for another three hours. And by the time I was out, it was like 4.30 in the morning. I accidentally texted my friend instead of my fiance that I was out and it was just like, garbled garbage and I accidentally took a selfie. So the next morning I was so lethargic, so tired, couldn't really move. It was like an effort just to like, move my arms. But that's what they were telling me is that I had to move. I had to move. Otherwise, I wasn't going to be allowed to leave the hospital. I remember two of the nurses forced me to get up and stand up and they wanted me to even walk around. And following that, I was in so much pain and it was not good. It turned out that there was sort of like a bladder situation that they had to resolve and then I was in a lot less pain because my bladder had been swollen and giving me pain and had been infected for a month. This was a symptom of appendicitis. So my appendix presumably had actually been swollen longer than that. Then that day, I think my general doctor called me to apologize. She said, I'm so sorry that we didn't do all the tests the first time. You know, please feel comfortable coming back. You know, she was like very apologetic and realized that we didn't do enough. The first time I came to her, you know, I have to say, although I don't want to like necessarily like blame myself for other patients, at the same time, I now realize that maybe my pain tolerance is slightly different. And I think also at the same time, we're very in tune with her bodies as dancers or athletes even. So if you really don't feel like something makes sense, which I didn't feel like it made sense when I first went to her, you should just speak up about it, especially with like a general doctor. She's not specialized in intestinal medicine. So it's better to speak up and demand more tests and then just be safe. Also the next day when I saw my surgeon, he also apologized to me because I didn't want to surgery twice. They didn't realize how complicated it was and they didn't know until they got in there. They'd actually put a drain in the first surgery. And then when I was complaining about the shooting pain, which was the same pain I said before the first surgery. So it doesn't make sense to me that it would be the drain. They took that out and then I was bleeding more. And are those things related? I don't know because I'm not a medical professional. All I know is what they tell me. The one thing that did help was that even though all I could do is like pretty much lay there. Eventually I was able to like raise the bed up so at least I was sort of laying in like a relaxed position. I could even put my feet up eventually to be sort of almost sitting on my own but with support. I would maybe turn on a yoga with a drain video. Even though I couldn't do absolutely everything, there was something very relaxing and calming about it and at least you know I could maybe do the arms up. I could maybe do like a small like the smallest twist you've ever done in your life and just like breathing exercises. Moving your arms and all that is so important. I was so swollen like my arms like none of this. And I would also say like trying to do breathing is really important. They were really nervous about that because I had been in surgery for six hours. They gave me a tube to make sure I still breathe. They actually had a machine for me to blow into to make sure I had the lung capacity to do so. It was quite funny. They also gave me a sheet on like doing like little feet exercises. But yeah, you'll feel better if you're able to like move even the smallest, smallest amount. And I knew I was better when I was finally able to stand. I wasn't able to stand upright because the back is quite flexible. The first time that I tried to stand up and be completely upright, I felt my back kind of go on me. I had had a laryscopic surgery which was the three points and although that's less invasive than having to be cut open, it is also three different points and then you know, you're going in and being quite small, being a dancer, they also had to put some gas in there to enlarge it. So all this stuff, my poor body had gone through. Oh. I basically just stayed in bed and got up a little bit, you know, to be allowed to shower, to go to the bathroom and stuff. So I was walking a little bit within our apartment and my fiance was taking care of me. Then I had to go back. I had to do the blood test and get the wounds checked a few days later. When I was at the hospital again, it was around lunchtime and I had been quite consistent with my meals and they took the blood, they checked my wounds. I was with my surgeon and I started to feel super lightheaded and I had not felt like that since I was like a preteen back forever ago and I had a need breakfast that day and I nearly passed out like the lights closed on me and that was the only time I had ever happened before in my life but I recognized it straight away and I was like, oh my god, I'm going to pass out. So I had to ask the surgeon if he had anything sugary and if I could have some water and luckily they did. They had some gummies so I ate the gummies, I felt instantly better but yeah, just take really good care of yourself and if you got to bring snacks. So the first week post surgery, I did basically absolutely nothing. I did just walking around in my apartment or walking to the doctors appointment and that was it. After the Chinese New Year actually, I started doing yoga that morning. Very, very, very simple and I did that every single day just to get a little bit of moving, just a little bit of twisting and to get some belly breathing. I also went out for walks because they say that after a appendicitis surgery, it's good to walk because that's a safe form of exercise and walking is actually very good form of exercise anyway. So I did that for two and a half weeks, almost three weeks and then I actually decided I felt good and I wanted to go on my bike very lightly, nothing fast, nothing crazy, no going up and down hills. That was also the week coming up on three weeks post surgery that I started finally doing some physiotherapy. Okay, I believe that's everything. So I'm going to let you catch up now on everything I've been doing. I'm so happy looking. I just got back from my general doctor appointment where I got some physical therapy written off through insurance, some extra physical therapy because the theater offers us so much. Fortunately, our budget has been cut and so that's one place where they're asking dancers to cut back. So I need to be able to do like twice a week or so to see acupuncture and to see a holistic kind of physical therapy, which has been so great. And even the difference between just a couple of days, between sessions has been so good. And tomorrow I'm going to go see the acupuncturist, but it's all just super, super gentle with a focus on like getting my organs healthy and running efficiently because that affects the whole body. And I'm really into that whole idea. I like Western and Eastern medicine together. Actually the guy that I am seeing for this physical therapy and who's kind of guiding me through it, he was a principal dancer here for a long time at the ballet. So I know that he knows what he's talking about. He has a lot of experience himself. So that's nice to be in good hands. I actually saw my surgeon yesterday also because I had to talk to him about some more testing that he wants me to do. I also spoke to him about extending my work leave because the amount of time was really for somebody who's going to go and sit at a desk, not a ballet dancer because I had read in one place that six to eight weeks recovery time is probably best for like heavy lifting and like difficult athletic work. But I mean you see so many different opinions, but that's why I really wanted to start vlogging. Even if this video is not like super helpful for a lot of people, maybe it's helpful for a few because I felt very lost. Anyway, I also spoke to both of them about how I'm feeling a little bit of discomfort. And it's not the same sort of sharp pain, but it's like a dull achy kind of in the bladder. Not a lot, but it happened a couple of times last week. That's one suggestion I have for anybody who's going through something similar or maybe not even so similar, but to write down how you feel like your symptoms and how things are going because it's so easy to forget. And I think it's good, especially in this situation where I clearly had some trouble understanding and they had misdiagnosed me basically. I think I want to be extra careful and like really know what I'm seeing and what I'm feeling and experiencing. And my general doctor said about this discomfort after doing more tests because she really wanted to be sure she took my blood again. She didn't ultrasound on me. She didn't see anything. There was no inflammation. So she said to me that it's very possible that it's scar tissue, but she said that very hesitantly and she said it saying that, you know, if this kind of thing worsens though, I have to tell her because she wants me to then go and get a scan at the hospital, which I really appreciate that she's working with me to make sure that whatever my pain threshold is that I get the right treatment for now on. Okay, that's it for now. Bye. Update, I've done some more tests following the recommendation of my surgeon and there's nothing glaringly wrong, but we're still waiting to hear back the official results. But it's still good news that there's nothing clearly wrong. I am increasing some movement. I'm hoping that maybe I can get some clearance to start maybe doing some Pilates and gerotonics and maybe some easy bar next week, but we're going to have to see what they think today. The people that I'm working with, they feel like things are going well and like flowing and like every week is making a pretty big difference. So this is good news. Hopefully we're coming to a little bit of an end with me being stuck at home. I would quite like to be a little more active soon. And this isn't just like the guilt talking because yes, I do have that, but I feel like I'm mature enough that I can compartmentalize that it's not like overwhelming my life. But I just miss like, I miss dancing. I miss dancing. I just miss dancing. Also I miss seeing my friends. Because as much as I am an introvert, like I need to see a couple of people sometimes, you know? Okay, I'm done talking to the camera. Bye. Okay, with log style, we're more casual now. Today is my first day to go and do some training. And by training, I mean, it's going to be very simple gyrotonics. And why gyrotonics? Because you're able to distribute the weight. With distributing the weight, you're able to focus a little bit more on what group, muscle group or area of the body you want to be working on. I might also talk a little bit about leg stability with my guy who helps us at the ballet. So I'm very lucky also to have to pay for this. And yeah, that's what I'll be doing today. Also an update that I am still as of yesterday, feeling that bladder aching again. Like I mentioned, I had started feeling that around three weeks post surgery. And it's dull. Actually, I'd say it's probably less pain than before. At this point, I'm not going to contact my doctor about it, but I'm actually supposed to see her next week anyway, because I need to get more physiotherapy credits through the insurance. So I'll be seeing her next week. Today, first, I'll be seeing physiotherapy. And then I'll go see the Pilates Gyrotonics guy. And we'll do a little bit of movement. Really, the focus for me is not on getting back into shape. It's on quality of movement and building blocks and having my body be healthy and not trying to go faster than I should. So with this in mind, let's do it. Final update is things are pretty good. I mean, I'm not 100%, but I feel like myself 95% of the day, I'm not even thinking about this. This final test has turned out to be pretty much fine. I just still have a little inflammation going on in organs nearby, which isn't surprising. Although this test was actually taken like three weeks ago, I did have a little bit of a drama trying to get this info. Oh well. Sorry for my makeup is a little wacky, but I did take class today. I've been doing some bar, just really simple, keeping my legs below 90, except to stretch. I can stretch to the front and to the side, but not to the back really. But I'm just keeping everything at 90. I'm also avoiding like really fast tendus because with tendus, when they're really fast, there's a lot of clenching and I don't want to be doing that. Opposition is really, really hard, so I'm not there yet to do center like that, which is good. That's fine with me. And I've been working on Pilates and yoga and gyrotonics is very, very helpful. I just actually filmed this video of one of my sessions yesterday. And it's helping to give me confidence and also more range of movement and to feel confident within that movement. I'm very lucky all of this happened when it did because not really missing out on anything. I don't really have to rush back either. I don't think it's a good idea. When I Google stuff, there's such a wide range of what they suggest. But you hear about like runners trying to do marathons. I heard of an ice hockey player who just three days after his surgery. I mean, supposedly he planned it with his doctor, but I mean mine was definitely not planned and it was quite complicated. But even so, he said, yeah, the doctor just said it was really going to hurt and it really, really did. And if an ice hockey player says that, I'm sure it did really, really hurt. But he said that he was fine. I don't know if I really believe that. I think we should be taking care of our bodies, especially as athletes. And I think we should be holding ourselves to higher standards personally. I don't know what he was playing, but if it was like for the Stanley Cup or something, I'd get it. But yeah, I'm just really grateful that like I don't feel the pressure to rush back. I did speak to some ex colleagues of mine who also had appendicitis and they also had bladder swelling. So they had a really similar experience as me. And one of them I know she took like nine weeks to come back to work, but she said it coordinated with their summer holiday. Kind of just talking to her about it made me feel a little better. If you made a today on this video, good for you and wow, you must be very interested. But I know that maybe it was a bit long, it was a bit rambly, but I just really wanted to give out some specific information to just like the few people who could really use it. It's okay if this is too long, I don't blame anybody. But hey, if you are all the way here, maybe you want to subscribe and please like the video. I do vlogs, I do ballet, I do DIY, and I do recipes and I have a couple of travel videos. Hopefully someday we can expand upon that. Future is looking bright. See you next time. Bye.",well-being
" Good morning everyone. Today what I thought I was going to do is film a what eat in a day, but I am on my period right now and having like not had periods for a long time and struggling with anorexia, dealing with that has been quite hard because I've had so many like cravings come up that I just haven't ever had before. Craving foods that my eating disorder told me for so long like I couldn't have or bad fuel weren't healthy and suddenly like knowing that I really fancy those foods was quite hard but this time around I'm doing really well with it. I'm doing very well with actually honoring what I want to eat and accepting that like okay I might be fancying things that like society says is like not healthy but it's healthy for me to eat that because I'm going against my eating disorder and also just because I'm giving my body what it wants and like as I always say a healthy relationship food is much healthier than a restrictive diet so you see so today is going to be a what eat in a day on my period honoring my cravings in a rectory recovery. I was also working around the three things I've got to do today which is go to college walk my dog with my friend and go to my boyfriend for the evening for dinner. Also one of my period I do get really bad body image which does come upon past with anorexia but especially when I'm on my period I just feel awful about my body so eating is then kind of even harder. Today I'm going to be overriding all of that eating what the hell I want I bring you along just to show you that actually you are allowed to eat what you want you're allowed to on your cravings. Let's go get breakfast. Full breakfast I have my mini chocolate wheat books and cup of tea and then after this I'll get something else because I know this one will fill me up. I feel like sometimes your lips are just fancy chocolate in the morning I'm definitely more of a sweet breakfast person. I pick sweet over savory any day. So I always have a part two of breakfast. Today I'm going to have a crumpet or I have a crumpet of spread and jam actually that sounds good. I love crumpets in the morning. I'm done and I think I'm full so I will see you at snack which will probably be early because I have college today. I'm going to put a welcome on my meals around it. It's hard to understand my health obviously. It's just food. Doesn't matter when you eat it it's all what you do and you have it regularly enough actually. I'm hungry again. It's only like and I run a hot off later but I do have to go to college in a minute anyway so I was going to get my snack. I just wanted to talk about the fact that like I like throughout my recovery I've really beat myself up for feeling hunger and my eating disorder has kind of told me that like me feeling hungry or me fancying things is me being greedy and like if you're in the same boat I just want to tell you that literally it is not greedy or gluttonous or you're going out of control or any of those things to want to eat food or to be hungry or to want specific things whether society says that like healthy or not it's not you being bad or greedy or wherever society is like drilled into us. Your body needs fuel and your body knows what it wants and if you fancy something then you are allowed to have it basically yeah I'm going to get some yogurt and some granola because my mum has made some granola and I have some vanilla yogurt in the fridge and my soot. I'm actually losing my mind my throat is sore so I'm going to go and eat yogurt because I think it will save my throat. You can see my lap desk that I've been working at on my bed. I mean I didn't finish work because I'm so studious. Let's go get a snack. I don't know what the hell I was just doing. I just walked around for like five minutes of the spoon of my mouth wondering where my spoon was. Right. Oh god I just sat on these foot. Sorry, it's the apple. I'm alone right now just munching my snack. I've got it with my own accord which if you've been following for a while you know I didn't ever really use to manage to do that. So I've actually got a lot better recently just being independent and being like you know what this is my recovery I've got to do for myself not relying on everyone 24-7. So that's great. I'm going to go get a granola. Such a solid snack and my mum makes incredible granola. I'll try to leave the recipe in the description if I can. Look at the size of that. How I should miss my mouth. Why did I try and put it in my mouth was shut. I think I'm getting a cold. My throat's kind of sore. It's croaky. I hate colds. I like an undirected level of annoying. Like what's the purpose of them really? Like what is the purpose? Like why? They're just irritating. Finished. That was really good. Now I've got to go to college and then come back in between to eat lunch and then go back to college and then I meet my friend for a walk and I go to my boyfriend's for dinner. So it's a busy day but that was very nice and I guess I'll see you at lunch. I just got back from college and I'm going to get lunch which is a bit early but I'm going back to college at half 12 for another lesson. So I do need to get it early and like I said earlier like timing does not matter. I used to focus so much on everything happened to be like at the exact time but honestly if you're eating when you're hungry or you're eating enough around what you're doing in the day then it does not matter. There's no rules to when you should or shouldn't eat. You can't eat too late and you can't eat too early. Like if you're hungry and you're eating then it's the right thing to do. I'm going to have some vegetarian moga tawny soup. I think I'm like butchered that as a name. Mum made like a big batch of it and then we like stuck in the fridge. So I'm just going to have some of that. She's going to microwave it. It's like it's kind of like curry soup. It's like loads of rice in it. It's really good. This won't be all I have obviously because that's not enough for lunch but um. I'm also weirdly craving less chocolate today which is interesting. I'm just rolling with it. I'll just eat what my body wants me to eat if I crave chocolate. I'll eat chocolate. I bet I'll crave chocolate tonight but yeah. This soup is really good. I'm very awesome and warm. That was really good. I just cannot figure out what the heck I want is a part two or you know the rest of my lunch. I need to get in there. What do I want? So fancy banana. Something else. Something sweet. Oh I'll show you what I found. Yeah. Oh yeah. What are these ones? Oh hey these or not? And the mint mariglanz. The mint mariglanz are literally incredible. You would not think they would be good but they taste like mint chocolate ice cream and a biscuit. Oh thank you mum. Mmm. Banana. It's really nice that I'm at a point where I'm just like food is food and I just need it when I need it. I'm just going to eat it. There's no question in my mind now like what do I fancy. It's lunchtime. What do I go for? The mint ones or the hazelnut ones? One of each. Mix it up. They're just weirdly really good. I genuinely don't get why. You're wrong. A little cream bits in them as well which probably isn't natural. There shouldn't work but they do. Oh yeah. Now I'm eating the chocolate everywhere. I'm so really happy. It's crazy chocolate. If you're craving something right now and you have it available this is your sign to eat it because cravings are not bad then. Crabings are very natural. Everyone gets cravings and you deserve to eat things that make you happy with it fancy and hazelnut ones as well. Mmm. It's weird. I thought I'd get like a nutella vibe from it but I'm not. Now I'll go to upper furtherment ones. Are you having any more? Or slap it my way. I don't know. I think I might still be slightly hungry. I have another biscuit. Also, so I can't really talk to this channel about like fact that it can be hard when you're in recovery to get your period back. Not hard to actually get it back but hard mentally knowing you've got it back. I know I really struggled with that because I was like oh no that means I'm healthy now. My brain obviously took me being healthy as like oh I must be fat and then because of my eating disorder I had like awful connotations of that so then I just felt really guilty and bad that I got it back but I think the way I got over that is like to realise that I want to have my period because I want my body to function and having my period means that it is doing what it needs to do in that sense and also means I can have children which is what I'd always wanted and I know that's not a motivation for everyone because not everyone does want kids. Oh my hoodie strings been like top right at the whole time but yeah just remember that actually it doesn't mean anything about your worth or your weight it just means that your body's doing what it needs to do. I'm still kind of hungry. Are you feeling biscuits? Yeah I might have another biscuit. You go for that one. Who cares about serving sizes? Not me. I think I'm good now. I will see you after new snack which I think might be in a cafe but we'll see because the weather's awful. I genuinely am scared for my camera's life right now. I don't want it to fall off. I am at boyfriend's house. I'm just having a little snack because I'm really really really hungry. Oh these two loops are already open. Do I have to be okay? I was really craving crisps. They're very much open and they soft. That's fine. I don't know if this is a bad idea. I already need salt. They're a bit soft. That filled a hole. I might still be hungry so I'm going to eat an apple. I will actually see you again. For dinner I have a burger. What is it? Southern fried chicken burger. A Southern fried chicken burger but a vegan one obviously and there's some chips and then salad. How did I just forget what salad was called? Whoo! A little challenge moment. Look at the size of the bun. That's a massive bun. All good, all good and the hood. I'm just going to go in there. It's not like I haven't eaten a burger before. I'm real hungry. After I've had a very productive day. That's actually really good. This is really good. I think it's so really good. Wow. I'm going to finish this and then I'll see you in a bit. Finished. Whoo! It's all good. It's just normal. It's just very normal. Eating a burger. Thank you. I will see you. That's snack. Good evening. It is evening snack time and I am craving chocolate. I'm going to be honest that I'm craving chocolate. Can you supply me with some chocolate? What do I want? I don't know. Happy mint arrow. Snack draw. This is the snack draw. Okay. This is little recovery snack draw This is the options. Oh, Oreos. Milky way. Snickers. Crunchy. Why do I just really talk to a double decker? I'm going to have a double decker. It's bad, bitch. I'm a fat. It's been actually a really good day. Actually, I've eaten very well. I've actually wanted my cravings a lot today. I've wanted more I've eaten more and now I have a double decker because chocolate is not bad. Chocolate is actually really good. Chocolate gives you serotonin, no? I do look like a bit of a state, but it's like 9pm. Why am I not doing my fingers? It's so early, man. I'm gonna put my body that fuel. They're so chewy. They're nice, though. I've went a long time about a double decker. It's a very tragic time in my life. I'm going to have a restricted decker take. Let's get some chocolate. They're so chewy. That was like perfect for like chocolate craving, though. What's that you feel different from those other chocolate? It's like chocolate new gar. New gar? Yeah. New gage? It's new gar. It's new gar. It's new. It's new. It's not new. It's not too early. I swear, but it's still new gar. Not hot nor. Nugget. Nugget. It's not Nugget, is it? It's new gar. Look at that. It's new gar. It's not gonna be new gar. Is it? I don't know if it isn't real. There it is. It's interesting. It would be new gar. There you go. Anyways, I'm gonna end the video here. I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope you have taken something from it and it's helped you realise that you are very much out on your cravings. Anyway, whatever you want, I've had a very good day. I've done very well. I am doing very well. I'm very happy at the minute. Have a very good time. Please like and subscribe if you haven't yet. And I will see you all soon. Good night!",well-being
" Hi! Guess who's back! So, I've been away from filming for maybe like the past month because I was so busy with uni. Right now we're having a breeding week which means I don't have uni. Well, I don't have to go to uni. And I'm at home and honestly all I'm craving is to do something creative, to stop thinking, stop using my brain and just like decorate my house, make art and so around myself with pretty things. Somebody is not feeling well today. Somebody is going to the vet today. Leo has injured his papa. I don't know how, so we're going to go to the vet later. I also have to decorate the rest, finish decorating the rest of our house. I don't know what to put in this area here. If anybody would like to suggest something to me, I would love that because I thought we were going to get some chairs. I was thinking to get two sort of leather chairs here, but it would just be decorative and it would not be functional and I want it to be functional. What I'm really supposed to be doing is finishing my essay. But I don't want to, I promise myself I would finish it today but I just, I can't, I want to not do this. Good morning. I'm getting ready to take my husband to get his first tattoo ever. I can't believe he finally decided to get a tattoo. I'm going to talk about something real quick before I head out. I have this kind of new perspective on anxiety, especially the social anxiety. When I started this series, I talked about the fear of being perceived, which was a term that I heard for the first time on TikTok actually. I relate to that a lot because when you have social anxiety, your anxiety becomes, comes from perception, from being seen, heard from others. What I recently realized is that there's even deeper layer to that onion, not fear of being perceived. Yes, there is a fear of perception, but behind fear there is shame. There is an incredible amount of shame that personally I carry just for existing. But I think something very common, if you've experienced childhood trauma, I think especially if you were neglected as a child, you're going to have some shame regarding your existence. I found working on this particular aspect of anxiety much easier than facing fear because it's easier to face your fear when you know what you're afraid of. It seems to have helped me really make a big bound ahead towards my healing. Especially because if you feel shame, you're going to feel other associated emotions that come with it, like for example, you don't have to feel like you deserve to be loved and praised and respected and so on. I think it's an important aspect to address. When I think of someone who carries shame, I immediately imagine someone who would have a posture which would have perhaps huts forward shoulders, someone who finds it difficult to maintain eye contact, someone who feels incredibly unsafe in the eyes of others, someone who may not put their own priorities and comfort ahead of others, like a people pleaser, someone who found it difficult to express their wants and likes, someone who's not in touch with their authenticity and who's not perhaps not even aware of what they like because they've spent their whole life adapting to others in order to feel safe, they're only able to live in the eyes of others. They're not able to connect with who they are, they can only be what the person in front of them wants them to be. So you have no taste, you have no opinion, you have no backbone, you're just whatever that person wants you to be because that's the only way you felt safe in the world. And it took me a long time to create boundaries, to figure out what are my likes, what is my comfort. It's still to this day, takes effort for me to, when someone is being toxic towards me, to not jump into a dessert that I probably did something wrong, yeah, to not like go into self-blame and take it as confirmation of my shame and of my negative self-talk. And someone is toxic around me that it just means that that person is toxic because there is absolutely no place in the world for someone being mean towards you, for someone being rude towards you, for someone disrespecting you, for someone making you feel uncomfortable, like those are all red flags for someone that you shouldn't be around. Or I thought, yeah, if someone is bringing negative feelings in me, that means I need to adapt more to that person. And I would stick around and do as much as I can to make that person like me and happy so that I feel safe rather than thinking that's not right, goodbye, which is what I would do now. It sounds so basic because you learn this stuff when you're a child at school, when you learn to socialise, but if you were abused as a child, you did not learn these things because your priority was not to learn to socialise, to be creative, to find your authentic self, your priority was just to survive, that was it, there was nothing else. And here we are now at 38 learning things that most people already know for decades. Yeah, today's bit. I think I'm going to wear this to you, kind of cute. Sometimes you kind of get hit with a bit of grief about the fact that you have to work hard at healing, while other people don't even have to think about hearing, while other people live their lives and do all the things that you're trying so hard to become normal at. This is what we're working with. Looks a bit messy. Is this cute? Do you think so, no? Are you doing to me? Are you doing to me? Yes, I like it. Very nice. Do you like what I did with my Gucci? Oh yes, nice. Yes, nice. It matches my shoes. Oh yes. Where you going? Come back. Where you going? Come back.",well-being
" When we talk about stress, we often think that it's caused by big life-changing events, but stress can also be caused by a buildup of small pressures in life. Waking up to a pile of dirty dishes the afternoon, seeing the junk mills slowly accumulate by the front door, always running out of printer ink and paper when we're in a time crunch to get something done. I know I might sound silly to stress over these seemingly meaningless situations, especially with everything that's going on in the world right now. But these non-stop strains of everyday life can add up. Until one day, it'll sneak up on us, and we won't be able to ignore it anymore. I've come to terms with the fact that some days will be more difficult than others, but that also doesn't mean that we need to give up, and just wait around until we start to feel the stress, take a toll on our emotional and physical well-being. I found that there are habits and systems that we can put into place to minimize these small stresses in life, because we all know that we don't need to add more things to our list of things to worry about. My first suggestion is to find a way to balance your day. Like everything in life, we need harmony, and this applies to how we spend our days as well. I noticed that I used to dedicate 80% of my time to work, and 20% for my personal life. No wonder I was always feeling burnt out. I had to find a way to rearrange my day to work less hours without feeling guilty or feeling like I was falling behind. I don't know if you guys can relate, but I noticed that I made up a lot of these arbitrary rules in my head. I mean, no one was telling me to work overtime or to reply to their emails as soon as possible, but it was out of habit, and over time it left me prioritizing work over everything else. Now I try to schedule my days and my weeks to reflect how I actually want to spend my time, because how we spend our days is how we spend our lives. This means scheduling meetings, but also date nights, family dinners, self-care days too, because what goes on my calendar gets dead. Of course, this is much more difficult if you don't have full control over your own schedule, but the least that we can do is to look at our calendar and find a day, or even just one hour of our day, to schedule some time to have fun, relax, and detach from our responsibilities. My second suggestion is to find mindful practices that work for you. When I decided to incorporate more mindfulness into my routine, I eased my way into it with five minute guided meditations, daily walks, journaling prompts to guide my writing. Well, these are great methods to help us to be more present. Now I know that mindfulness doesn't have to be a specific activity. It can be as simple as taking a moment to be mindful of the small, everyday pleasures. Maybe for you it's gardening, turning off your phone when you're eating, cuddling with your dog on your couch, or just taking a small break to listen to the rain. Whatever helps you to connect with the present moment, do it, and do it often throughout your day. These pockets of mindful moments act as a reminder for me, not to worry about the future, or to feel anxious about the past, but to pay attention to the life that's going on all around me. I am a perfectionist, not with everything I do, but I do have high standards for things I truly care about, and creating these YouTube videos is one of them. During the editing process, I find myself making endless little tweaks, going over the tiniest details that no one other than myself can probably notice in the final production. Making sure that the font is the right size, the skin tone is perfectly saturated, that the song transitions are seamless. While I don't think there's anything wrong with caring so much about what I produce, trying to live up to this unrealistic expectation week after week created an unnecessary stress to my life. It forced me to constantly look for mistakes, and I never felt quite satisfied. Having this mindset felt absolutely exhausting, and took the fun out of the creative process all together. I know it's just the perspective change, but now instead of looking for my flaws, I see my improvements and my growth. I even set a rule for myself that I will publish a video when it's 80% quote, perfect, and even if I make a mistake, it's okay because I can try again next week. One of the biggest reasons I get stressed is when I feel overwhelmed with everything I have to do. Too often I would feel anxious, procrastinate, and end up not doing anything at all. But I realized that a lot of this was due to not knowing how to properly manage my time, and not being able to get over the hurdle of just starting. This is why I find the five minute rule to be so effective, to get rid of the unnecessary everyday stress. I look at all the list of things I need to do, and decide which tasks need my uninterrupted attention, and which tasks I can tackle with the five minute rule. Five minutes doesn't sound intimidating, right? And I think that is why it's so effective. This is not about cramming more and more into our day, but it's a way to push through so that we have less things on our to-do list, and it takes a load off of her minds. So the next time you are feeling overwhelmed with your list of things to do, don't dwell on it. Just give yourself five minutes to start crossing off some things off of your list, and you'll be amazed at what you can do in such a short amount of time. Lately, when I find myself stressing over a situation, I started asking myself, is this something even within my control? That doesn't make the situation go away, but it has a powerful effect on easing my mind. The Stoics believe that we have very little to no control at all. We can't control what happens to us, what people say about us, other people's actions, the world and its problems, and if so, why are we more than willing to spend our time and our energy trying to solve it like it's our own problem? The more that I try to control everything around me, the more anxious I feel, and I don't want to go through life carrying this heavy feeling. Some try my best to accept that, some things will always be the way that they are, but what I can do is focus on what is in my control. I hope that you guys enjoyed today's video.

" In our free time, it's so easy to slip into doom scrolling, mindless browsing, binge-watching, or reaching for junk food. But what if we replace these habits with activities that genuinely make us feel good? I think in the busyness of life, we forget what really brings us joy and fall into habits that don't really serve us. This is where the dopamine menu comes in. A list of activities to lift us up during our downtime. The goal isn't to fill every moment with a task, but to help us avoid slipping back into those less fulfilling habits. By having an actual written list of our go-to activities, we can literally pick out what we need and make better choices. Jessica McCabe, the creator of this concept, explains it like this. It prevents us from going to the grocery store when we're hungry. So how do you create one? The menu has to be tailored to you. So the first thing is to make a list of all your favorite things. Then, like an actual menu, organize a list by starters, main course, dessert, or specials, depending on how much time and effort each activity takes. One only has three parts. I'll share with you my favorite go-to's and how it completely reshaped my daily routine. First starters. These are the small, quick activities that require minimal time and effort that can have a big impact on how you feel. Like making the bed, displaying fresh flowers, meditating, the list goes on. But I want to share with you my favorite three. I noticed that I tend to reach for my phone whenever I need a little break from whatever I'm doing. So I wanted to replace it with an activity that was a little more intentional. So when I have this urge, or should I say reflex, it's my cue to get up and make myself a herbal infusion instead. Instead of consuming more information, this is an actual break from my day, and I always feel refreshed afterwards. You know how they say to build good habits? We have to make it as easy as possible. Well, for me, it has made all the difference to leave my yoga mat laid out right next to my work desk. It's there as a reminder to do some light stretches and sometimes it even turns into a mini workout session. And afterwards, a little breathing exercise, taking just a few minutes to close my eyes and connect with my breath calms my nerves so much. Nothing resonates with us emotionally, quite like music. No matter what's going on in my life, no matter how hectic things get, listening to my favorite playlist can instantly winating my mood. I actually always have a pair of earbuds with me so that I can listen to it whenever I want to. I think it's because for that moment, I can tune everything out and reconnect with something that I love. Whether I'm in the car, cooking in the kitchen, or even in the shower, it works every time. And now we move on to the main course. The things that require more engagement, effort, and time, but also has a long lasting effect. First one for me is always to have a creative project. Our current creative project is to make all the art pieces for our home. It's rewarding to learn things along the way and also to display something that we made ourselves. I have a long list of things that I want to do next. Learn how to make throw cushions and even build small furniture pieces. Learning a slow skill is the best way to slow down and appreciate the gradual progress. Whether it's learning to play an instrument, baking from scratch, gardening or crocheting. For me right now, it is learning Portuguese. Of course, the best way is probably to go out there and interact with people, but the flashcards and games make it so much fun. And it's really easy to do when I have even just a couple of minutes to spare. Having healthy homemade snacks around is so crucial in my opinion, because obviously, this helps us make better food choices. I love looking up new recipes and making it is just as much as fun. I am obsessed with chia pudding right now and also these almond butter stuffed dates with the chocolate drizzle. It is so satisfying. The purpose of a sensory walk is to discover new sights and sounds. I love walking around the city in the late mornings or early afternoons because it's usually really peaceful. I also love bringing my camera along because it makes me pay attention to the things that I would usually overlook. Most of us have to be on our screens for a big chunk of the day, so going out, getting fresh air and discovering new things is the best way to reset our senses again. And then we have the specials, the activities that don't happen every day, but can make a big impact when they do. Maybe for you, it's going to see a play, a concert, volunteering or going out to a nice dinner. Two things that I've been loving lately. The first is a fashion show. Not going to see one, but having one. We get a dopamine hit from clicking that Buy Now button, which is why online shopping can be so addicting. But if I ever feel the urge to buy something, I'll go into my closet and just try on a whole of my clothes. I don't know if this is fun for anyone else, but I have a blast. It's also such a good way to appreciate what we have and create more outfit ideas. Okay, the aftermath is not so fun, but it's also a big motivator for not buying any more things. And of course on the list, my new favorite thing is exploring new parks in Lisbon. I love the parks here. They're so unique to the neighborhood, trees, the views, the energy is all so different. And we're starting at the parks closest to our home and working our way throughout the whole city. It always makes me think that we really don't need much at all to feel good. Sometimes just sitting quietly on the bench and watching life go by is all we need. I hope that this video inspired you to create your own menu. You'd be surprised how a few small changes in our day can make such a big difference. Thank you guys so much for watching and I'll talk to you very soon.",well-being
" I'm doing the best I can. I really want to make it. I'm working for the whole day. I'm working for the whole day. So, my parents have a 12 years age gap. Been major differences in their personalities. I'm not going to go into detail, but let's just say it hasn't been easy. Mom is super into healthy stuff. I like to enjoy some unhealthy food from time to time. But he has a height of form. I��터 a lot of time. I love to eat food. Hey, glad you're here. I'm Chloe. This is the story of me finding love and trying to figure out what that really means. that really means. You're all my life that met some people, but somehow never worked out. To be really honest, I'm starting to wonder if I'm the problem and being the common denominator. I don't think I grew up having a good idea of what an ideal relationship or marriage should look like. And still not quite sure even to have a stay. I don't know. What is love? What on earth truly matters in happy relationship and marriage? And how do you know someone is the one? Ever since you're home from looking at your parents, I started developing this life goal. I need to find a partner whom truly compatible with I want to find someone who I can connect with emotionally, intellectually and spiritually on all levels, also having a cancer with. I want to be able to chat about anything. I want to be able to be myself and all in love with the way that I am in an relationship. And I want that for the other person to us. But how where is that person to see even exist? I don't believe there's such thing as soul-made. I don't think there's someone perfect for me on theory there. But I want to know how close I can really get. You know, I mean it's a decision of a lifetime, isn't it? However, as time goes by, I'm starting to feel the clock ticking louder and louder as my friends are getting married and having kids. And then there's me. I don't know what to say. I think as I get older, it just gets harder and harder. I remember the good old times when dating gets to be easy. But now I don't know what happened to me. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever be able to find someone. Perhaps it's really time to take it more seriously. But meeting people is honestly so time-consuming and tiring. We don't have that much time to spare. We need to approach it more effectively. We need strategy. I'm ready. My wings drives me crazy. Dressing up, fixing my strife. Always prepared. You never know who. Show some for a raccoon. Maybe it's that director. Oh, I can sing. I can dance. I can learn the smooth moves. I will do anything you ask me to. Jump out on the stage. Get locked up in the cage. I read your. Glitter and it's such a glamour. Why not impress me? Show me your ring. I hate you. So I've been reading this book. How to not buy a loan. Buy a logonery who is the head of relationship science at hinge in a Harvard behavioral scientist. I started reading this book because personally, for a really long time, I thought dating is quite difficult. I think it used to be pretty easy, but the older I got, the more difficult has become. And I do believe that dating is a skill that can really change your lives. This book gave me some perspective on what a meaningful relationship is and what it's like to have a more healthy approach to dating. So top five tips that I found very helpful. Tip number one is know yourself. Finding all your dating blind spots. A lot of us actually have this pattern that may be hindering us finding a partner. And Logan, I demify it three types of data. One is the romanticizer. Second is the maximizer. And third is the hesitated. And the romanticizer loves love. These are the type of people who believe that they're so made. And they believe that there's this one person out there for them. And they just need to go out and look for this person. And once they find this person, loving and dating would just be so easy and effortless. And so when their inner relationship and things don't work out, they tend to think that it's because they're not with the right person and they'll just end things and go off on the journey of finding again. And the cycle just repeats. And the second type is the maximizer. I think personally I fall into this category. I want to know what you guys are. Hopefully not in these. But I think I'm the maximizer. So the maximizer are the ones who try to optimize their options. And they have unreal expectations of their partner. This is a kind of person who is always thinking, can I just be with someone that's just 5% hotter, just 5% smarter. So they're always wondering what else is out there, rather than fully committing into a relationship and making things work. And third is the hesitator. This is type of person who has unrealistic expectations of themselves. They feel like they're never really ready for a relationship and they'll say that I'll be ready to date. When I lose 10 pounds or I'll be ready to date when I have a more impressive job. So instead of getting out there and learning about dating and learning more about themselves, they're always waiting for the day to come where they're fully ready. Share in the comments and let me know if you identify yourself within you at least. I think I'm the maximizer. And tip number two. Throw away your checklist and forget about ideal type. You know the song I'm looking for a guy in finance, trust fund, 65, blue eyes. I think it's really interesting how we often ask others what is your ideal type? I used to think about this so seriously, but now I've come to realize that it doesn't really matter and they probably don't exist. Logan suggests that we should throw away our checklist because after we go on a date, we tend to prioritize things that are more on the service, things that are easier to measure such as appearance, height, status, over long-term qualities that are deeper and more long-lasting. However, these are actually the key to a happy and fulfilled relationship. So what are the qualities that truly matter in a happy and meaningful relationship? Instead of looking for a guy and trust fund finance, look for someone who is emotionally stable, someone who is kind, someone who has a growth mindset, and someone who can communicate well and fight well. So these are actually the qualities that really help the couple building in a relationship, nurture the deeper connections that help you weather the ups and downs of lives. Tip number three, don't fall into the interview trap. So I like what we talked about earlier, we really go into a date with a list of boxes to check. I'm trying to figure out if this person is worth my time and if there will be a second date. I'm not going to lie, I was definitely like that. Constantly evaluating rather than just being in the moment. So the problem with that is when you treat like an evaluation, it's easy to miss out on the spontaneous and genuine interactions that foster real chemistry, and for you to really get to know this person on a more genuine level. So instead of treating like an interview where you're focusing on the checklist, try to be present in the moment. I think that would just help both of you to relax better and be yourself. Stop focusing on what they look on paper, focus on how you feel around them. Tip number four, take the experiment to approach and get out of your comfort zone. So instead of just getting dinner, why not try doing activity together? Why not go do a new place together? Now just go and have fun and see if you vibe. I think this is especially true for me because as I get older, I notice that my checklists tend to get longer and longer. But at the end of the day, I think I can still be really happy with someone even if they don't check all the boxes. And so nowadays when I approach dating, I think I'm definitely more open-minded to meet all different kinds of people. And yeah, just really challenge my assumptions about what brings me through happiness. And try to avoid getting fixated on the sparks or love at first sight. Instead, try to embrace this concept that's mentioned in the book called Slow Burn. So Slow Burn means someone may not be particularly turning upon your first meeting, but would make a great long-term partner. Tip number five, this might be my favorite. Don't let perfect be the enemy of great. We often see people living in very envious life who has everything but are not happy. And we also see people who don't have much living a simple life and very content with what they have. And it's going to be thinking like, what is it that separates them? And I think the answer is the mindset. It's how we feel about it, rather than what it really is. When we're choosing a partner, I think it's impossible to just feel completely happy and satisfied by the choice itself. But rather, it's how we feel about that decision. Because you're never going to know what it's like dating everyone else. It's not a real issue to be bothered with. You can either constantly wonder what's potentially out there, but in that case, there will be more difficulty for you to feel happy. Or you can learn to appreciate the love and support that your partner is giving you. The bond and connection that you share. Life or things in general don't come with inherently. We create and assign our own means to them, your actions, thoughts and values. In fact, it's usually the investment into building something, till it nights, the artwork, perseverance, the imperfection that makes something so beautiful and meaningful. And that's greatness. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. When people talk until what you wanna hear now, But they all disappear, they will let you down. So we better stick together, It's come whatever we're not coming home tonight. What is love? I think I finally come to understand love a little better. It's commitment. And in a way, it also means settling. Love is a decision. A decision to settle. A decision to stay. A decision to give. A decision to trust and embrace. It's made up by a series of small choices we make every day. Every morning we wake up and we choose this person again and again. Even if someone better comes along. Even when things get hard. Perhaps this is what real love is. A simple, yet solid feeling. And the answer was never out there to be looked for. The answer was always been here within me. I need only you and this crazy girl. We got along.",well-being
" You don't really peeve me the freak off. Several things like slime and ASMR videos and other things that I'll go over with you. Give me the napkin. Is it still there? You still got it on. It's still there a little bit. Did I get it? No, there's still some. Yeah. All good? Yep. Perfect. Pet peeves. No matter how mundane, peeve you off. They just peeve you. I consider myself a go-at-the-flow kind of guy, but sometimes there's things. There's just a couple things that really peeve me off. I don't know if anybody else is with me on this because it seems to be a very popular thing. But one of the top things that gets my goat, slime. It's kind of razz- my eyes a little bit. When I was younger, I got a gift and because I am a boy, it's slime. You know, you get boys, gross bugs, bleh, make a bug from the thing, da-da-da-da-da-da-da. I fell into that category and so I was gifted slime one day and I played with it for like, I don't know, a little bit. And not even after a minute or two of playing with it, my hands were filled with like this weird texture. It was like an oily texture. Whatever else I was touching was also getting oily. And then the slime itself was attracting all kinds of hair and dust. It was disgusting. And it was like two minutes. I don't want to play anymore. And now I can't stand slime. When I see people make those satisfying slime videos, it just throws me into a deep, terrible rage. Anytime I see it, I just think of like sticky hair and oily texture. I don't know what's going on my brain that makes me mad, but when I see it, it makes me mad. I get angry. I don't like slime. And the threads. And more of a moon sand kind of guy anyway. Is it not just the better of the two? Would you rather play with soft, silky beach-like sand or icky, oily, gross, sticky, booger, snot toy? Something wrong with your kid. Anyway, moving on. I'm glad that we can all agree that I'm right. Next up is ASMR. I get it. There are some people that listen to it and they love it. The sound goes in into the brain and it gives it a little tickle and it makes them feel good. So for some reason, it feels the opposite for me. Oh! Stop it! You think it's like a personal space thing. ASMR makes it feel like somebody's right up in my bubble. And I don't like that. I like my personal space. I like me a good amount of air between me and people. Don't touch me. If I'm on a plane and your legs are touching my legs, I won't say anything because I'm pretty non-confrontational, but I'll be upset about it. Next up on the list, a pet peeve I think everybody can agree on. This video is sponsored by NordVPN. You know what you do at NordVPN is a virtual private network that keeps you safe online.

There's another thing that peeps me off that I'm tired of being quiet about and something needs to be said. One moment. Look at these two burgers. Observe how easy it is to eat this regular-sized normal burger. See? Relatively easy. Not dry this. It's messy. It's bigger than your mouth. It falls apart easily. Isn't it the worst? It's okay. I've been there, buddy. I don't like food that I physically have to crush with my hands to be able to eat it. I think there should be a law that prohibits burgers from being bigger than the average human mouth size, which is about 2.2 inches, which is around the width of three human fingers. Take your fingers out of your mouth. You'll be excited to eat a hot dog that required you to unhinge your mouth to eat? I don't think so. I think the rule of thumb is if your burger needs a stick to stay together, maybe it's time to go back to the drawing board. People who say short instead of average height, like people are tall or short, and somehow there's no room for average. What you're always hot or cold and there's no warm, faster, slow, full or hungry, day or night is your world so rigid that you are bound by the rule of black and white. Will you give no time for the brilliance of the sunsets of dance and the stage of the horizon? I'm 5'9 and that's short to you! It's average. Imagine what house you could build with hundreds of millions of dollars. Beautiful marble, gargist statues, water features, with that much money you should be able to make something really amazing with a lot of good taste. Well, I found a place that's somehow the opposite. I was on Zillow trying to find the most expensive place to live in New York. No, I am not procrastinating. It's important. Research. Anyway, I found this one. Look at how unfinished it looks. It looks bad. Can you guess how much this mansion costs? $125 million. Isn't that insane? You know, like wood at Home Depot that's like not finished or part of any complete project? That's what this place looks like. It's like a table where you got all the parts but never finished them. I'm not mad that the house looks bad. I'm mad that the house looks this bad with so much money behind it. How can you be so rich and make such a bad interior? It's offensive. Cough! Let's put this into perspective. Rich people can buy crazy things like F1 fighter jets and race tracks and probably a scrying orb. But then they go and get this. It just doesn't add up and it makes me pretty mad. Like if you're gonna have a bad house, it should at least be cheap. Or it's like spending millions of dollars on a party on the moon and then you bring out the dessert and it's yogurt. Just plain yogurt. Why ruin the million dollar party? With yogurt. I can only assume whoever owns this house just wanted to feel something. They've experienced so much opulent and extravagance that this disgusting violent interior is the only thing that's made them feel anything in years. Next up, the craft mac and cheese boxes. Bring it exhibit A. As you can see here, there is a nice perforated edge designed for the user to easily access the mac and cheese and cheese dust within. Perfect. It will make opening it so much easier. Except it doesn't. And every time I want a bowl of mac and I'm just crushing the box and I feel stupid. Okay, here I go. Perfect. It's so incredibly pointless. I'm having a hard time believing it's a real machine making these perforated edges. Probably just a guy at the end of the production line making indents in the boxes with his fingernails because he thinks it's like helpful or something. What is it? Even if it was. There's an entire bag of cheese dust in there that needs to be extracted. It's not gonna fit through that tiny hole. Just copy cereal boxes. They figured it out and you could do the same thing. Probably. No. There's this thing that gets my goat so bad when I'm on a walk with Ria and we're having a great time of taking in the nature. She's sniffing around. We come across a lawn that she's already been walking in with a tiny little usually green sign that says this lawn has been completely treated. Keep children at pets off until dry. Why is that sign so small? Tiny. Clearly the chemical that is treating the lawn is harmful to pets and children. Otherwise why would there be a sign? So when something is harmful, why is the sign so tiny? To still contradiction, it never, like why is it also green which blends into the grass? The issue arises when I don't notice it until Ria's already been in the lawn sniffing around. Clearly the solution is to have several signs, have a little skull and crossbones on it and then like string together some pink string between each sign surrounding the treating area. Imagine you had to store some nuclear waste from a nuclear power plant. But we need to keep this away from the public. It's harmful nuclear waste. So what should we do? I have just the plan. It's perfect. If I were to give you a vial of poison and say drink it, would you probably not. But then if I said, oh don't worry, it's only enough to kill small children and pets. Would you feel safe drinking it then? Probably not. Just hate those signs. Huh. I'm watching. And don't forget to subscribe. If you don't subscribe, it'll make me mad. You will like it when I'm mad. Huh. Huh. Huh.",well-being
" Good evening, bro. Step number one, as always, take your phone and put it away. Make this a 101 conversation between you and me or you maintain eye contact and focus the whole time. My name is Stefan Lathish or Stefan Lathish in English. I was born in Romania in 2006 and I moved to Canada in 2010 and I've been living here ever since. Let's get to it. Today I'm wearing the bathroom, I just showered some of my hair a little bit wet. Although my back's gonna get hot because it's on the way to the seat. I think you may have noticed that if you look through my older videos that like my face was pretty straight the whole time as in a technique this with my mouth was like kind of born. I didn't really have any facial expressions. Now I'm like mostly smiling with this. I can say from my experience, from like just being observant that when I walk around, when I just interact with people, now I'm just naturally smiling. I'm like, I'm just naturally smiling. I'm naturally happy. I naturally enjoy stuff again. And the biggest reason why I'm like that is because self-improvement, self-improvement basically saved my life honestly. It put me on this path that it made me love life again. It made me see all the possibilities of who I could become and I try my hardest in becoming the best version of myself. Knowing that, knowing that I'm trying to become the best version of myself, I walk around knowing that I'm trying hard and that just makes me much happier. It makes me see the bright side of things because I don't have anxiety thinking about, oh, I didn't do this, I didn't do that. I didn't try hard enough in my goals. Now I'm like, I know I did. I know I tried. I know that I'm better than I was a year ago. I know that I've improved my physical life, my appearance, my mentality, how I talk, how my charisma, my work ethic. I've improved so many aspects of my life. I really, there's so many things to be happy about that I'm just naturally happy now. And it shows a couple days ago, I got a text from a friend, this, I got a text from a friend, this girl that I know. And she says, hey, I notice you've been smiling a lot more recently and I think you have a really great smile. I was like, what the hell, thank you. Like, I was really appreciative of that. And in that moment, I thought, holy shit. Like, yeah, I have been smiling a lot more than I asked her. What about how I was a couple of months ago? Like right now I'm in first-year university. What about how I was in high school? Like grade 12 of high school? How was it? It says, oh, you always had this straight face. You always look so serious and sometimes mad. And I was thinking, yeah, what the fuck? Yeah, she's right. Because back then, I was just beginning my journey, like, relatively, I was like, just beginning my journey of improving myself. And so I was still kind of unhappy with my physique. I was unhappy with my mentality, my work ethic, how much progress I've made, all of that. I was really unhappy. And so just naturally, I walked around with this. Like about, like, I don't know, it was like some macho fucking, I don't know, stoic thing. But now it's, I've entered this like era of my life where I can enjoy stuff. I can enjoy it because I know that I've come so far. Even in this past year, I've made so much more progress in this past year than I ever have in my life. And that just makes me so happy, that just makes me so appreciative. Like, I'm gonna be honest, I'm not where I wanna be in life. 100% not like money, career, physique, all of that. I'm not where I wanna be. But the fact that I've gotten so far from where I started makes me so much happier. Like, my physique right now. Right, hold on. This is my physique. It's all right. It's all right at best. I'd give myself like my physique, like, six, maybe seven. Judging by like, or like, I guess relative to the people around me, I'd give myself a good like seven. And that's not where I wanna be. Like, eventually, even now, I'm trying to be bigger, all of that. But the fact that I've come so far, the fact that I've made so much progress and making me so happy, like, I'm no longer that shy little kid. I'm no longer that skinny guy. Just like, I should build up my arms, holy shit. Like, I'm not that big, but it still makes me so happy. Like, that still makes me so happy that I made so much progress. I'm so happy that I can read books and enjoy them. I'm so happy that I can watch podcasts, like a movie that just makes me so happy how far I've come. And this is like the beauty of self improvement. Once you become this like newer, better version of yourself, you'll start to realize what the fuck. The person who I was before wasn't all that great. The person I am now is exponentially better. And that I guarantee you, once you start to improve your life, ask anybody in your life that goes to the gym, when they were skinny or fat, or skinny fat, were they happier than how they are now? 100% guarantee they're gonna say, yes, I'm much happier now. Why? Because they look fucking great. Like, obviously I'm not that big, right? I'm not that big, but it's still a decent amount of muscle. Like, I'm not gonna be narcissistic, even statistical about it, but it's still really fucking great. Like, I'm proud of this, holy fuck. Like, holy shit, this makes me so happy just thinking about all the problems that I made about how much I've improved my life. And it's also makes me happy that like, so many people nowadays are also improving their lives. I'm like joining this community of self-improvement of people always trying to become better. It just makes me so happy. I'm trying to inspire my friends to do the same. I have inspired my friends to do the same some of them. And it just makes me so happy that they're on this path. And that in and of itself is such a great feeling. If I like, with that feeling, there's no way I'd be frowning. Like, knowing that I've been helping people, knowing that I was helped, knowing how far I've come. I have like a permanent smile on my face. It's just natural. And also like quick bonus smile, it just makes you more attractive. Come on, it does. Who, if you were a girl, who would you rather approach? Me, like this. Or me, like this. Like obviously, I'm not smiling like a lunatic, just, no, maybe I have my phone out and only like that. Or like I'm talking to a friend with some shit. I'm smiling. I'm not just straight faced. Who would you rather approach? Yeah, so smiling is so much more attractive. It just makes you so, it's put you in this like great state. It's like being in meditation. Meditation like calms you down to put you in this sort of like headspace of focusing on your birth and just like just focusing in general. Happiness is like similar. It's like a similar headspace when you're not, I guess meditating when you're not in this like focused in deep state, you're happy. You're in this like joyous yellow stage of your life. And that's, I think that's just so beautiful. Holy fuck. I'm just really great that our generation has come so far because I truly believe that Gen Z Gen Alpha, I truly believe that like we're gonna do like great fucking things. And that's just making me so happy. Like holy shit. I just ordered this book on like the history of humans. I sat here a couple minutes ago just looking at it. I didn't even read. I was just like doing this. I was just flipping through the pages. I was just appreciating it. I was just thinking the amount of effort someone put into this book. How many people have read this book? All of these things makes me so happy now. It makes me so happy to know that there are so many things available to me, to know that there are so many like, to know that life is so ripe with information with opportunities. If I haven't ever, if I didn't go on self improvement a year or two years ago, I wouldn't be like this. I wouldn't be so appreciative. I wouldn't be so happy. I wouldn't be so attractive. Not that I'm wow, so attractive, but I wouldn't be as attractive as I am now. And for that, I thank God. Basically, I can just look around my room and be happy because of all the things that I have. I bought this glass bottle from a store the other day. I'm telling you, this might sound like super autistic or some shit, but as I was buying it, I sat in my car and I was just looking at it and I was like, this had milk in it and I was just like, one of my water bottles, I have a collection of glass bottles. I was just looking at it and I was appreciating it. Someone actually like, milked the cow, delivered it to the store and I'm here buying it. And I milked like tasted better than ever. It tasted better than I would have if I just sat there and I didn't know that. Get what I mean. My monitor, it makes me so happy that there are monitors that makes work insanely easy compared to how it was 70 years ago. Computer, same thing. Books, holy fucking shit. Where would we be without books, without all this information? We'd be nowhere. Our race would be like done for it. Oh yeah, we're gonna pass information through stories. Okay, yes, people have done that through the years, through history, but who are the successful ones in history? Who are the successful empires? The ones with knowledge, the ones with books, one with written history. My bed, holy, I switched out my bed last year. I used to have like a twin bed. I think it was, now I have a queen and it makes me so happy because my twin bed, like kind of give me a back problem. It's like every time I woke up, I had back problems, all of that, my spine hurt, my back hurt. But now it's just like I'm thinking holy fuck. If I never switched it out, I would still have those problems. I'm so appreciative of this fucking bed. It just makes me so happy that I've come so far. It makes me so happy that I have all these things in my life that I can be grateful for. Never stop being thankful. I'm telling you, never stop being thankful, never stop learning. You'll become such a happy person. You'll become such an attractive person. I want you to take what I said in this video very seriously, as if you do apply what I talked about in this video about happiness, about gratitude, all of that. If you do apply it in your life and start to become more, more grateful of the things in your life, you'll start to become happier. And if your angle's to just become more attractive, then I guarantee you, like, you'll become much more attractive if you'll start to just appreciate things because that appreciative nature inside of you will make you happier. And happiness is a very attractive emotion. Thank you for watching this video. As you did, bump up my viewer retention rate and I really do appreciate that because I am trying to grow this community of, like, my native individuals, where we do, like, help each other grow. And if you did learn something in this video, then congratulations good on you. That's massive.

Hi everyone, it's Keilani. You've never seen this side of me. Today, I'd like to talk about my long-standing struggle, which is chronic depression. I have been struggling with persistent depressive disorder for many many years. Persistent depressive disorder is also called dysthymia and it's a continuous long-term form of depression. You may lose interest in normal daily activities, feel hopeless, lack productivity, and have low self-esteem as well. These feelings last for years and may significantly interfere with your relationships, school work, and daily activities. Depression is not just feeling sad all the time; it's a serious medical illness. Sometimes I push myself to go out, but even when I'm having a good time with friends, there's always this low-hanging cloud over my head. That's how it feels like. There are so many things that I've done to get better, such as practicing CBT, healthy diet, mindfulness, and so on. When I lived in the States, I took an intensive yoga course. Ever since then, I've been practicing on my own. Those of you who have seen my lifestyle through my other videos may think that I have such a peaceful life, but that's not true. And I meditate whenever I can. Meditation helps me within the moment, especially when my mind travels back and forth between the past and the future. In order to stop feeling anxious, I practice positive affirmations. There are times when I can't function at all and have no energy to step outside the house. That's one of the reasons why I have many plants in my living room. I surround myself with greenery to give myself a sense of comfort. However, when major depression kicks in, I can't get out of bed. Can you imagine how it feels like? It feels like you're going through hell. When I'm in this condition, I can hardly take care of myself. Even though I love taking a long bath, when severe depression comes around, I can't even take a quick shower. I can say the same thing for cooking; when I'm in that condition, I can't cook. Before the pandemic, I visited Guam for vacation. If you see me like this, you probably cannot tell that I suffer from depression. Especially on social media, many of us only share the highlights of our lives, but you never really know how things are going in the lives of others. My parents and Jasmine have been my great support system, and I feel grateful for that. Especially my dad, he is always there for me to listen and empathize with my pain. Also, he always gives me credit for how far I've come. Spending time with Jasmine feels like I'm taking animal therapy. It's very comforting. Whenever I cry, she licks my tears and sits right next to me. I can see that she's aware of my condition. She literally heals my soul. I can't thank her enough. Good girl.",well-being
hey guys I have just been not doing good yesterday I had actually one of the worst teas in my entire life and I don't say that lightly um a lot went wrong and a lot of bad bad things happened that are

I've always struggled with happiness not necessarily becoming happy I I can be happy even if it's not always real but maintaining my happiness I am coming at you guys crusty and Dusty as hell I don't know what's going on you guys I don't know if Mercury is like in retrograde but this week I just have not been in it to win it like at all I've been so just in my head having so much anxiety lately like just crippling anxiety to the point I feel like I can't even do anything and it's been so hard but today I actually finally decided to get up and do a little something I just feel like I need to like cleanse my energy I need to revamp my aura so I decided let me like clean the house let me shower do a nice shower routine like do a good skincare routine like let me read my book like let me do things that like bring back my energy that's the plan today because I can't live like this no more I can't live like this no more [Applause] [Music] thank you okay you guys I don't know how good this camera angle is but it's just gonna have to do because your girl is trying okay I'm sure like a lot of you guys are wondering like why didn't I post last a week um by the time you guys are seeing this you probably saw my community post on YouTube and honestly like I don't know what like I I feel so bad sometimes because I feel like sometimes like you guys are like dang this chick is in her little moods you know but like I've this year has been so moody for me I don't know what's going on I just been going through these periods where I'm like close to happy and then I get into these really deep periods where I'm feeling pretty sad depressed low-key and I don't know what's happening it's like I can't really shake this funk I'm trying to give myself grace these days though yeah it's just been really tough this is the biosons um squalene vitamin C super bomb please get it I actually went to a tarot card reader today which that's how you know I'm really going through some because I don't normally go to a tarot card reader unless I've noticed I only go if I'm really going through something and I just like don't know what to do anymore then I'm like dude freaking Give Me A Sign because I'm I'm literally a hair close to giving up and she had like a lot of good things to say and she made me feel better in a lot of ways but one of the things that she said that I was like no girl is that I'm gonna move to Florida the if any of you guys know I actually went to college in Florida I went to UCF honestly Florida's not for me like I am not a Florida girl Florida is just like it makes me depressed it gives me so much so much anxiety like anytime I have to go there to visit family I have some family there some family in New York I'm never excited when I buy the plane ticket like I'm excited to see my family don't get me wrong like anytime I go to Florida I'm like excited to see the family you know after like two days I'm like itching to get the out so when she said that I was like no mama I'm sorry I know you've probably been doing this for a long time but I am I'm just not moving there I'm sorry I'm just not going there but she did give me like a lot of like reassurance that like I'm gonna be okay and stuff and that that feels good I'm like okay so my life isn't completely over because sometimes as a content creator I guess because it's not like a job that comes with a lot of security there are moments where I am just like this this is it like it's it's the end for me it's I've had my time I had fun like and it's just over it's just is what it is I need to find a better balance with social media I have not had a very good balance with social media and it has definitely affected my mental health like I find myself comparing myself to other people a lot and picking at certain parts of myself and it's just like unhealthy thoughts pretty much that are just like not good I want to get back into my reading era I remember I used to be such a bookworm I used to read all these books I used to read every single night I remember I used to journal every night meditate every night and then read myself to sleep and that was the best routine I think I ever had like the mental health was on 10 freaking thousand oh [Music] got me feeling better one minute I'm in like a depressive episode and then the next day I'm just like I feel good I feel so much better today like last night honestly I just took the night to like cook a nice dinner for myself did skincare like read my book and fell asleep this morning I like woke up I did a meditation I took my time realizing that I need to start setting like better intentions in my life like I said before I feel like I used to have like a morning routine I used to have a night routine like I used to have intentions in my day and I think I've it's funny how when we get to like a good place in our life mentally and physically we stopped doing those those routines and those intentions that we placed for ourselves to get us to that mental high and that good place in our lives like that's what I feel like happened at me like I got to a really good place like mentally physically and then I stopped doing those things that helped me get there in the first place and now I I struggle with like some days feeling low and some days feeling good and it's because I don't have anything to really fill my cup anymore so I just set some intentions like I said I want to read more I want to get back into meditation I want to do things in my life that fill my cup in order for me to keep going because honestly that's the only way your girl can keep going because when I tell you I am a hair away from popping off like Kanye eye my hair away [Music] just got back from food shopping and running a few errands and I love when Brands sent me things like it just feels like Christmas to me so this skincare brand called Dr Loretta just sent me some skincare I can't talk and I'm really excited because um one of them is an SPF actually but the SPF I have is like super low like it has to be up like 20 or something like that or 30. but this is SPF 40. so I'm really excited for this then we got this detoxifying face mask which I'm also excited about because my skin you guys like look what it like look at this hyper pigmentation like that's how you know like a has not been thriving this winter uh well treating a pet type Trent's a pet nuts try to peptide provides tightening uplifted skin contour and protects from Blue Light damage and then it also detoxifies and energizes skin from for revitalizing low sounds like it's going to bring my skin back to life and I'm super excited about it I can also use this overnight oh I love that I love a good overnight mask so I don't even have the urge to go out honestly I think I'm going to spend the rest of the day just like reading and meditating and relaxing I just want to stay home I have no urge to be outside no urge at all what's up so it is Saturday it's really late in the afternoon I just took the morning to work out by San Palo Santo get centered with myself and I was debating back and forth like do I want to leave the house or not here's the thing it's cold as balls outside like it's so freaking cold I don't know how the hell people are doing it but I'm about to be one of them I figured let me go out I've spent so much time in the house and if you know anything about me as I can spend so much time by myself so today I'm like you know what let me go find a cute little coffee shop in Bushwick and read my book I have been obsessed with this book Emily radakowski is my body so freaking good I know I'm late to the damn game I know people are watching this video like that was last year's news like what's next no no this book I had no idea how good of a writer she was she's an amazing writer and I've literally I haven't even had this book for a week and I'm I'm I don't have a book of art but I'm basically like halfway into it and I'm addicted like I can't I can't let it go so I'm gonna go to a coffee shop I'm gonna read this book and I'm gonna take you guys with me hopefully this tea doesn't cost me you know 20 Zola's nothing crazy [Music] the hell is that is the devil trying to get me guys I don't know I think this is like the neighbor putting something up but that rumbling has been going on for like an hour and I swear to God I thought somebody was trying to kill me like at least four times let's hope it doesn't happen anywho I'm gonna go to this coffee shop so I'll see y'all there [Music] foreign

working on your mental health can feel a lot like trying to Pilot a boat through the ocean on a foggy day there's not a lot of sense of direction or sense of progression you're working really hard but you can't necessarily look around and see if you're getting anywhere or if you are getting anywhere are you heading in the right direction or are you just wandering about aimlessly it's a very lonely frustrating and demoralizing journey but if you keep at it and if you work hard and you keep going in some certain direction sometimes eventually you will start to see your destination off through the fog on the horizon it may still be a long ways away and you may not be sure if you're going to reach it or not but it at least starts to feel possible if not probable that you're actually getting somewhere and that someday this might actually work out okay unfortunately a lot of the time when you start to get closer to that destination out of nowhere a storm rolls in a dark storm windy rainy dangerous and you have to go below deck you have to just hide and stay safe you can't stay on the deck anymore you have to bide your time and let this storm blow over and sometimes the storm lasts a long time weeks months sometimes years when you finally come up when it's finally safe to get back on your boat or from low deck I don't know exactly how seab boats work and look around can't see your destination anymore you've been blown who knows how far off course by this storm whether this storm is a depressive episode a period of heightened anxiety trauma triggers a new physical health condition grief some other life stressor you've been blown off course and you once again have no idea where you're going or whether you're even pointing in the right direction for the purposes of the video let's say it was a depressive episode a depressive episode if it's severe enough can stop you from using nearly all of your resources it can take almost everything away from you as it drains your willpower drains your energy messes up your social functioning messes up your physical functioning all this stuff you work so hard to build up and build habits with and build consistency with can be taken from you and you have to start over again from scratch it's so overwhelming and you don't even know where to begin if you think of it if we go back to our boat on the ocean metaphor you were in this boat you were going the right way and now this storm has come and knocked you very very far off course right if you keep moving straight in other words if you keep going the direction you're going in you're going to miss your destination now and you're going to end up very very lost when an depressive episode hits it affects how we spend our time our sleep hygiene gets messed up we often are not physically active we stop spending time with people we stop taking care of our homes our bodies we don't go to work we don't go to school we stop doing all the things that keep us on course because we no longer feel able to what I see happen to people time and time again though is that when the episode itself passes and if you have major depressive disorder bipolar disorder or any cyclical mood disorder your depression then does come and go in episod that doesn't mean you feel completely fine when you're not in in a depressive episode but it means there's going to be ups and downs es and flows but when you're feeling better whatever that means for you you don't automatically get back on track you don't automatically revert to the lifestyle and the habits that you had before you often continue to live like a depressed person even though you are no longer in a depressive episode because the those are the habits and routines and momentum that were built up for you it's not your fault this just happens but that were built up for you during that depressive episode and so you continue to live like a depressed person even when you are not necessarily clinically depressed during this period of time the only way to get out of that and get back on track is to look at what changed during the episode what did this depressive episode take from you what did you stop doing and that may be a very very long list I know writing it all out can be very frustrating very ironically depressing right but I do think you should probably do it this is what I encourage people to do we covered this last week in intensive outpatient programming because this is where a lot of people are right now and here's what I had them do we all worked on making lists of everything that our most recent depressive episode took from us every single way in which we were knocked off course and these were lists of maybe you know 15 20 25 items many many things on this list sleep nutrition physical activity social functioning vacuuming dishes work school you know the list goes on playing guitar writing reading next I had them divide the items on their list into inputs and outputs inputs are the behaviors that give you more than they take from you and terms of things like time energy and attention in other words they more than pay you back for what you have to put into them outputs of course are the opposite your outputs are things that take more time energy and attention from you than they put back into your system but the outputs are usually things that are still really important for our lifestyle sustainability in general let me explain that a little more because this this is the centerpiece of this whole idea and I want to make absolutely sure that you guys get it it's very similar to a financial budget so most systems have inputs and outputs in a financial budget your inputs of course are your income so it's your paycheck and whatever other money you have coming in and your outputs are your expenses your bills and whatever else in any system that has inputs and outputs the ideal is to make sure that inputs exceed outputs or else the system is unsustainable and will eventually collapse your inputs in your mental health system some of them are going to be Universal and some of them are going to be specific to you so Universal inputs these are really pretty much going to be true for all people what includes things like sleep hygiene nutrition if you take psychiatric medication compliance with psychiatric medication um minimal or no substance use these are all not even really basic mental health tools but really basic brain health tools for all people and they certainly don't have to be perfect but if those things are not in at least a decent place it's very very hard for your brain to work correctly and it's very hard not to function at a deficit there are also things that are almost universally going to be outputs there's always an asterisk here because some everyone's brain is different and we perceive and react to things differently but for most people things like work and school are probably going to be outputs they're things that are important things we do need to do but they're not things we can just do indefinitely they're things that take a lot out of us and we have to recharge or replenish from them I think also for most people a lot of your chores your activities of daily living probably fall under the output category as well as probably hygiene for most people but that one I know can be an exception there are also a lot of variables on this list that are really going to be dramatically different from one person to the next in terms of which category they fall into so you have to really know yourself to do this activity correctly I'll give you a couple examples of that that so for me physical activity like exercise is 100% an input in fact it is one of the most important inputs that I have yes it does take a lot of energy and time to do but it pays me back throughout the day and ultimately it gives me more than it takes for me personally I recognize that that is not true for everybody and that many people find it to be really just a burden um and it does not function that way something I'm on the opposite side of is socializing I am a pretty introverted person and so being socially active takes more than it gives from me I cannot socialize indefinitely it puts a major drain on my system to do so even if I like and love the people I'm interacting with and I do have to have a recovery period from that for a really extroverted person social engagement is probably an input it is something that is really really giving to their system and helps them keep going it might be one of the most important resources for them to recover from a depressive episode for me it is not once you have determined what falls on the input list and what falls on the output list what I encourage people to do next is focus as much as possible exclusively on the input list we want to get as much coming back into your system as possible before we try to start taxing your system by putting expectations on you I know sometimes there are real world limitations to this in terms of things like your job or you know some of you are parents it can't always be perfectly all inputs first then work on the outputs but to the best of your ability I encourage people to focus almost exclusively on rebuilding those inputs work on getting back on track with the things that are going to recharge and replenish your system and make more resources available for you to do the things that fall in the output column far too often the things that are on the output list are often the things that other people see in our lives other people don't necessarily see how you're sleeping or how you're eating or whether you're taking your meds or not they do see whether you're going to work or not they do see whether you're going to school or not they do see whether you're showering or not or you know you get what I'm say saying um and so those are often the areas that other people really emphasize for us to get back on track with they tell us you you know you last time you were doing better you were doing all of these things so you should try to get back to doing all of these things to stay better what they don't realize and and I think this is usually a well-meaning But ultimately unhelpful perspective to take is you were doing those things because your system was working properly those things were not the cause of your improved mood they were the effect of your improved mood the cause of your improved mood was the inputs the behind the-scenes stuff that most people cannot observe in your life and what I see happen far too often is as soon as people have started to recover from a depressive episode or any type of setback they try to jump right back into their lifestyle at full speed they don't have all their inputs set back up yet and they start to reintroduce all of these RS on their system and they ultimately end up in an unsustainable pattern which hastens the onset of the next episode and keeps you stuck in this vicious cycle of episode after episode after episode because you never have a chance to fully rebuild from the last one I know I'm mixing metaphors and it's dangerous but it's like you your home gets destroyed by an earthquake or something like that right and the foundation is damaged and you work on the foundation a little bit but the foundation is still very cracked and very unsettled and you start building all the upper level stuff you start rebuilding the kitchen rebuilding the bathrooms etc etc but the foundation's not rebuilt yet and So eventually along comes another earthquake and since the foundation is still unstable the whole thing falls apart again and we just get caught rebuilding these upper levels over and over and over again either not realizing or just not having the luxury of working on the found you have to rebuild the foundation if you want the things you're going to stack on top of the foundation to be resilient to the es and flows in your mental health status and the general ups and downs and stressors in life that you will face so that was that was our focus last week I hope this little peek into the psychoeducation portion of my intensive outpatient program maybe has some applicability or at least some interest to you all as always please feel free to ask any comments that any questions that you might have in the comments I'll do my best to answer them and if the same question pops up for a lot of people I will make a follow-up video on that topic to explain it more thoroughly I always want to say too like I recognize that this is easier said than done I break this down into a very simple concept I know that actually executing the plan that I have laid out here is not as simple but knowing is half the battle and hopefully by having this information you've at least got that half covered good luck and take care I'll see you next time,well-being

"So I just wanted to take a moment to reflect on how happy and nice my life is. So usually I feel like all of us in general, we can get down sometimes and not take enough time to reflect on our actual lives. So that's what I wanna do right now. I wanna reflect on my life and how grateful I should actually be. So overall, my life is amazing. I mean, if we're looking at the world in general, there's so many bad things going on. There's so much war, so much suffering, and I'm inflicted to none of these. I am able to wake up every single day and make breakfast, have food. I never have to worry about whether there's food on my table, which is already something we should be so grateful about. And I am like, there's so many children, not even just children, so many people in the world right now who are struggling to get food, and I'm not one of those people. Secondly, my friends and family. I am so grateful to have so many loving people around me. Also so grateful to still have so many people around me. I know a lot of people have had to deal with a lot of grief of family members dying. I'm so grateful with the fact that not only are all of my family members still alive, I mean, except my great grandparents, but my grandparents are still alive. My parents are still alive. Every every aunt and uncle is still alive. So I'm very grateful about that as well. And secondly, not only are they alive, but they support me in everything I do. Because at the end of the day, family is not blood. Family is someone who you choose. And I, even though my family is my blood, I would choose them over and over again because of how loving and amazing they just are. They constantly provide for me. They have everything I need. I can get to call them every time and just get their love and support. And I'm so happy about that, and I don't really realize that as much. I always forget that and view the negative sides of my life, which none of that matters. All of the negative things are usually things that can be solved within matter of minutes, hours, days, or weeks. And there's nothing actually threatening, to my life. Next is where I'm living. So Amsterdam is such a great environment. There's, I mean, everything has everything to offer. There's nothing I could want more. No city maybe except the weather, but, that's something again, a little thing, which actually does not mean much in terms of life and happiness. And I'm just so happy. And I realize this over and over again when I do actually take a moment to reflect because taking these times out of your day is so important to just sit down and think, well, actually, it doesn't matter that this and this person did this and this because who actually cares? What matters is that I have all the necessities. I have food, I have water, I have shelter. I have love from my parents and friends. So what else could I truly need? So I really think that general reflection is so important because it's just doing this, just taking, like, 2 seconds from my time and think about this. Getting up from bed, stopping the horrible mood, stopping this constant cycle of being on my phone and just scrolling and scrolling, which is doing nothing. It gives me a little bit of peace and knowledge that actually everything is okay. And especially saying out loud, recording it, it makes it more real rather than just thinking it because some thoughts can get so muddled up and you can constantly find yourself on a new, train of thought. And it's hard to sometimes stay on the same train of thought. But when you're talking out loud, it's a lot easier to continue the sentence to say, I love my life. I love my friends. I love my family. I love where I live. I love Amsterdam. I mean, what is there to not like in my life? There's I bet so many people out there who wish they could have a life like me. So, yeah, I think it's so important to do this. And, yeah, overall, I am very happy. I'm very grateful. I should be more grateful than I am. I should be doing more gratefulness activities. Sadly, I am not, but that is something hopefully that could change someday soon. So, yeah, overall, I think I'm doing okay. My studies are going well. My university course is great. I think, yeah, my life is moving the direction it should. Of course, there's always hills and bumps that might, like, seem harmful, but actually they're just leading us in the right way because going somewhere where you shouldn't, even if that at the time seems right, is also not good. So, yeah, I just wanna end with another. I'm so grateful for everything in my life.",well-being
"So my life, how is it going? Well, at the moment, I'm actually extremely happy. There's so much to be grateful for. When I think about the past couple of weeks, I recall memories of always hanging out with my friends, doing exciting stuff on the weekend, and feeling so much happiness. It was just Halloween. Halloween was great. We went to multiple parties. Wong was at an amazing penthouse. It was so big and I went there and I've I've never seen something as big as that. I felt I felt like a giant. I felt I felt so happy being in such a place like Amsterdam where I may be able to experience all of these crazy things that I've never seen before. Then we had the proper Halloween party on Halloween where we went to a club. I may have went to Little Bit too overboard but it was still so much fun. I had I felt so much love from all of my friends and I was so happy to be there. Now this weekend, I have so many exciting plans this weekend. There's 2 clubs that I'm going to and I I can't wait to spend more time with my friends and hang out and do fun stuff. Amsterdam overall has been such a great experience. I can't even imagine doing something else than being here right now. I'm I'm so happy. If only there was more sunlight. The weather is sadly getting a bit gray, which is my mood at times but I'm still trying my best to keep up my spirits. To do this, I I try to eat healthy, do exercise, and maintain a healthy body. This truly lifts up my spirit because I know that when I'm not participating in these acts I get a little bit sad. Hence, I'm always happy. Of course there are times when I wish that something was better in my life but overall there's it couldn't be better. I'm so grateful. I'm a little bit sad that I'm not with my family all the time but then I have even more excitement in seeing them soon. In just a month, a little bit over a month, I'm going to be visiting my parents for Christmas, spending our lovely Christmas holiday together, eating amazing food, and just feeling happy and loved. Last Christmas, for example, we had such a great dinner. We had a, a goose with some red cabbage, some nice gravy, some potato. I'm not exactly sure how they're called in English, actually, but overall, such good food. I was with my whole family. Nothing makes me feel better than being with my family. And, of course, with my pets, I can't wait to see my 2 cats. My 2 cats bring me so much joy and happiness. It's it's the best feeling in the entire world. Overall, I'm so grateful for having my pets and I wish they were with me at the moment. However, that's one thing I can't wait for. I, in a couple of years, when I will be living by myself in a nice place, I can get some animals like a dog or a cat which again will bring me so much joy as they are doing at the moment. School is going great as well. We have such nice teammates. We have everyone's everyone's collaborating. Everyone's working together. We all share the same mindset. It's it's such it brings me so much peace to know that I can trust my teammates with everything and to know that they're always working on the things I want them to. So life overall is great. I'm just so happy with myself as well doing everything I am, keeping on top of work which is always good, making sure all my tasks are turned in on time. This also creates less stress myself which is important because stress makes me sad. But because I have no stress, I am allowed to feel happiness. This also lets me not have idle time because if I stress that I procrastinate, which makes a lot of idle time where I wish I was doing work, but I'm not because I'm not doing this and doing my work on time and I have so much time to spend relaxing as well, which allows for for balanced life. Because then when I'm going out and I'm doing my favorite activities, I know that I don't have to worry about not getting enough sleep because I've already done my work. So then I can sleep in and relax and get up and do my next activity because, overall, my life is so great, and I'm so so happy. Yeah.",well-being
"Hi. So I just wanna reflect on my life a little bit, talk about my well-being, talk about how I'm doing. So of course there's goods and bads. I mean, I've been feeling a little bit lost in life. There's been some bumps at the moment. I do think a lot of that has to do with my hormones, which is just a scientifical fact. I mean, I'm not trying to say that. I'm just like this trying to blame it on anything because but while I was having my period I was feeling very down, very sad. I was crying for days at end which is not fun at all. Thankfully my period is over now so I'm not just crying, which is always good. Yeah. But I've been feeling quite stressed lately actually. I mean just the thought of masters blooming, thought of life continuing, thought of again, having to move on, move to a different country, which is just something I've been doing my entire life. I mean I feel like I've low key a bit of fear of abandonment issues as, especially living abroad my entire life. Most people don't stay in one country. Well my parents and me we did stay in a country for a very long time which meant however that I was the one who got left behind a lot of the time and my friends kept moving on which of course is not great either moving from country to country. And I guess I had more stability in that sense but at the same time I do did always then suffer with having to live lose friends over and over again having to find friends because of that. I feel like I find it quite easy to find friends, however, I find it quite difficult to make extremely strong bonds which I do realize all the time. There's only 2 people in my life who were in my life for 8 years. So there were also some people who stayed in the country for a very long time who we think I have extreme bonds with. Other than that, I do struggle a little bit. However, my life is not all down, of course. I am very happy with everything in my life. I have a great family. I have great friends, and I should be extremely happy. To make myself more happy, I should be increasing stuff like diet and exercise. But at the moment, I'm just always paralyzed with the stress of uni even though there's very little to do but just that little bit sometimes paralyzes me and then I can't do anything and I chill in bed which of course is never good. So I think that's something I definitely need to work on because stress is, I don't know, stress gets me a lot, but I do it to myself because I I tell myself, oh, I work better under pressure. I work better under stress. But is that really true? I'm not sure, to be honest, because it just makes me sad because then I'm so stressed that I can't hang out with my friends. And then I'm sad and I'm lonely because I'll just be in my home for days at the time trying to do my work and failing and then crying because I'm lonely and I'm sad and I'm not doing anything. My life feels stuck. And to do that, I should just do my work, but I have this paralyzing fear of procrastination, which is so horrible. But here I am doing my work for once, which is good.
So that makes me happy. The thing is, at the end of the day, like, it's so weird. I feel like humans, like, don't do what they should because if I just did my work not only would I not have the stress but I'd feel so great about myself which would make me happier and my well-being better. But because I'm not doing it I get more stressed and I get more sad. So just doing the work but for some reason sometimes I just really cannot and it's such a struggle and it's really painful actually. But, you know, doing one step at a time. The problem is just that we have we're in such a new generation of this this TikTok brain dead population that has no attention span and constantly needs to be doing something, which is really horrible, and it affects me too. I tried I tried deleting TikTok, but it's just my phone in general and just the Internet that there's so much to do. And the best thing would be to just put away our phone, put away the Internet, but it's not as easy as that because that's a way of communicating. That's a way of doing any work, any presence with friends and family. I mean, my family is abroad in so many different countries that I just could not even, like, couldn't communicate with them if I didn't have the Internet. So, of course, there's so many positives, but but the positives comes negative negatives. And I feel like people always try to, I don't know, wash over them and and say, oh, just don't talk about the negative stuff. Talk about the positive stuff. Your life is great. Yes. But we need to address the but to make it even better because if we ignore it, it doesn't get better. So, yeah, even though my life is great, I do feel very sad and lonely and stressed a lot of the time. And this is just me being honest about my well-being. So, yeah, thank you.",well-being
" Hi so today I'm just gonna talk about my life and why I am so grateful for everything that I have because I realize that usually when I make those kind of videos, I just talk about how bad I feel and know about how you know how great my life actually is and how grateful I am for what I have.

"Yeah. When I was thinking about my well-being back in the old days, I actually think it's really positive. I had such a great, amazing and wonderful time. Um, when I was a child, I was jumping around on the playground with my friends, with my best friends. They were so friendly. They were so, I don't know, wonderful. And, uh, just, I don't know, exciting. It was just an exciting time to be alive. An exciting time to to run around, to explore new, wonderful, um, neighbourhoods in my town. We went to the woods, we, um, played football. Um, we won. We won a lot of games.

"Hey guys, today we re gonna talk about the influence of journaling And Here is my Journal Its basically about something something bad moods, something something difficulties that has come in to my study, like my procrastination, uh, you know what is happening There are almost no differences with other journals, no beautiful illustrations or images, just quite a simple one. But, journaling has become an essential part of my daily life that keeps me balanced, my mind clear, and my spirit calm. It's amazing how this simple habit can make such a huge improvement, not only in the way I spend my day, but also in the way I feel mentally and emotionally First of all, journaling gives me a way to get myself organized. Sitting down to journal at the end of the day allows me to release my mind. Writing down thoughts, feelings, or any unresolved issues helps me make sense of them. It's like I'm clearing out mental clutter and allowing my brain to relax. Often, just by seeing my thoughts on paper, I can understand them better and even see solutions to problems I hadn't noticed before This habit has also been very beneficial to my mental health. When I feel stressed or anxious, writing helps me calm down, especially on chaotic or overwhelming days in Netherlands. It's a quiet moment where I can let go of everything bothering me and focus on how I'm feeling. This process of self-reflection is almost therapeutic. By gaining a deeper understanding of my thoughts and emotions, I feel more resilient and empowered to face whatever comes my way One of the surprising effects of journaling is that it encourages gratitude. Over time, I found myself naturally noticing the positives of each day, even if they were just little things like a beautiful sunset or a nice meeting with the girls. It helps me turn my attention to gratitude, which improves my overall mood and perspective. This daily gratitude is a powerful antidote to negative thoughts or emotions, creating a more balanced and positive outlook on life Finally, journaling strengthens my connection to myself. In our fast-paced world, it's easy to lose sight of our goals and values. But by journaling, I have a space to reconnect with the things that are important to me. I can track my personal growth, explore my thoughts on different experiences, and even make plans for the future. It's a constant reminder of who I am and who I want to be, giving me a clearer sense of direction In short, journaling keeps my daily life both organized and calm. It's a simple yet effective way to reflect, reset, and grow. With each journal entry, I feel more fulfilled, more grateful, and more resilient.",well-being
"So today I am gonna talk something about meditation Meditation has helped me stay in the present moment and has greatly improved my emotional well-being. In a world full of distractions, it is easy to get caught up in thinking about the past or the future, constantly reacting to things without a moment's pause. However, meditation has taught me the value of simply “being”. Through this practice, I have learned to focus on each present moment, observing my breath, my body and my surroundings without judgment. This focus allows me to move through each day with greater peace and concentration, letting go of unnecessary worries and experiencing life with a more open mind I also found a book titled A Practical Manual on Meditation, written by Massimo Scaligero, who is a master of Western esotericism and meditation tradition. I highly recommend this book! After reading this book, I realized that meditation is beneficial in developing a stable mental state and ultimately mediating negative emotions. I felt it was exactly what I needed. It is a crime that few people in need of improving well-being know this book Meditation has also become an important tool for self-reflection. The techniques I have learned, especially from the Buddhist tradition, encourage me to look inward and examine my thoughts and feelings with curiosity and compassion. Buddhist meditation usually involves observing a person's thoughts, noticing patterns, and understanding the root cause of the thoughts or feelings rather than trying to change them. This approach has given me a clearer understanding of who I am, my motivations, and how I react to different situations. Over time, I noticed a change in my relationship with myself: I was kinder, less critical, and more forgiving. This practice of self-compassion has helped me better understand my inner world and develop a healthier relationship with myself One of the most significant benefits has been the impact on my emotional well-being. Meditation provides a refuge, a space where I can release stress and regain inner peace. Buddhism focuses on positive thinking and letting go of attachment to fleeting thoughts or material issues. This philosophy helped me cultivate a state of acceptance and taught me to face challenges without being overwhelmed. Now, when I experience stress or anxiety, I can rely on this practice to calm my mind and allow me to face the ups and downs of life with greater balance and resilience In addition, meditation connects me to a deeper sense of spiritual well-being. The teachings that inspire me-especially Buddhist teachings-suggest that true peace lies in moving beyond surface thinking, beyond the chatter and agitation we often feel. Through meditation, I experience brief but powerful moments of calm and insight, moments that remind me that there is more to life than the daily grind. This perspective is priceless; it keeps me grounded and keeps me focused on what really matters Meditation has brought about countless positive changes in my life. It has taught me the art of being, encouraged self-compassion, and provided me with powerful tools to achieve spiritual peace. Inspired by ancient practices, meditation is more than just a routine for me; it is a way of understanding myself and the world around me, providing me with a path to a deeper level of consciousness, serenity and a fulfilling life So if I have a problem that I can't solve on my own, the first thing I do is use meditation to calm myself down",well-being
"Today we're talking about a brilliant trick for promoting emotional well-being: spending less time reading the news In recent months, I've made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of time I spend reading the news, a change that has brought noticeable benefits to my daily life, my ability to self-reflect, and my overall mental health. We live in an age where news and social media surround us on a daily basis, and much of it is designed to engage us. Limiting my exposure to this information cycle has proven to be extremely valuable, allowing me to regain control of my time, maintain a clearer mind, and experience a greater sense of calm Imagine you open your browser, X, Instagram, Tiktok ...... every day and everyone is unapologetically telling you that things are bad. Can you be in a good state of mind every day then? Come closer, I'm telling you the real deal right now: this is how modern media works. These guys are cringing. Every day, over and over again, feeding you the same pile of garbage so they can take the opportunity to take control of your life, even the time and money you spend After reading many, many of these things, I eventually got bored and quit. Because news stories on social media are exaggerated and often emotionally draining. Modern media tends to sensationalize, constructing stories to grab attention in a way that maximizes shock or fear. Something as small as a fire in your city or as big as a potential economic crisis is usually given only an uncertain time period as well.blablabla...... These methods may suit the media's purpose, but they leave me feeling anxious and heavy. By getting out of this cycle, I freed up time that I can now spend on truly meaningful activities. I read more books, explore hobbies, and connect with others in a more genuine way. My day is no longer determined by the latest breaking news, but by my more intentional organization of my time Reducing my news reading has also increased my ability to be self-reflective. Without the distraction of constant updates and information overload, I was able to reconnect with my thoughts and feelings. In a way, reducing my news and social media reading has cleared my mindspace and made it easier for me to reflect on myself. I found myself thinking more critically and focusing on my goals, values, and personal growth, rather than getting caught up in endless arguments or worries about events beyond my control. This quiet time of reflection clears my head and helps me understand myself better and make choices that are in line with what really matters to me Additionally, reducing the amount of time I spend on social media has stopped me from regretting it. I used to spend hours scrolling through tons of information, and I would often feel regret or frustration afterward, wondering where the time went. Why was I sitting on the couch reading this? Why didn't I go do my homework or read some books, go to the gym, or even go play cards with my friends during this time? By limiting this habit, I've managed to redirect my time to activities that add real value to my life. This decision makes me feel empowered because I know that my time is being spent on something meaningful rather than passively consuming information All in all, staying away from constantly updated news and social media has made a huge shift for me. It has improved my day-to-day life, allowed for deeper self-reflection, and enhanced my mental health. Instead of reacting to news headlines, I now choose to focus on enriching my life and cultivating a sense of inner peace and purpose. For those who are overwhelmed by today's media environment, I highly recommend trying this approach - it may give you the clarity, peace and freedom you didn't realize you were losing",well-being
"Today, I would like to talk to you about the University of Amsterdam's undergraduate program in Computational Social Sciences, and as a second-year student in this program, I would like to talk about how my experience of attending it was. What are its pros and cons First, let's talk about the interdisciplinary nature of the program. Computational Social Science at the University of Amsterdam blends social science, computer science, data analytics, and math. You're not just studying sociology or psychology; instead, you'll learn how to use data-driven methods to explore complex social issues. Imagine analyzing real-world problems like the impact of social media on mental health or climate change while learning the computational tools to solve them in innovative ways. That's pretty cool, isn't it Another advantage is the break from traditional classroom learning. Many of the courses are project-based and involve collaborative work, and you'll be working on real-world challenges with your classmates rather than sitting in a classroom listening to lectures day in and day out. This approach not only makes learning more dynamic and engaging, it also gives you hands-on experience in applying your skills to real-world problems. Through these programs, you will develop teamwork, problem-solving and communication skills. In these programs, you also have the opportunity to work directly with professionals and organizations, which is invaluable for networking and understanding how to apply what you learn in the real world However, these experiences depend on how outspoken you are. If you unfortunately have a fear of frequent group meetings and speaking in front of crowds, then my advice would be to switch programs. In addition, you may also encounter some ...... less than “ideal” teammates and maddening demands from your project partners, so be prepared to accommodate and assist them in their endeavors Finally, one thing that many students appreciate is that the program relies very little on exams. You know, we college students have had enough of test after test. Compared to other undergraduate programs at UvA, we don't have exam weeks or make-up sessions, so we theoretically have the longest vacations, don't we The corresponding consequence, of course, is that, at least for me, the lack of exams to push me on, and relying only on essays and projects for assessment may be detrimental to my mastery of real knowledge. The advice I would give as a second-year student is to make sure you are prepared to study on your own. For example, in the second year, what you are taught in lectures and workshops is not enough for you to master the real machine learning, and you have to make extra time for self-study. At least 40 hours out of the week should be devoted to studying, and the amount of time spent on self-study is likely to be more than the total amount of time you spend listening to lectures Of course, UvA has long taken all this into account during the online matcing activities, which is why I strongly recommend everyone interested in the program to take part in the matching - it's the best opportunity to get a preview of the program once you get your con offer. If you have good scores and hold an interest in the program, then come",well-being
"Hello everyone Today, I’d like to introduce you to a writer I’ve recently been exploring, Gustav Meyrink. He’s a fascinating author whose novels are as mysterious and haunting as the man himself.Known best for his novel The Golem, Meyrink was an Austrian writer who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his works blend mysticism, surrealism, and philosophical ideas in ways that make them timeless and intriguing Meyrink’slife itself is something of a legend. Born in 1868, he was involved in the esoteric and occult movements of his time, experimenting with alchemy, mysticism, and even  freemasonary. These experiences deeply influenced his writing. He often infused his work with mystical and philosophical themes, questioning reality and exploring altered states of consciousness. You get the sense that he wasn’t just writing to entertain; he was trying to understand the nature of existence and the spiritual realms that lie beyond our everyday world The novel The Golem, one of his most famous works, is a great example of this blend of reality and mysticism. It’s set in the Jewish quarter of Prague, and it draws on the legend of the Golem—a creature made of clay. One thing that stands out in Meyrink’s writing is his exploration of duality. He often presents life as a balance between light and darkness, body and soul, or reason and the unknown. He had a deep interest in the occult, but he also wrote with a philosophical, almost existential tone. In The Golem, and in other novels like The Green Face and The White Dominican, Meyrink explores these themes of duality and transformation. His characters often go through personal awakenings, journeys that force them to question the fabric of reality and their own identities What I find particularly fascinating about Meyrink's work is how he writes about the quest for self-discovery and enlightenment. His characters are often searching for something beyond the material world - an inner truth, a spiritual awakening. Meyrink believes in the concept of the “higher self,” which he interprets through his knowledge of Eastern philosophy, Gnosticism, and Kabbalah. He seems to believe that everyone has hidden spiritual potential, but that this potential can only be unlocked through intense and often painful self-examination and transcendence of the self In reading Meyrink's novels, you almost feel like you are entering a world of ancient wisdom. His writing style is immersive and symbolic, which makes his books feel more like a journey than a simple story. The cityscape, the weather and even the architecture are full of meaning, as if every aspect of the environment reflects the inner states of the characters. The book isn't always easy to read - Meyrink's writing can be dense, and he doesn't hand you the answers. But that's one of the reasons his novels are so engaging. He encourages you to look between the lines and think deeply about what he has to say about life and reality.Thanks for listening, and I hope I’ve inspired you to check out Meyrink’s work",well-being

"hello everyone today I've got another cool video for you I'm going to show you how to create and run an ethereum sniping boot using AI power chat GPT and guess what it's already making me passive income daily and I guarantee you you will make a profit if you do everything according to the instructions the sniping bot keeps an eye on the blockchain hunting for new tokens and massive price changes when it spots an opportunity it acts like a ninja quickly buying or selling tokens before most Traders even realize what happening this gives us an unmatching advantage to cast in on those price differences the bot Secret Sauce is its ability to find tokens just as they listed or when there's a sudden price movement it uses smart algorithm to identify this movement and boom it makes the trades for you so you can just sit back and watch the profits roll in if you're thinking man this sounds way too complicated don't sweat it it's actually pretty easy and you don't even need to know any of that coding mumbo jumbo just stick around and let's get this thing rolling all right let's get started hey Chad GPT write me the code for a smart contract on ethereum to automatically hunt for sniffing opportunities to earn ethereum [Music] [Music] there you go Chad GPT is running a code and I bet it's better than any human could possibly think of then head over to eth remix dobot remix is a web three application that allows us to develop compile deploy and launch Smart contracts coded in the solidity language I'll put a link to remix in the description below make sure you have the metamask browser extension installed and you're connected to the ethereum main net if it's your first time on remix it may ask you to agree to their terms I've already done it head over to the sidebar on the left and create a new contract under the contract folder we're going to name it bot. Sol next copy this code from chat GPT and paste it into the bot.
O file you've just created this is our snipping trading bot I will also place this code under the description so that you can copy it if you don't have access to chat GPT a couple of things to look at after pasting the code in lines 15 and 16 you can follow these address using ether scan these are the addresses of wrapped ether tokens which we'll be competing against you don't actually need to have any wrapped ether yep perfect it's the official wrapped ether address always a good idea to check that back to remix now that our bot file is ready let's compile it click here as you can see here it's built with the 0.6.5 version of solidity under compiler select the 0.6.0 version so that it matches our contract also make sure that the language is set to solidity and evm version is set to default now click on the compile bot. Soul button and wait for the bot to compile now we're going to deploy this to our wallet head over to the deploy and run transactions tab in remix here you'll want to select the injected web 3 as the environment we need to confirm the contract on the blockchain by paying gas fees gas fees are the commission on the ethereum network for smart contract deployment now the deployment under utility is ready to go click deploy I always set the gas fee to high there's usually not much of a difference and it puts the transaction through much faster now we wait for the transaction to confirm sweet we can see here that it is confirmed meaning our smart contract is deployed now you can see the various functions for our smart contract start enables the bot to start monitor ENT in the markets and withdraw stops the bot and transfers funds back into your wallet with the smart contract deployed fund it with some ethereum which will be used for trading make sure you get the right address there you can fund the contract with whatever amount of ethereum you want but keep in mind that the more you put in the larger the trades you'll be able to make and potentially more profit you can accumulate over time [Music] sweet there we go the transaction confirms that the funds were sent to the contract we can make sure by checking our contract address on The Ether scan once again ensuring our ethereum is in the contract nice it's got one ethereum which is the amount we funded the contract with last step is to click Start this will enable the bot to start sniffing the mempool to find different liquidity pairs in order for you to sandwich transactions let's set the gas speed to high save and click [Music] confirm all right guys it's been a little over 6 hours now and it's time to check the profits the bot made so as you can see I have about 1.3 ethereum which is 31% of the profit already I'm going to let my bot run for about another 6 hours and withdraw the profits after [Music] all right let's see how much more we made nice it's a little over 1.5 ethereum so it basically took me a half a day to gain over half of my deposit back that's pretty impressive the bot will continue to run until you click the withdraw button when you click withdraw the bot will stop trading and return to the total ethereum you've entered initially including the profit back to your wallet so let's click it this will charge us a little bit of gas I'll set it to high again and then click confirm there we go then transaction confirmed let's go to our metamask and see what we have now you can see the balance from the bot is already now in my wallet this is only after running the bot for more than half a day unreal I've even had weeks where I've made 3 to six ethereum sometimes even more the profits will fluctuate week to week guys share your profits in the comments below drop a like and don't forget to subscribe for more profitable ways to make passive income using web 3 tools",non-well-being
"so you want to become smart in most of the world you're told that it takes 12 years of school plus 4 years of college plus 6 years of graduate school to become smart but what you actually become is homeless that's not even a joke but on the bright side when you make a Reddit post about how you can't get a job you can do it in perfect English if you haven't guessed by the title becoming smart is actually very easy even if you think your genetics make you dumb if you compare yourself to every other animal you're actually pretty over powered when people like you and me say we want to get smarter it means a bunch of things we want to learn useful skills ideally skills that make money we want to be good at solving problems hopefully for money we want to get better geds and learn difficult subjects to make more money and also to flex on people and lastly we want to sound smart in conversation just enough so people respect you but not too much to the point where people think you're a nerd the problem is most advice on the Internet is so vague and philosophical that even if it works the only people who could actually follow it are Oprah and Socrates and if you instead look for specific advice that you can actually try right now this is what you get eat blueberries cuz they brain food drink black coffee exercise sleep more take IQ tests listen to classical music these things sound good but at some point you have to you know actually learn stuff besides even in the past there have been some Geniuses who have spent the whole day sitting at a desk desk getting 2 to 4 hours of sleep a day so what can you actually do to get smarter that's not just the same six brain hacks from a Facebook post copied and pasted from a Wiki how article inspired by a quote spray painted on a New York Subway wall the main thing you need to do is read what kind of reading it depends fiction is good for learning to read faster and it gives you a better vocabulary also if you read a lot of dialogue it makes you feel like you have friends but most people go straight for non-fiction which indeed is the key to being able to casually drop interesting knowledge in conversations for example just by reading this book you can come off to anyone in conversation as someone who knows history the key is to not be obnoxious about it crazy how we evolved from chimpanzees right well actually evolution is nonlinear and several human like species inhabited Earth simultaneously none of which could even be remotely considered as chimpanzees while this is considered polite by the standards of a YouTube comment section in real life saying well actually before proving someone wrong will make you instantly unlikable change the well to
from chimpanzees right it is crazy right you know I was reading the other day and apparently humans and chimpanzees I always thought we evolved from them but I guess we just evolved side by side you can be smart while also being humble and also sounding like you touch grass the key is to teach people what you know without making them sound dumb this way people will actually learn from you which will make them see you as smart and respectable now how do you find these books it's actually really easy you don't have to read the same five books everyone tells you to read just think of a topic you want to learn about like cleaning now Google books about cleaning here's one that looks good usually these books cost money but if your finger slips you might accidentally end up on this website and you might accidentally search for the title of the book and by chance click on the first link and oh no accidentally downloaded a file and opened it with the appropriate ebook viewer well now that you have the book you'll also find that not only can you pick out interesting tidbits to use in conversations but you can also learn many useful skills there are 10 things you should know before you learn a skill one unless you practice the skill your brain will think it's useless and forget it two you only have have to know 20% of the knowledge to master 80% of the skill so I guess we could just move on this is called the learning curve it's a graph of how good you get at a skill over time as you can see just by practicing a little bit you can make a lot of progress in the beginning but you have to practice no one ever learned how to tie a tie by watching how to tie a tie you only learn how to tie a tie by watching how to tie a tie while tying a tie the same applies to reading books only make you smarter if you give your brain a reason to remember the stuff in the book so once you read the chapter on cleaning a bedroom go ahead and clean a bedroom doesn't even have to be your bedroom just clean one and now you'll never forget it but let's just imagine that's something that you can't practice right now like imagine you're reading a book about cars and then you see this diagram of how to jump start a dead car with a good car ideally you'll read about it and then go practice it but not everyone has two cars lying around to practice on but you can still practice it by just imagining imagine the moment where you'll need to know how to jump start a car put yourself in the situation find a video and pretend that's your car by imagining the whole process from start to finish you just convinced your brain that you used all that information and now you'll remember it meanwhile the person who just looked at the diagram and tried to memorize it still won't know what to do if they ever had to jump start a car this is how you get smart use everything you learn and if you can imagine yourself in the moment where it'll be useful this is basically how the entire school system works you learn a piece of information and because it'll be like 15 years before you actually use it your teacher creates an imaginary situation where that information is useful that is a test an exam that has questions on that exact piece of information and if you get it wrong you fail or in South Korea you get prison time just kidding that's only if you cheat this is usually in enough to make your brain at least attempt to remember the information the only problem is once the test is over your brain says it's not useful anymore and you forget it some people think repetition or space repetition or studying in intervals or mind mapping will help them get better grades and learn faster but in reality doing practice questions will give you the most results because they simulate the actual situation in which you'll need to use what you learned if you don't have any practice questions make your own and convince yourself that the stakes are high like pretend that you're hanging off a cliff by one arm and someone's there to pull you up but only if you can name all the parts of a human cell learning information and making it seem useful to your brain is all you need to get smart and this is why textbooks are the S tier format for becoming smart as fast as possible there's no fluff no handholding no distractions just pure information and a bunch of practice questions and if you can't solve them you have to flip all the way to page XXX VV I II in the appendix to get help textbooks aren't for the Casual learner because it's not as fun as watching a YouTube video on the topic and forgetting it all an hour later but if you're ever up to the challenge there is a website you might accidentally end up on where you could accidentally download free textbooks on any subject you want but before you do",non-well-being
i bet you wish you were as lucky as this guy hey sir congratulations on winning the jackpot lottery here's your check for one billion dollars oh finally man thank you so much i just want to say that i wish i saw this youtube video with this asian guy with glasses that talks about the nine highest paying jobs without a college degree because if i saw that and i wouldn't be riddled with student debt right now um but it's fine i have a i have a degree and i'm working a minimum wage job still everything's fine and this this check this check is going to help out a lot by the way with my student debt hey friends vincent here and my goal is to make personal finance accessible through bad jokes and puns and the reality of the matter is that the cost of college is too damn high people are drowning in hundreds of thousand dollars in debt even before they start the first day of work so if you don't want that to happen to you but you still want to make a ton of money then good news you don't need college to make a boatload of money did you know that the national median salary is a little under 40 000 so i went ahead and i hand carry the top nine highest paying jobs that pays double what the national median salary is and there's even a couple of jobs that pay well over 100 000 and all these jobs do not require all together now without any degree without any degrees really guys that was that was really sad and horrible they don't require a degree there that's that's what i get for trying to have a little bit of pizzazz now although i went to college a lot of my friends didn't and they're still doing great in life and yes some of them even have the jobs that i'm going to be talking about and some of them even make more than me if you're on the fence of going to college or if your immigrant parents like mine are pressuring you to go to college by saying you won't make enough money without a degree definitely check out this video first to see what your options are and although these jobs don't require degrees some of them may still require some certification or training but still all this in the grand scheme of things is a lot cheaper and a lot quicker than going to college electrical repairs have a median annual salary of eighty two thousand seven hundred and eighty dollars and on the high end one hundred and ten thousand one hundred and ten dollars before i tell you what they do did you ever wonder what those little sticks in the ground are called well this is called a tree but this is called a power line and these guys carry electricity all to your home and if one of them snaps well then this happens okay guys seriously can we turn the lights back on i just watched paranormal activity electronic repairers are responsible for testing maintaining and repairing power equipment around the city because modern infrastructure is entirely dependent on electricity so you'll be going around and inspecting electrical equipment to make sure everything is gucci and if something breaks down then who you gonna call ghostbusters no no no guys come on get with the program who are you gonna call electronic repairers there we go this job is a good fit for people who can read and digest work information because you could be working on different equipment every day you also want to be able to solve problems very quickly on the spot and have some really steady hands and if you don't then well you should probably check out the next job to be making that sweet 82k salary you'll need a high school diploma and potentially complete an apprenticeship or other employer training program which could last up to three years power plant operators have a medium annual salary of 84 650 with a high of 129 530 dollars and if you ever watch homer simpsons then you pretty much have a day in the life of a power plant operator minus the nuclear part you'll be working in a control room just like homer to monitor and control different systems that produces electricity basically you'll be managing the source of the power before it gets to the city for the electrical repairs that we've just talked about previously this job is really good for people who are good at communicating and solving problems because if there is an issue then you'll need to work through it with your team since the entire city or the entire state is dependent on you for power you should also be comfortable working in high pressure and really stressful environments which now that i think about it is the complete opposite of homework maybe that's why he wasn't very good at his job you'll typically need a high school diploma or equivalent for this job or even be certified hold on even be certified through the north american electric reliability corporations system operator certification program or nyers ska cup nice scop next up is elevator installer and repairs and fun fact one of the scenarios that i play over and over in my head that gives me a ton of anxiety is going into a crowded elevator with a bunch of people where you're shoulder to shoulder and you really have to use the bathroom and then all of a sudden the elevator stops working that gives me so much anxiety just thinking about it so elevator people please do a good job here please the elevator folks would be maintaining installing and fixing elevators and escalators and you'll be working with different components from brakes control systems and even repair cables and for this you get a wonderful median annual salary of eighty eight thousand five hundred and forty dollars with a high of a hundred and twenty eight thousand 500 this job is a good fit for people who have a good grasp of wiring and machinery are persistent have a high attention to detail and are really good at problem solving to be an elevated person employers typically require at least a high school diploma and potentially an apprenticeship program and all the job training and depending on your state you might also need a license to operate computer programmers have a median salary of eighty nine thousand one hundred ninety dollars and on the higher end one hundred forty six thousand and fifty dollars now true story in between jobs for a few months actually taught myself some computer programming languages like python html and css thinking that it'd be nice to be a computer programmer and have all that flexibility but fast forward a few weeks i finally landed my first interview and you'll never guess what had happened i was prepping for a few days you know i was trying to get confident and i was feeling good but on the day of the interview i was super nervous mom spaghetti and i had a complete brain fart a brain freeze and literally forgot everything and i had to leave the interview super embarrassed and i was apologizing profusely now you didn't ask for the story but i wanted to share the lesson that i learned which is to never give up because and you won't believe this again a few weeks passed i got another interview different company and i did so well at this programming interview that i got the job and i was promoted to the chief technical officer on my second day i'm just kidding i never applied to another programming role after that again i was scared for life and i closed that chapter sometimes there's just no lessons to be learned computer programmers create write and test programming code that allows applications to be run in in order to be a computer programmer you'll need to learn some languages and no english doesn't count it has to be a computer programming language like c python or java to be a good programmer you have to be really good at problem solving being able to understand technologies and systems and logic and having a basic understanding of math like add subtract divide multiply despite what you might think you actually don't need any degrees you can learn everything you need to know online for free or you can go to a paid coding bootcamp which are much cheaper in short in college and i actually had several friends that went through boot camp and they actually really really enjoyed it and they said the best part is at the end of the bootcamp they actually bring in companies that are looking to hire computer programmers so a ton of them actually graduate with a job already in hand next is distribution manager and they're in charge of coordinating planning and directing the transportation of all goods for a company like if your company sells sofas then you're responsible for getting the sofa from china to retail stores in the united states efficiently and cost effectively so you're basically nick fury where you coordinate plan and direct avengers to kill evil things and protect earth but just a little bit less cool in real life now i always thought that this was automated but it's actually pretty manual and hey i can't complain it pays really well with the median salary of ninety seven thousand three hundred and forty dollars and a high end of a hundred and sixty nine thousand five hundred and ninety dollars you'll be a good fit for this job if you have really good problem solving skills have high attention to detail you handle your stress well and you're able to cooperate with a bunch of different people you don't need a degree for this 97k job but you should have a high school diploma have multiple years of working or managing a warehouse and have a really good understanding of shipping technology today next up is database manager with a whopping median salary of 98 860 dollars and on the high end 155 660 database managers organizes and stores data which is immensely important nowadays when everything done is based on data you need to make sure that the company data is available to those who need access and not accessible to those who don't need it and at the same time you need to be able to strategize disaster recovery plans upgrade databases and constantly test new software because this industry is a growing at unprecedented rates this job is really good for people who have a really good visual understanding of things they can see hidden patterns they have some basic math skills and are just super dependable people similar to computer programming although you don't need a degree employers do want to see at least a high school diploma and at least some classes or courses in database development however the most important thing that they want to see is you having experience in database languages such as sql or sql construction managers will be planning supervising and coordinating entire construction projects from the flow of workers materials budget to scheduling and construction workers is a really perfect blend if you have a general interest in building a design and this blended job has a absolute crazy median salary of a hundred and two thousand nine hundred eighty dollars with a high of one hundred fifty nine thousand four hundred and seventy this job is a perfect fit for people who have great communication leadership organization and problem solving skills because you're pretty much going to be using that every single day but the absolute most important thing for a construction manager is to have extensive extensive on-the-job experience or be heavily specialized in the trade you can also make yourself more attractive by getting a certification in construction management next up is a computer security analyst reporting for duty security analyst your mission is to briefly protect your company's networks from outside intruders think of yourself as gatekeepers where you'll be monitoring and responding to data breaches and cyber security attacks thank you sir and for being a protector of the internet your median salary is a whopping 130 590 and on the high end 163 300 although some companies prefer a degree many don't require one and they just want some prior experience and some certification and the last highest paying job without a degree is an air traffic controller with a median salary of one hundred and thirty thousand four hundred twenty dollars and on the high end 184 thousand seven hundred and eighty dollars air traffic controllers direct air traffic from the ground and the air and make sure that people take off and land safely and efficiently to minimize any delays this job is the absolutely ultimate domino effect because think about it if anything is delayed in one airport let's say jfk if flight is delayed then that will disrupt air travel throughout the entire country and even parts of the world this job is a perfect fit for people who have really good communication and organization skills they can pay attention to details and they're able to very quickly think on your feet now you don't absolutely need a degree but it is preferred to have an associate's degree from an air traffic training initiative but you can also be considered if you have three years of progressively responsible work experience you'll also need to pass the air traffic controller specialist skills assessment battery as well as take the air traffic controller training course at the faa academy as you can see a college degree isn't necessary to make a high salary in fact these are only some of the highest paying jobs out there which you can get out of high school and with some additional training and maybe certification there are a ton more high-paying jobs out there and depending on where you live you may or may not have some of these opportunities like i know some of these jobs like the air traffic controller you might need to relocate to a city that actually offers this role one thing i want you to take away from this video is that there are a ton of options out there there is no right or wrong path and i don't want you to feel like going to college is the only right path out there maybe some of these jobs speak to you and maybe they don't and that's okay if you're still searching there is absolutely nothing wrong with that just make sure you're constantly exposing yourself to as many things as possible so that one day you can be expired to choose the right path for you and just the fact that you're even watching this video is a fantastic start you don't need to follow the traditional path from high school to college to make it nowadays you have a ton of options available now and if you're immigrant parents or just parents in general are pressuring you to go to college maybe you can show them the list these lists of jobs where you can earn a ton more than people coming straight out of college and you won't be riddled with debt and remember just because these jobs don't require a degree it doesn't mean that they're easy to get they will require a lot of time a lot of preparation and even maybe money to get started because you need to get certification and go through training getting these jobs is not easy but nothing in life that's worthwhile is normally easy but one thing is for sure if you do successfully get one of these jobs then your return on investment will be huge already especially with the median salary that's already double the national median salary now for me if i didn't have this youtube channel or if i didn't go to college if i had to completely start over from zero i would have chose the computer at the same time with all this flexibility i would be working on my own little projects that hopefully would become bigger,non-well-being
"if you ever have to flee an airport don't run out of departures because that's we're expecting you to go go down to arrivals because a lot of other people coming in there it's always a floor under under departures [Music] we're talking about the early 70s and back at this time and like all teenagers i absorbed the counter culture as much as i could and thought that revolution was what was expected to fight back against any authority i went to a a private school but it was terrible it was all boys and boring well i was asked to find another school over an incident with the chemistry teacher he accused me of wanting to make up a batch of lsd of all things but really i didn't quite fit into that this was a time when drug use was not particularly underground my my mother's friends were pot smokers and i wasn't even a regular smoker but on the the melbourne and the australian drug scene hard drugs were not massively distinguished between anything else cocaine and heroin were just some things that were also available a girl i knew worked at a cinema a boyfriend was a safe cracker when i got to know these guys they retired from safe cracking it was they were too well known and they used to buy up a whole lot of grass and weed when they could and some hash but they didn't have any way of getting anything bigger and they were saying that it was really impossible for them to bring it in and being a little smart ass that i was i thought really and so that was the attraction i'd left my day job and had to get funded by one of the guys from the safecrackers group now he gave me a few thousand dollars and and really didn't hold out much hope that anything would come of it how did it work in my case badly i made as every conceivable mistake possible when i first landed in india in search of hashish to get things going i got swindled outside american express by some con men there you know offering discount rates then couldn't find a good connection i even turned to the shoeshine boys on the street who managed to score me some pretty rough edge but smokeable sort of hash but persistence and time will lead you to the connections you need to make i had so much to learn i was lucky i survived a lot of errors i arrived back in sydney with almost six kilos of hash at that time there was um they didn't use the systems that they developed it was just one guy behind a a desk and he unzipped my case asked me where i'd been of course and he looked inside inside there was a 1950s grunting radio a big old thing that had once had tubes and dials and levers inside but now had nothing there was no clever packing in this one it was the hash bricks were just wrapped up stuffed inside stuff so firmly the casing was buckled at the top this customs officer knew perfectly well i mean he even spun the dial of the radio and it kept on spinning no levers moved he knew what it meant he looked around to see if anybody was watching because he wanted to let me go and he looked at me rather firmly and said are you going back there no no no we'll see that you don't and you can take your uh radio we'll call it and get going what this family man didn't want was to propel me into the jail system the world of prisons i guess he was experienced enough to know what that would mean but you can imagine for somebody [Music] just turned 19 as i bounced out of the airport terminal thinking myself the cleverest smuggler around in fact just some halfway that been given a break i began a series of operations with um a series of drug runs where i was taking it myself my wife at the time an italian girl who father had restaurants she was honored me not to be doing it myself so i found helpers couriers i found one in what turned out to be the best courier i'd ever had this guy ran a couple of plant shops um she she over decorated things with venus fly traps and crawling pumps and things he ruined them he was just a spender of money it was perfect for me and he could imagine himself in different worlds i had peter once run we went out of bangkok he had two kilos the swap was done and he arrived at belgium the system then was to change passports in europe so that your endpoint in this case it was a transfer in the uk you would arrive with documentation that said you'd only been in europe and i watched peter arrive now without any suggestion from me he turned himself into what was clearly a professional tennis player he arrived in white shorts and t-shirt uh even had the racquet in his hand and it was an expensive one he was giving the mx card i'd given him for expenses a thorough bashing on that one and i asked him what he was thinking as he came through untouched of course he said i was thinking of the matches i've won and the games i've played and this was the kind of person who made perfect couriers how did you move into the position where you could actually be arrested and imprisoned in australia what was the journey there the end came about in australia due to arrogance i was still after all only in my early twenties what did i have hmm i had a office a couple of houses spent money carelessly but not publicly but i'd been reported now i knew the police were following me because in those days before encrypted radio signals we could listen in on them when the day came that um i write back home and said to my wife clearly hey some poor guy being watched in the area grab my hand held and go out and take a look maybe i can tip him off i threw the handheld in the car switched the remote control for the garage door and on the radio said yeah the garage door is coming up i said what a break the guy's going out just now i'll really be able to watch him i had the lcd is backing out we can see the ford and he's got a ford so i'm starting to realize that this is me being watched and there were no slouch operatives and i was given 15 years of which i had to do 10.
at the end of a long sentence the usual course is that people in low security prisons and go home to a welcoming family though i had the welcoming family it wasn't the usual path i was at a very low security prison but i was being followed from my day leaves home police were watching me they had even visited me to say that they kind of missed the old days when they used to chase me around and i found that when i got home they were there when i rented a flat they were there they'd leave little notes and abusive messages on my answer phone i couldn't move without them so i backed away and i left the country because i knew it would never end with them the plan was to go to europe to come back to london i'd had a few things here i had a safety deposit box here so a little money but most of it was in thailand because i'd taken it back there with my friend lee my contact there it was a very odd thing to arrive in thailand i'd taken such precautions to get there i two false passports that i'd gone through virtually from the grave up from the the death certificates and birth certificates nobody could know that i was leaving because that would be the end too after three days of unknown freedom in thailand i went to the airport to continue my journey i went to the check-in desk and handed over my passport and i was already getting an odd feeling but who doesn't at an airport check-in and then she cross-checked against a list and she said i just a minute i have to check something she walked away with that passport there are moments when in the blinking of an eye you know that everything you have done has failed i looked up i could see a railing a couple of uniform guys watching me i could see some plain clothes watching me and actually froze for a minute because there was no of course there was a theoretical backup plan there there has to be the second passport but it was just to walk away from everything again i'd lost one life a second life the one that i just left in australia but i didn't really have time to take a think about that i did back off i picked up my travel bag the important one with the money in the second passport and went down to arrivals if you ever have to flee an airport don't run out of departures because that's we're expecting you to go go down to arrivals because a lot of other people coming in there it's always a floor under under departures i found a taxi in the middle of a scrum of probably hundreds and through a lot of argument with his fellow drivers bribed my way back onto the highway going into town driving back there even with the window open my head was burning with rage that i can't tell you how careful i'd been i thought i'd been so that nobody could detect where i was arriving back into the city i took two talks in a motorcycle as well go to a travel agency we knew uh old players retired a little travel agency in bangkok i could use their phone and maybe work out where to go next as i arrived there in an arcade having and all these steps to lose people i see a pile of cigarette butts opposite but you take these things in the corner of your eye as i walked into the treble agency and headed for the phone i could feel the swing of the door behind me in the air coming in and i connected it with a cigarette butt somebody been standing there waiting somebody knew that's where i'd go to i turned and there were three plainclothes thai police they said various things but it didn't matter one had a gun but there's nothing i could do about that take it out and shoot myself it's the only shot i'd get off as i was taken into chinatown police station i saw the american dea agent that i knew from the australian case bill shenman and a couple of australian faces that uh no doubt liaison staff after arrest you spend seven days in the local police cells then you get transferred to a court and that not going well and it never does you go to the main prison i learned many and terrible things about the thai courts that virtually everybody is found guilty you can fight your case and it means you take longer up to five years even pleading to a case takes a year and a half but i couldn't do that i was charged with the false passport um the money which was now written up as uh four thousand dollars seemed to have disappeared and they'd done a little sweep of the airport and found enough drugs to see me face the death penalty it only takes over 25 grams for an airport case and that will put you on death row i would be found guilty as and within two weeks sentenced to death from the moment i stepped into that prison in bangkok escape was on my mind i had my nose glued to the cracks in the cell bar on the sleeping guard probably 60 feet down the way but the first stroke of that tungsten steel on these old bars seemed to carry throughout the whole building in an escape there's one thing for sure everybody is alone up until this point everything's okay you know we go to the baggage thing our bags ain't coming yeah everybody else has got the bags right and then the police just come around with guns and save tamira you boom hands up in the air",non-well-being
"Hi, I'm Anne De Luca, and I'm the Associate Dean for Admissions and Financial Aid at Harvard College. We know that there are a lot of pieces to the application and we ask you for a lot of information that can feel really overwhelming, but we don't want it to. This video is going to break down all of the different components, and we're going to do a deep dive into the Harvard supplement. When we're making admissions decisions and talking about applicants, we're looking at lots of different information. We're looking at your academic information, your extracurricular experiences, what your goals are for college, and what you're hoping to get out of the experience. This is really a chance for you to tell us about yourself, and you want to be sure that who you are and what you've done comes through in a really authentic voice. That means you're going to want to spend time on all of the different pieces and maybe ask someone to help you look it over. Make sure that it reflects who you are and what your goals are for your education and the future. If you're planning to apply for financial aid and the application fee is a barrier for you, don't worry. We have fee waivers that will take care of the application fee so you can apply without any cost to you or your family. Take a look at the link below, and there will be details about how to request a fee waiver. Hi, I'm Joyce St. John, director of admissions at Harvard College. So, where do we begin? First, you need to fill out an application. At Harvard, you have two options: The Common Application or the Coalition Application powered by Scoir. Each application includes biographic information, a family section, and some information about your educational journey. You can include testing information as well if you wish, but remember, Harvard is test-optional, so it’s up to you whether or not to include that information. In whichever application you choose, there will be an activity section. That’s a place where you can let us know about the things you do outside of the classroom. These things could include school activities, sports, music, family obligations, or work obligations. Don't worry about the number of activities you list—just be sure to tell us about the activities that have the most meaning to you. A great place for you to let your voice shine is through the personal essay. Don’t overthink which topic to choose. Pick a topic that matters to you. This will let the admissions committee get to know you better. So you've been through all of the common parts of the application, and now we come to the last piece of the application, which is the supplement. Many schools will have supplements and ask you for additional information beyond the general application. Harvard is no different. We have a supplement where we're going to look for details that aren't asked about in the common part of the application and some specific essay questions that give you more opportunity to tell us about who you are and what you've done. The first question is: Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a diverse student body. How will the life experiences that shape who you are today enable you to contribute to Harvard? In this question, we're hoping you can do some self-reflection and try to identify the experiences in your life that have really influenced who you are, what you believe, what you think is important, and what you want to study. The second question is: Briefly describe an intellectual experience that was important to you? The foundation of your college education is the intellectual experience you'll have with our faculty and with your classmates. So, tell us a little bit about what excites you intellectually in your high school experience? This could be a class, a project, research experience, or a summer opportunity—whatever makes you excited about learning is what we're hoping to find out about in this question. The third question asks you to briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who you are. For this question, my tip would be to pick one activity that is very meaningful to you—something that you participate in outside of the classroom. This could be an extracurricular activity, but it could also be a work obligation or your family responsibilities. The fourth question is: How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future? First of all, I want to say that we’re not going to hold you to the answer to this question. It's OK to change your mind between now and when you graduate from college. That said, we are looking to get a sense for how you think a college education might help you fulfill your goals and your dreams for the future. We’re confident that we can provide you with the right education and community to make those dreams a reality. So, tell us a little bit about that, whether it's a very detailed vision or just a broader sense of what you're hoping to accomplish. The last question asks you to identify the top three things your roommate might like to know about you. Residential life is an essential part of the Harvard experience. In this question, we’re curious to see how you might present yourself to another first-year student. Imagine you're in the dining hall for the first time, and you meet someone new. What three things would you really want that person to know about you? Some students feel like there’s additional information they want the committee to see that doesn't really fit well into the common part of the application or the supplement. If you do have supplementary materials to share, you can do so through SlideRoom if you're sharing artistic things like paintings, drawings, performances, or through our application status portal if you're sharing research papers or posters. So this rounds out all of the pieces of the application you'll complete, but there is additional information that you'll ask others to send on your behalf. You’ll ask for your high school to send an official transcript. This is a listing of all the coursework you've taken and your performance in those courses. You’ll also have a counselor letter of recommendation. In the U.S., this is from someone who is a counselor at your school who knows you well and can share information about your accomplishments, your experiences, activities, and your goals for the future. In some cases, you may not have a counselor who's able to write a letter on your behalf, and that's OK. You can have another adult who knows you well write for you in this space. Harvard requires two teacher recommendations as part of your application. This is usually a teacher you've had in the last year or two, and they’ll be able to talk about your experiences in their classroom and your preparation for college-level coursework. This doesn't have to be from your hardest classes, and it doesn’t have to be from the classes where you've necessarily gotten the best grades. These should be from teachers who know you well, who understand your intellectual experiences, and can talk about your curiosity, the way you engage with your classmates, and your performance in those classes. Congrats, you've submitted your application, but you're not done yet. There are a few things we’re going to ask for along the way in your final year of school. First is a mid-year report, which is a request to see your transcript after your first term in your senior year. This is going to show the coursework you've taken and the grades you’ve earned, usually by the end of December or the beginning of January. If you're admitted, we’ll ask for your final transcript, which will show the remaining coursework you've taken and your final performance in those courses. Or if you're in a country that has national exit exams, your performance in those exams. As part of the application process, you might be offered an alumni interview. This is an excellent opportunity for you to talk to someone who went to Harvard, for them to get to know you, and for you to ask questions about their experience. You can read more about that on our website. All of these pieces come together to provide a complete picture of who you are and how you hope to engage in our college community. I hope you decide to apply to Harvard, and if you do, we look forward to reading your application.",non-well-being
I have spent the last decade of my life immersing  myself in the field of finance and money through a   degree in finance a qualification in accounting  and then a career in Investment Banking and one   of the most life-changing skills I have learned  through it all is how to handle my own finances   recognize my bad money habits and break free from  them so in this video I'm going to share with you   nine of the most common bad money habits that  hold people back and tips on how to break out   of them number one paying yourself last I first  heard of this in the book Rich Dad Poor Dad by   Robert Kiyosaki and it's one of the blueprints in  achieving Financial Freedom Robert explains that   the way people pay their bills can be broken down  into two types the first way is the Poor People's   habit and that is through paying yourself last  so as soon as your paycheck comes in you then   pay your rent your phone bill your subscriptions  you find your social plans and then you'll save   whatever's left over if there is even any money  left to save the second method he talks about is   the rich people's habit and they do the complete  opposite they pay themselves first and that is   what you want to do take 10 minimum and put that  into your savings account the minute you get paid   treat it like paying a bill this is so important  and by doing this you're guaranteeing that that   buying their things before you pay yourself the  second bad money habit is getting comfortable   with bad debt it seems that debt these days is  actually the norm people are using debt to by   the smallest of things to buy presents to buy  clothes I have a straight wall that is unless   I can afford to pay for that thing outright and  cash I shouldn't be buying it with any form of   debt remember credit card companies want you to  be bad with your finances because that's how they   make money from this the average credit card  interest rate is 22 which cancels all kind of   benefits and rewards these credit card companies  are providing if you're not able to pay them off   number one which is about paying yourself first  and essentially it's saving enough so that you   this six months of buffer it's through that paying  yourself first start putting that 10 away and once   you have your stockpile then you can start using  the additional money you save to building into   your investment fund and looking at Investments  number four is not knowing your income or expenses   properly until you know what your starting point  is how do you know where you want to be there's   something called lifestyle inflation and that is  your spending will rise as your income Rises the   more money you make the more you spend and it's  a cycle make more money buy a bigger house buy a   financially they know their assets they know their  liabilities they have a clear goal on where they   want to go financially and all this all the steps  they need to take to get there are more likely to   get a lot of money and build wealth compared  to people who just fantasize about money but   have no idea how to go about it how they plan to  acquire it or how to manage it just being mindful   of their stuff and seeing those numbers in black  and white will trigger you into action fifth bad   money habit is having expensive Hobbies a lot of  people like to shop and I guess yeah part of this   if you want to improve your financial position you  can firstly save more of your existing income or   you can make more money and create more income  streams and the ideal combination is a mixture   of both you can't build wealth if you're making  more money and spending all but you also can't if   you're just focusing on the saving side because  there is a cap to how much you can save using   those cashback sites will only get you so far so  to truly build wealth you have to think of both   sides of the equation both how you will save a  larger percentage of your income but also how   you will make more money saving moneyside has a  cap the making money side does not it's infinite   there is unlimited potential upside whether it's  investing in the stock market asking for a pay   rise starting a side hustle you want to break the  bad money habit of thinking about saving money   is going to massively increase your wealth number  seven paying too much in taxes taxes are going to   be the single biggest expense in your life whilst  everyone has to pay tax a lot of people just   wealthy they have knowledge of illegal corporate  structures that come with tax advantages they hire   tax advisors that help them minimize their tax  bills so if you want to get one step ahead one of   the best ways to increase your wealth is through  understanding tax rules in a way that's stack up   in your favor for example investing through  an Isa or a Roth IRA which is an investment   account that shelters your dividend and profit  from taxes or operating under a business instead   if you are someone who disagrees with this and  prefers to pay more taxes regardless of whether   or not you can reduce it legally then it doesn't  hurt to understand the tax rules and reduce that   tax bill so that you can instead use the money  to give back to things that directly align with   your values instead of letting someone else decide  where that money should be going if you want me to   make a video on tax I was planning to I already  have a summary on what I want to include but I   have been a bit skeptical about whether to release  this it's a topic that can go either way so let   me know in the comments below if you want to see  that number eight waiting too long to invest when   you start having savings you have that stockpile  that buffer that we spoke about then you want to   start looking at investing that money so that  your money starts working for you and you want   to diversify those Investments so you can weather  different situations operations that come around   in life but you want to avoid leaving that money  in a bank account because inflation is a thing   and it means that you're essentially losing money  every year so I have a mixture of safe Investments   of riskier Investments that I'm willing to lose  as well start looking at different investment   strategies once you've saved up enough don't leave  any additional money more than you need to in a   bank account I have another video and what you  can be doing with your money in times like the   current recession and I'll link that here for you  as well there's always going to be reasons why   you can't invest because you don't have time you  don't have enough money you don't know where to   start but the longer you put off investing the  harder you will have to work to get that same   may also

" In this video we're going to give you a basic overview of how to repair a flat tire on a bike. We'll remove the wheel, replace the inner tube, and put it all back together. Hello, Calvin Johnson here with Park Tool Company. First let's go over the tools and supplies needed. Typical tools and supplies will include wrenches as needed to remove the wheel if any. Tire lever is to remove the tire, a pump or CO2 cartridge to re-inflate the tire, and a spare inner tube. When riding, always try to carry a spare tube if you can. In the event of a flat, replace with the spare, and patch the damaged tube later. Learn how to apply an inner tube patch watch this video. If at any point you need a more detailed look at the process happening on screen, click the more info button. Let's get started. First we need to remove the wheel. If you have rim brakes, it doesn't gaze to brake. This may be a quicker lease lever. A linkage that must be manually disconnected or a button at the brake lever. Now we can move the wheel from the frame. It's time to get the inner tube out of the tire. First deflate the tube completely. Push both sides of the tire towards the center of the rim to loosen the bead from against the rim sidewall. Engage a tire lever between the rim and tire bead. Pull down to lift the bead up and over the rim. Take a second lever, up few inches away, and repeat. Continue to feel the bead loosen enough to run the lever under the tire bead. Remove the second bead from the rim using levers as necessary. The tire and tube are now removed from the wheel. Since we recommend always carrying a spare tube, this video walks through the replacement process. If you're looking to repair or patch your inner tube, watch this video. When servicing a flat tire, always inspect the components of the wheel carefully for tears, damage, and foreign objects. Knowing the cause of the flat can help prevent future flats. In most cases, the cause of a flat will be a small puncture in the tube. If the offending object is still present in the tire, find it and remove it. If there are cuts or ribs that go through the casing of the tire, the tire really needs to be replaced. As the temporary fix, we can use the TB tube tire boot. A small puncture through the tire casing won't compromise the tire. And if a larger cut does not break through the casing, the tire should still be okay. Be sure to squeeze the cut and inspect inside for glass or other sharp objects. Now we install the tube. Unfold the inner tube, but just enough air into the tube for it to hold its shape. Install the tube inside the tire. To make it easier to find when inflating the tire, try to line up the valve stem with the pressure recommendations on the tire sidewall. Check for any directional arrows printed on the sidewalls and align the tire with the rim accordingly. Engage the valve stem into the rim, being sure it is aligned so that it will not be crooked. Work one bead at a time onto the rim. After one bead is installed, begin to push the other bead up and into the rim seat. Only if necessary, use tire levers to finish the bead installation. Work with care not to pinch the tube or you may be repeating the entire process. Inspect the wheel to make sure the bead is uniformly seated and the inner tube is not poking out from underneath the tire. Begin to inflate the tire. Add a little bit of air, then spin the wheel to check how the bead is seating. If the bead rises up in one spot, inflate the tire, push it back down to recede the bead. If the tire dips down in one spot, the bead needs to come up. Here some extra inflation can help, but use care not to blow the tire off the rim. If more air pressure does not pop the bead up, you'll place the tire and use the lubricant in that spot such as soapy water. Inflate the tire to full pressure. Tighten the press to valve stem and install any stem nut and valve cap. The wheel is ready to install. We engage the smallest cog onto the chain. See if the axle into the dropouts entitle appropriately. Be sure to re-engage the brake. Firefly the wheel is centered in the frame and the rotor is centered in the caliper, adjust if necessary. That concludes the process for fixing a flat tire. Thanks for watching and be sure to subscribe for the latest videos from Park Tool.",non-well-being
" The map of the world is a lot stranger than you think it is, especially this map. You've probably seen it a lot in classrooms or office buildings, but this map is extremely very badly wrong. As we can all hopefully agree upon, the Earth is a sphere, and that means that it is impossible to accurately depict her surface on a two-dimensional map. This particular common map is called the Mercator projection, and if you'd like to experiment with countries for yourself, please go to this website called thetruesize.com after this video. To see what I'm talking about, let's take the US state of Wyoming as an example. Under the assumption that Wyoming is actually a real place and not a land full of tumbleweeds with a population less than downtown Baltimore, this example will work perfectly because of the state's square shape. As we stack one unit of Wyoming on top of each other, we get more and more distorted as we approach the North Pole to the point where we don't even really recognize its familiar boring shape anymore. When we move our Wyoming stack south, they get more squished together as we approach the equator. This will happen with every other landmass in the world, but first, let's take a look at some other US states. They say that everything is bigger in Texas, but what is Texas itself bigger than? Moving the borders over to Europe, the answer may surprise you. Texas is much bigger than Spain and Portugal put together and is also even bigger than France. But Texas is only the second biggest US state behind Alaska, which seems absolutely gargantuan at the top of our map, but while Alaska is large, it isn't that large. Taking down to the US mainland, it compares like this, and taking to Europe, it looks like this. And while we're here in Europe, let's take the time to understand how much bigger Europe seems than what it actually should be. Let's start by taking France and moving it down to Africa to get our first glimpse at this. The United Kingdom seems pretty large as well, but let's take India and move it over to see just how small it really is. The United Kingdom is actually smaller than quite a lot of places in the world that you might not expect. Places like Japan, the Philippines, Sumatra, Madagascar, and New Zealand. Next door to New Zealand is Australia. In the UK, it looks so small just off the east coast in comparison. And Australia, in fact, is much bigger than most people believe it to be. It can be placed to cover almost the entire continental US. Interestingly, the combination of the following countries will not cover that same area. Portugal, the Netherlands, Estonia, Albania, Hungary, Belgium, Bosnia, and Herzegovina, Austria, Croatia, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Serbia, Switzerland, Slovakia, Lithuania, Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, and Norway. And that's not even factoring in big, but not too big, Alaska to the north. Between Alaska and the United States is Canada, which also seems huge up here. And while Canada is a very large country, it's actually roughly the same size as China. But still looks like a colossus when placed in Europe, where it stretches from east to west to Portugal to Iran and up north into the barren sea just above of Russia. Slightly off topic, Japan is another bigger place than most people believe it to be. If Japan were placed off the US East coast, it would look like this in comparison. But much, much bigger than Japan, and also not often thought about as Brazil, which is an absolutely massive country. It doesn't really look like it on our map, but when we move it to Australia, we can actually discover that Brazil is much bigger, which makes Brazil larger than one of the world's seven continents. Brazil is also almost larger than the United States. Spans almost all of Europe, but fits rather snugly into Africa. We are about to discover that Africa is a colossal continent that we don't often realize. It can almost fit the entire contiguous United States into just the Sahara desert, and the continent can also squeeze in China, Western Europe, India, Argentina, Scandinavia, and the UK and still have some room left over. Russia is another place that looks pretty big at the top of the map, but dropped down next to Africa, she also seems much smaller than what our map was telling us beforehand. While we're still here in Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo used to be a colony of Belgium, but Belgium in comparison looks like this. Finally, we need to look at a few other places on the map to the north and the south. Let's start with Sweden, which looks big, but comparing it to Madagascar again, we see that it actually isn't. Iceland also seems like a large island, but it's actually roughly the same size as Tasmania, just south of Australia. And finally, we have the white elephant in the room of Greenland, which towers like a behemoth at the top of the map. Greenland masquerades as being a continent in her own right, looking bare than Australia, South America, and being comparable to North America. But in reality, Greenland is much much smaller. The globe reveals Greenland to be the island that she pretends that she isn't, and we get a much more accurate depiction this time when we compare her to Australia, South America, and North America. And of course, we can't forget about the most shy continent in the world that everybody always forgets about, Antarctica, who spends her time hiding away at the bottom of the map. Most people don't truly have a good understanding of the size of Antarctica, which could probably go either way between being larger or smaller than you think, but the truth is, Antarctica is a huge continent. It is much bigger than Australia. It can stretch all the way from Kiev to Uganda, and incredibly, can be placed between the southernmost tip of Texas in the United States, and stretch all the way into the northernmost islands of Canada. There are many more examples like this, but you've probably understood the point by now. The world is both a bigger place and a smaller place than you previously thought it to be.

" Do you enjoy aggressively sacrificing pieces? The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Gambit is made for you. You sacrifice tons of material in the opening. But if successful, you're left with a 72% win rate. You will learn how to sacrifice upon, a knight, and a bishop to build up your Intercontinental Ballistic Missile attack that will lead your opponents position in unorganized chaos and destruction. You can start by playing E4 and if they go D5, you can play knight F3. Now, usually they won't play D5, so if you want to make sure that you can play this opening, you can open with knight F3 and they'll likely go D5. Now you can play E4 and achieve the same position as earlier. They take and you attack upon like this. They intuitively try to defend it with their knight. You offer another pawn and they take it. You take back with the bishop. If you were the black pieces in this position, you'd be annoyed by that knight. Correct? That's why most people play H6. Goodbye knight. Except that it's not good by knight. Take on F7, forking the queen in the rook. At this point, taking the knight seems like the only reasonable thing to do. And now it's over. Bishop to G6, a discovered attack on the queen. At the same time, the king isn't check and forced to do any of these three moves. Every single one of them is shattering. Black takes the bishop and you launch your inner continental ballistic missile attack on the enemy queen. From here on, there's just one mistake that you should avoid. I'll show you what mistake I'm talking about. Winning from this position is very easy. You're upping material. Black's position is completely ruined and you're pressuring many pieces. That's the 72% win rate position I mentioned earlier. Only one thing can go wrong. If Black pushes this pawn, don't take the bishop. Otherwise they can play bishop before, check and discover to attack on your queen. Now you're the fool. If you don't fall for this trap you should be able to win this position by yourself. If not, nobody can help you. But wait, look at this horribly grotesque position. If you're anything like me, this looks amazing to you. This guy right here is holding back three points. They're all isolated and here is another double-plung. Phenomenal. This is actually another outcome of the same gambit. The ICBM gambit in this beautiful piece of disgusting trash are both results of the Tennis and Gambit. Subscribe right now because I'll make a guide on that soon.",non-well-being
" This is how ancient debris generates in Minecraft. As you can see, it is the rarest ore to find in the game. It could take your ages to find enough to make a full matter right here. And besides that, you will also need the smithing template, which is even more rare. But don't you worry, because I will show you 4 ways to find ancient debris for your net right here and how to find the smithing template as fast as possible. Are you ready? Let's break it down. There are 4 ways to find net right. Using bats, mining, using TNT and by raiding bastions. Before we start with these 4 methods, let's look at this graph, where you can see where ancient debris spawns. Technically, it can spawn in every while level of the net. But the chances you will find it above while level 22 is so small that it's a complete waste of time to look for it there. The peak is at Y15 and it equally diminishes going more up and down. That's why Y15 is the best layer to look for an ancient debris. Finding ancient debris can take time, but don't worry, because you actually don't need that much of it. You'll need to smell 4 ancient debris for 1 net right to upgrade 1 item. So, for a full matter right armor, you just need to find 16 ancient debris. And for all your tools, including a hoe, you will need 20. So, to create a full matter right gear, you will need to find 36 ancient debris ors. If that sounds like a lot to you, don't worry, because you will see how easy this can be. Number 1, using bats. The first way to find ancient debris is to use bats. This is because you cannot sleep in the netter, and if you will try to do so, you will regret it soon after your bats exploded. But this is exactly where bats are the best and easiest way to look for ancient debris early game, if you take caution doing it. Just take a stack of wool and a stack of wood with you to craft yourself a lot of bats once you are down there. That's more efficient than coming to the netter with your inventory full of bats. You will also need some slabs, one diamond pickaxe and some food. You think this method could give you up to 30 ancient debris per hour? So, get yourself to Y15, but don't just start digging the tunnel yet. Be aware that you don't mind in the basalt delta by him, because basalt takes forever to mine, and doesn't explode as easy as nettering. Also, make sure that you mine on the chunk border. A chunk is a 16x16 segment of a Minecraft world. The thing is, ancient debris or stand to spawn close to chunk borders. So, mining on a chunk border gives you a higher chance of finding ancient debris. To show chunk borders in Java Edition, just press F3 and G, it's as easy as that. On bad rock edition, chunk borders work the same, but the problem is that you cannot show them like in Java Edition. To know if you are on a chunk border in bad rock edition, go to the 050's or the 1.0's in your world. Or just make sure that you can divide your x and z axis by 16. If so, you are on a chunk border. Now, dig a long tunnel on the chunk border. Then, make branches on the sides of the tunnel, but only on the chunk borders. Now, you could just randomly place and explode bats, but that could cause you a lot of health and it's dangerous. But there is a safe way to use bats easily. First, mine all the blocks in front of you, without mining the orcs in front of your feet. Then, place the bat as far as you can. There should now be a free block gap between you and the bat. Now, place one more block to make that gap for blocks longer and dig one block down. Lastly, place a slab underneath you, like the scobalstone slab. If you now stand on that slab and explode the bat, you will take just minimum damage. Even without armor, you just take one and a half heart damage. With iron armor, you take half a heart damage and with diamond armor, you practically don't even take any damage. And besides that, you didn't have to risk the rig at lava over you or catch fire. Now that the bat is exploded, look around for each of the three blocks. As these blocks are fire and blocks resistant and will stay exposed after the explosion. You can also quench some fires around you because sometimes there is an ancient debris block hiding underneath a flame. But don't spend too much time doing this. When you are done, just continue your pop straight. Dig some blocks into the next wall and repeat this process. Whenever you walk into too much lava, you can turn back to your main tunnel and try a different branch. Number 2, mining. Maybe you think mining for ancient debris is a waste of time, but you would be wrong. It totally depends on the tools you have. You shouldn't use this method early game without any enchantments, because mining all the netherrack would take ages. But this is different if you have an enchanted pickaxe. Mining with the right enchantments could give you 40 ancient debris per hour. The free enchantments you should definitely want to your pickaxe are unbreaking three, mending, and efficiency two or higher. The first two are just so that you will only need one pickaxe. The reason you will only need efficiency level two is because this will break netherrack instantly already, just like an efficiency five pickaxe. But still, the higher, the better, especially when you need to mine blackstone. I think this pickaxe will make it very easy for you to dig tunnels through the netherrack. You should mine like you are some kind of digging machine by mining in circles like this. So you are mining a 4x4 area. As you can see, this goes really fast and you will find ancient debris soon. When your pickaxe needs to be repaired, you can use all the ore blocks on your way, like quartz or a star repair it. Just like with the bad method, make sure that you are mining on a chunkboard to increase your chances to find ancient debris. You can just mine in one straight line until you are bombed with lava. Then you can turn and go different directions on the chunkboard. When you bombed with a lot of gravel, you can choose to just go around it or use a good efficiency shovel to go through it. Number 3. Using TNT. The third method is probably the most efficient method. You use TNT to blow up big areas on the ground. Similar as the bad method, but with TNT, you can keep a safe distance and you can make a chain explosion of as many TNT as you like. Well, more like as many TNT as you can, because even though this is the most efficient method, it's by far also the most expensive one. So you won't be able to do this until you've made yourself a gunpowder farm. But if you have one, this is the best method to use, because it could give you up to 70 agents in debris per hour. Using this method, it's better to dig a tunnel at Y13 or Y14 to lower the chances to get these big lava falls over you. Just dig one long tunnel as long as you like. Make sure that you are mining on a chunkboard to increase your chances to find ancient debris. Then place the TNT. You could place them all in one line, but it's more expensive and unnecessary. The best way to place them is this pattern of 1, skip, 2, skip, 1, skip, 2, skip. This way you get a maximum explosion impact with less TNT. Line up the last TNT and get a safe distance. Once your TNT is exploding, follow the explosions and look for revealed ancient debris ors. But be careful for big lava falls. As you can see, you will find ancient debris spread around this new big tunnel as you made. Now you just have to mine it. But whether you like it or not, you will need to find at least one bastion and raid it if you want to have Naderite gear. Because these are the only places where you can find a smithing template to upgrade your diamond gear into Naderite gear. It might not be the most sustainable way to look for ancient debris, but while you are opening all these chests in these bastions, you have a chance to find ancient debris ors, Naderite scraps, or even Naderite Ignites in these chests. Sometimes even multiple Naderite Ignites in one chest. That chance that you find these various part type of bastion. But I will cover all of that in another video. For now, it's most important to know how to find the smithing template. Bastions are found all over the Nader, except in the basalt delta biome. To find one, you just need to explore the Nader. However, if you find a Nader fortress, there will be no bastion close by. An easy way to explore the Nader is by riding a strider on the lava. Place a saddle on the strider and use a Fungion to stick to riding. When you found the bastion, you need to know that there are 4 types of bastions. Bridges, vocalist tables, hosting units, and the treasure room. You have a 10% chance to find the smithing template when you open any chest. However, there is one chest in a treasure room that has a 100% chance to contain this smithing template. So ideally, you want to find a treasure room bestian. You can easily recognize them by their shape. Two big colossal black boxes and a bridge that connect them with these lava pools underneath it. When you enter the lower box of these two, you can look down and see a lot of gold blocks in one place. In one of these chests there, you will have a guaranteed smithing template. If you didn't find a treasure room bastion, just explore the one you have found in the open chest there. Because you still have a 10% chance to purchase the find one. But if you are a bit lazy, you can use this website called chunkbase.com. You can copy your seed in here, select the version you have, and click on the net of dimension. Here you can see the pickling icons with a chest on it, which are the treasure room bastions close to you. Just check the coordinates and copy it or write it down. For more help with finding which seed you have, check out the description. Bastions are dangerous places, mostly because of the pickling bruise. They will always attack you, no matter what kind of armor you are wearing. They are very strong and can kill you in a few hits. And to make it worse, they will disable your seed for 5 seconds if you try to block their attack. And if you hit them, you will also anger the normal piglets around you. And that can make things even more complicated. So getting to the smithing template could be very challenging. But you can make it a lot easier for yourself, by bringing a bucket of lava with you and one or two stacks of building blocks, like that a rack. Be aware of your surroundings and make sure you have space to pile up. When you see or hear a pickling brood, pile up at least two blocks. And more is safer of course. Make sure it cannot reach you from the side or something. Then just throw your lava bucket on the pickling brood where it's standing. He will slowly die in a lava, but you don't anger the other piglets around you. Just continue doing this and make your way to the chest. You can do all of this easier and safer when you enter from the roof. You make your way down slowly and you will have enough space to pile up if necessary. When you are down there and open the chest, you will anger all the piglets around you. But you can avoid it by placing blocks around you and the chest so the piglets won't see you opening it. In another video, I will show you how to completely raid the bastion. But for now, just take the template and leave carefully. Now you have all your ancient debris and your smithing template. Now you can smell your ancient debris and use the Netaraj caps that come out together with gold to create a Netaraj Ignite. Use the smithing template to upgrade your diamond gear into Netaraj gear, using a Netaraj Ignite and a smithing template. But remember that you only have one template now and you will need to duplicate it for every armor or tool you want to upgrade. To do that, you will need 7 diamonds and another red block. If you need more diamonds, make sure to watch my next video where I show you the fastest ways to find diamonds. Or watch my other videos about finding iron or gold.

" For bad players who are confused about the middle game like you, the London system might be the perfect opening. You can literally play the exact same moves against anything and always end up in a solid position. But chess page 1, beginners should deeply study the opening, rather than learning this setup. That's what you might think. Turns out, you're wrong. Usually, beginners are surprisingly decent in the opening, but don't know what to do in the middle game. So, if you can force your brain to pay attention for 10 minutes now, you'll learn an opening system that you can play against anything. That way you'll have time to finally learn the middle game. Usually I explain openings in missions, but this time it makes much more sense to learn the ideal setup, then the exceptions of that setup, and then we'll look at two example games that'll show you the main attacking ideas. And my next video will be fully dedicated to the middle game. But now let us learn the London system so you can stop worrying about the opening. Pay attention because in 10 minutes you will basically be Magnus Carlson. First of all, let's talk about the setup. Just follow these steps. D4. Then get the bishop out and push upon. But make sure the bishop is already out. Now develop your knight to F3 and your other knight to D2. Complete the pawn pyramid and put your bishop on D3. This is your ideal setup. But there are some things that you have to know. Let's say the game went like this. You still have the same setup. And black pushes C4, attacking your bishop. Your D3 bishop is supposed to attack the king side castle. So it wants to stay in this diagonal. Just drop it back one square, it's still pointing towards the king side. Let's talk about your knight. I'll take these moves back real quick. Black does some normal development move. These two squares are incredibly important. That's why your pawns, bishops and knights mission is to attack on E5. How your horse can jump there, well protected, nice. This is your main attacking idea. Most people capture right away. And you recapture with the plunge. Obviously the knight is under attack and has to retreat, and you play queen h5. Absolutely dominating the king side. I'll show you how to secure the win on the king side with an example game later. This is your ideal attack. It's very common but sometimes things don't go as planned. For example in this position, when you're trying to build your ideal setup, some people go bishop d6, attacking your bishop. Do not trade, they will recapture and you lose all control over E5. Instead, as soon as they offer this trade, just slide your bishop back. And if they take, you recapture. Opening the file for your rook. Now you will have even more control over the king side. And the last thing before we will look at an example game, if they ever play bishop f5. Taking control over this diagonal. Don't let your bishop sit and wait. Immediately challenge the control. But don't initiate the trade. Let them take first and recapture with the queen. Threat neutralized. And now let's take a look at an example game. d4d5. Bishop out. Some black move and d3. The first half of the pawn pyramid. Black develops the knight and white does the same. Now white's next move is to develop the second knight and believe it or not. A common move that you will see everyone's in a wall is bishop before. Tending your knight. Obviously you continue your normal plan, just push c3. The bishop has to retreat. And finally, bishop d3. Your ideal setup is complete. Black castles. White has full control over e5 and perfectly executes the knight attack. Of course black immediately dakes. White recaptures. Attacking the knight. The horse jumps off. Everything is going as planned. And here comes, queen h5. The perfect attack. This would be checkmate. And the most common way to defend it is to push g6. But now you can place your queen very comfortably. The king is silently crying right now. But there's not much to do. So black pushes c5. Hoping to gain an advantage on the queen side. But white plays h4. The attack is rolling. There's no turning back. c4. Drop your bishop back. And knight c5. Oh no, has black discovered a weakness? This week's square is double attacked. Black can position a knight behind our pawn structure. Oh no, anyway. Push the pawn. You have a superior attack. Black positions the knight. Which is kind of annoying because it's blocking your bishop, that way reducing your dominance on the king side. But white takes the l and captures the knight. It's not too bad. Now it's attacking time. White captures. And oh, what is this? The check made in one? The best move is literally to throw the queen in the way. The rook takes it. Now moving the rook like this stops made in one because after the queen captures, the king can go here. Just to be made it anyway. But before you go off and try to play this, obviously your game will not always go as planned. So let's take a look at another example game that shows the most common alternatives. It starts with d4 and now e6. Oh no, a completely different starting move. Well, the good news is, you can play the London anyway. So get your bishop out. And oftentimes what you will see is that they end up playing something like d5 anyway, so it's not even a new position. Push e3, everything is going as planned. But now bishop d6. You probably remember that I told you to drop your bishop back. If you do that, they're likely capture it. Now you can recapture, opening the rook file. Pay attention, if your opponent makes a tiny mistake, he's in big trouble. Just if all you should complete your setup. They castle, you develop your knight and a few moves later your setup is complete, nothing special, you know this by now. By the way if black puts the queen here, please don't blunder your plunge. Use your wife as a human shield to protect the peasants. And if they capture, you have another open rook file. But let's go back. If you have this setup, many beginners and even advanced players fall for a very easy attack. Black makes some normal move, not anticipating the big attack. What you want to do here, is the exact same thing as earlier. You bring your knight to e4. And again, by far the most common move is to capture the knight. But that's a mistake. You take with the plunge. Now this knight is under attack. But this is the very knight that's defending the pawn, which is double attack right now. Black retreats the knight. And now the pawn isn't defended anymore, you can take. Boom, check. The king flees. And here comes the queen. Your very common move for you, you will often play queen h5. And here black decides to go for the counter attack. The pawn is under attack, but a long castle solves the problem. The queen attacks another pawn. But the king moves again. And black pushes the next pawn, committing to the queen side attack. Knight B3, aiming at the queen, hoping that she will retreat. And she actually does retreat. Now white can push more pawns, increasing the king side dominance. It pushes queen side again. And there are many cool moves to play, but our white player finds this one right here. It's actually quite simple. If the king takes it, it's checkmate in one. And if he doesn't take, the queen can take on f7, which is also checkmate. But black finds a move to stop this vicious attack. Rook e7. And white jumps the knight to d4, threatening to take the pawn on c6. That would fork the queen in the rook, a certified by-by moment. It defends the pawn with the rook. In all this chaos, there must be a tactic to win a piece. There must be some way for white to use the high pressure around the king. Let's think hypothetically. If the knight could go to e6, it would fork the king and the queen. Why can't it go to e6? Because e6 is defended by a pawn. Can we get rid of that pawn? Yes. It's sacrifice time. Mr. Bishop I have bad news for you. My plan to victory involves your death. Take the pawn. This is horrible for black. If black doesn't capture the bishop, there's this checkmate pattern, queen g6 and rook h8. So black is forced to take. Allowing the fork. Was this intended? Absolutely not. But did it happen because of our massive king side pressure? Absolutely yes. So are we going to take credit for it and pretend we're brilliant chess players? Absolutely and utterly yes. With the rook now on f7, we can jump to e6. The king has to move. And the knight goes hip-hity hop-ity, your queen is my property. Significantly down in material, the black player decides to take the knight, leaving the rook unprotected. So the queen snacks it. And from here on it's absolute destruction. You will see a few less attempts by black to attack on the queen side. But white is simply stronger. rook h8. The king flees to the only available spot. But now the knight is pinned. So white pushes the pawn, attacking the pin knight. You can't really do anything about it and tries to play on the queen side. White captures the knight and black recaptures. By the way there are multiple force checkmate patterns in this position, but you don't have to always find everything. White just captures a pawn and is still ahead. And black keeps messing around on the queen side. Obviously your game won't go exactly like this, but will summarize your general game plan in a moment. Check. The king runs. Check. The king runs. Check. The king runs. Check. The king runs, out of moves because it's checkmate. So how exactly can you win with the London system? I think the opening is clear at this point. Build your setup and be aware of the few exceptions that I mentioned. But then you enter the middle game. The easy part is over. This is the hard part. Basically there are two factors that will decide if you win or lose. Number 1. The tactics. I can't upload tactical skill into your brain. I'll try to make a helpful video soon. But in the end what matters is that you get practice. Number 2. Your middle game plan. And here I have two aspects for you. Number 1. The quick help. Number 2. The superior help. The quick way to get better is this. Literally move your knight to E5. Wait for them to capture your knight. Take back and bring your queen out. Now keep attacking and maybe you'll find a checkmate at some point. But that's not a middle game strategy. That's just a cool attacking idea. And if the attack fails and you just don't find a cool cheesy attack, you'll sit there with no strategy, not knowing what to do and playing move by move. Why? Because you don't even know what a good move is. Sure you know a fork is a good move, but unless you find a cool tactic, you don't know what a good strategic move is. Like what's the goal here? What do you want to achieve in the middle game?",non-well-being
" Hey everyone and welcome back to Swift Guitar Lessons. Today I'll give you a quick maintenance lesson on how to change a string on an acoustic guitar. To get the job done we're gonna be using these earthwood, Ernie ball guitar strings, my personal favorite, and also this stringwinder just to get those strings on a little faster. Let's get started. Alright so we got a close look at the guitar. We've all been in this situation before. We've just popped in this case our G string. The first thing I need to do is use my stringwinder. Most of these have little notch here for prying up the bridge pin. So that's the first thing I'm gonna do. Pop up the bridge pin, get underneath there, get a little leverage and then out it comes. Okay so this is definitely a great tool to have. I'm gonna take the old string out and discard it. Get my bridge pin back and I pulled the 22 gauge string out of the Ernie ball earthwood light gauge string set. Okay so I'm gonna pop this new string out. It should only take a couple of minutes to get this together. Grab the ball at the end of the string. I'm gonna drop the ball at the end into the bridge and now the fluid at side of my bridge pin is gonna be facing that string while it's inside the bridge. So I'm just gonna push down and also pull up on the string as I push. See we got it. Alright and that sets nice and easy and we're ready to attach it to the tuner. Okay so now that we have the new string inside the bridge we're ready to remove the old string from the tuner. So we just unwind it and pull it right out. Doesn't usually fight too much. Alright we're ready to get rid of this. We're gonna drag our new string up and through the eye hole of our tuner. Okay so having a string winder is going to make this a lot easier. We're just gonna put it right here on the G string tuner knob and turn it counterclockwise. I'm holding the string down with my left hand. That way it stays nice and top. I want to get a nice tight wind and we want to bend the string across the tuner. That's what we call a notch in. Tighten it up and finally we're ready to cut off the excess and we're good to go. Alright everyone thank you so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video and had a change in acoustic guitar string. I have plenty more videos coming up so keep checking back and please subscribe. I'm Rob from Swift's Guitar Lessons at Philadelphia saying happy things.",non-well-being
" Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a Style Sheet language famous for making websites look pretty, by default a browser will render HTML as a boring black and white document. CSS allows you to describe the presentation of this markup by modifying the size, color, positioning, and layout of HTML elements. It was first released in 1996 and evolved into CSS3 by 1999. The language continues to evolve to this day with new features, but there will never be a CSS4, just updates to the existing language. The typical CSS rule starts with a selector that can be matched to an element in the HTML document. You then use braces to create a declaration block that contains properties that change the appearance of that element. This is known as a CSS rule, but the tricky thing is that Style Sheets Cascade, a Style Sheet, might contain multiple rules that apply to the same element. This creates a hierarchy, and rules that are more specific will overwrite the rules of their parents. In other words, the order of your CSS rules matter. In addition, some elements will inherit the styles of their parent, but others will not. Ultimately, the browser uses the concepts of Cascade, Specificity, and inheritance to control which styles are applied to an element. To get started, open up a Style tag and any HTML document. A selector can target all HTML elements of a certain type, multiple related elements with a custom class, or a single element with an ID. Now, think of every HTML element like a box. The content is in the middle, followed by padding, border, and a margin. The amount of real estate used by every area in the box can be customized by defining properties like padding and margin. They can take explicit pixel values, or responsive values that are relative to the parent element, or a percentage of the viewport itself. Now these boxes will bump into each other to make up a web page. But you can use tools like Flex Layout and Grid Layout to control how they flow together in a sophisticated way. It can also detect user interaction with pseudo-selectors like hover. CSS also makes it possible to add logic to your code with variables or custom properties, and by making media queries that can apply styles conditionally based on the size or type of device. And it can even handle complex animations with transitions and keyframes. This has been Cascading Style Sheets in 100 seconds.

" Hi there, I'm going to show you one of the most popular ways to tie a tie, using the Windsor knot. Also known as a double Windsor or a full Windsor. Start with your collar up in the tie around your neck. If you right-hand it on the wide end in your right hand and the narrow end in your left hand. Now it's important to remember that the longer you make the wide end, the lower the tie will hang when you finished. Basically you want to line up your tie like this. If you remember this you'll save yourself a lot of time later on. Now cross each end over, wide end over the top and leave about this much on the narrow end. That's about four inches or ten centimeters. With your left hand take the wide end, thread it through the back of this opening from behind. Thread it all the way through like this. Now take the wide end and with your left hand, wrap it all the way around the back like this. Switch hands. Notice here how the back of the tie is facing outward. Taking the wide end now in your right hand, thread it through the front of this opening, we're going through the front and down this time. Thread it through all the way down like this. Alright, hardest part's now done. The rest is easy. What you can see here is the inside of your knot. Should look a bit like a triangle. Put your left index finger on the knot like this and keep it there. With your other hand, wrap the wide end around the knot from right to left and then grab it from behind. Keep your index finger where it is. With your right hand, push the wide end through this opening again from the back. So we're coming up and through the back like this. Threading it through the hole. Alright, here comes the punch line. Your index finger has created a little tunnel. What you need to do now is thread the tie down through the tunnel and pull it down. The last step now is to adjust and tighten it. Alternating between the long end and the short end. Gradually pulling the knot up, shaping it as you go until it's just how you want it to be. A sharp, symmetrical, triangular knot. Pull your collar down and bingo! A full, winds of knot. Thank you for watching. I hope you found this helpful.",non-well-being
" With more than 2,800 products available, around 2.2 billion servings a day in more than 200 countries, in a market value of approximately $234 billion US dollars, Coca-Cola is the world's largest non-alcoholic beverage manufacturer and distributor. Included in 1886 by Dr. Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, and intended as a patent medicine, claiming to provide relief from various ailments Coca-Cola served only 9 drinks per day in its first year of production. Wow, talk about growth! Its two key ingredients were caffeine and cocaine, the letter being removed from the product for a cocaine-free variant in 1903. The name was born from these two items, the Coca-leaf and the Cola nut. It was thought that the repetition of the letter C would capture the consumer's attention, and they were right. Today Coca-Cola's logo and brand is the most recognizable in the world, beating the likes of Google, Nike, McDonald's, and Apple to the top spot. So, what has been the key to success for the carbonated soft drink over the last 137 years? First of all, the recipe or formula for the legendary product remains a closely guarded secret. In fact, a popular myth states that only two executives have access to the formula, with each executive possessing only half of the formula. This precious formula is actually written on paper, and is now secured in a vault at the world of Coca-Cola Museum in Atlanta. Many products have attempted to imitate the taste, but only Pepsi really ever came close. Created at around the same time in 1898, there is an ongoing battle amongst consumers about which drink tastes the best. In terms of sales and branding, Coca-Cola wins every time. In 2020, for example, the company sold around 418 billion liters, while Pepsi only sold 310 billion liters. Coca-Cola generates around 46% of its revenue from the US market, where Pepsi claims around 25%. According to a recent survey by Time magazine, soft drink sales in the US account for around 65 billion US dollars per year. Coca-Cola has long been applauded for its marketing and branding strategies over the years. The iconic polar bears and Santa Claus commercials, countless sport sponsorships from the Olympics and Paralympics to the FIFA World Cup, partnerships with charities from WWF to the American Red Cross. Famous slogans like Coke is it, and share a Coke and its collaborations with some of the world's biggest superstars from Marilyn Monroe to the Braun James. While Coca-Cola's flagship product remains the classic Coca-Cola soda, the brand has evolved to include many other noteworthy products. Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Sprite, Fanta, Powerade, Costa Coffee, Minute Made, and Shwebs to name a few. The company is also on a mission to do its part for the environment with sustainable packaging, the promotion of recycling and maximization of water conservation worldwide. Coca-Cola's rich history, unparalleled success, and warmth towards its consumers have affirmed its domination of the soft drinks industry today and for the foreseeable future. The ball is in your cord now Pepsi, Coca-Cola says it's your serve.",non-well-being
" So at some point in their lives, nearly everybody has wanted to dig a hole down to the center of the earth. The only problem is, nobody ever has actually dug a hole down that far. This leads us to the question that this video is all about. If humanity decided that digging a hole was the number one objective of our species, then how deep down could we actually dig with modern day technology? Let's say that we start somewhere on the earth's surface and just start digging from there. Too far down at 1.8 meters and we arrive at the standard grave depth in western culture, so if you are afraid of zombies, this is how far down they'll be coming from. Four meters down and we arrive at the depth that Faro Tutankhamens tomb was discovered at. A little further at 6 meters below the surface, we reach the maximum depth that metal detectors can pick up signals from. At 12 meters, we can find the deepest burrows dug by animals, the Nile crocodile. A little further down at 20 meters and we arrive at the depth of the Paris Catechomes beneath the city of Paris, a tomb that holds the remains of over 6 million people. Double that distance to 40 meters down and we can see the deepest swimming pool in the world. If you drained this pool and jumped into it from the top, it would take nearly 3 seconds before you would hit the bottom. 100 meters down is the usual distance that governments bury their nuclear waste at. To just beneath that, at 105.5 meters down is the deepest metro station in the world, located in Kiev. Moving on to 122 meters down and we see the deepest known point that a plant's roots have ever reached, a fig tree in South Africa. 220 meters down and we arrive at the deepest river in the world, the Congo River in Africa. Beyond that, at 240 meters, you can ride through the deepest railway tunnel in the world that connects the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido. And at 287 meters down, you can drive through the deepest road tunnel in the world in Norway. 305 meters down and you would still be vulnerable to the B82 Earth penetrating nuclear warhead, which can destroy structures up to this depth beneath the surface. Incredibly though, at 392 meters, we arrive at the deepest well and possibly deepest hole ever dug by hand. This is the Wooding Dean Waterwell in the UK and it was dug all the way back in 1862. At 603 meters down, we arrive at something terrifying, the deepest vertical drop inside of a cave. If you were unfortunate enough to be in this cave and fall down this hole, the fall would be higher up than falling from the top of the one world trade center in New York, and the fall would take you over 11 seconds before hitting the bottom. Even further down though at 700 meters is where the Chilean miners were trapped at for 69 days back in 2010. 170 meters down is the deepest hole ever dug that still has an open sky above it, the Bingham Canyon open pit mine in Utah. This pit is so deep that you could place the tallest building in the entire world in the center and still have over 100 more meters to the surface. Much further down at 1400-10 meters though is where the deepest concert ever held happened by the band Agonizer in Finland. 1642 meters down is the depth of the deepest lake on Earth, Lake Baikal in Russia, and 1857 meters down is the deepest part of the Grand Canyon. The deepest known cave on Earth is located 2,197 meters beneath the surface in Georgia, but the deepest hole that you could actually fall into goes way deeper than even this. All the way down at 3132 meters is the bottom of the Moab-Cott song Mind Shaft in South Africa. Taking the elevator takes 4 and a half minutes to reach the bottom, but if you fell into it from the top it would take you 25 seconds for you to hit the bottom and think about what you've just done. Long enough to receive and miss an entire phone call. Even further down at 3600 meters is the deepest point that a multicellular organism has been found alive. This freaky looking worm, but human beings themselves have been even deeper than this. 4,000 meters down is the deepest part of the deepest mine on Earth also located in South Africa. The trip from the surface down to the bottom takes over an hour to complete, and the temperature at the bottom can reach a sweltering 66 degrees Celsius. 6,000 meters is the average depth of the oceanic crust beneath the ocean floor. Way down at 8,848 meters is the height of Mount Everest if it were placed underground instead. 10,994 meters down is the bottom of the Marionus trench which is the deepest part of the ocean. I already covered the depth of the ocean in another video, but unbelievably humans have actually dug down significantly deeper than even this. For reference about what's next, 11,887 meters is the average altitude that a commercial airliner flies at. But deeper than that, at 12,262 meters is the depth of the Kola Superdeep borehole, a project where the Soviet Union attempted to drill all the way through the Earth's crust. They only reached a third of the way there, though, because the temperature at this depth reached 180 degrees Celsius, which was too hot for the drill to continue operating any further. The hole is also only 23 centimeters wide, so luckily you can't accidentally fall into it. If you dropped a quarter down the shaft though, it would take about 50 seconds before it hit the bottom. Recently however, this depth has been surpassed by the Z44 Shavyo oil and gas well, which has drilled down to a depth of 12,376 meters. That's the equivalent of stacking 15 birch caliphas on top of each other, and currently represents the deepest hole that humanity has ever dug. The crust however can extend down to 70,000 meters below the Earth's surface, and the planet's center is located 6,371 kilometers down. If the surface of the Earth is Lisbon Portugal, and the planet's center is Estona Kazakhstan, then humanity so far has just ventured this tiny, insignificant distance.

It boasts an extensive network of bike paths and approximately 27% of all trips in the country are made by bicycle. Tulip Mania The Netherlands is renowned for its tulips. However, did you know that during the 17th century tulip bulbs were so highly valued that they sparked an economic frenzy known as tulip Mania? At the peak of the craze a single tulip bulb could cost as much as a grand house. Dutch Cheese Delights The Netherlands is a cheese lover's dream. Gouda and Adam are the most famous varieties. But the country boasts over 1,000 different types of Dutch cheese. Be sure to try a cheese tasting or visit the traditional cheese markets in cities like Alkamaar or Gouda.

The Delta Works, a massive system of dams, storm surge barriers and dikes protects the low-lying country from the North Sea. It's a marvel of Dutch engineering and even considered one of the seven wonders of the modern world. Dutch Pancakes Indulge and some delicious Dutch pancakes known as Panoncoken. These pancakes are larger and thinner than the American variety and can be enjoyed with both sweet and savory toppings. Be sure to try the traditional Struppwafel, a delightful treat made of two thin waffles filled with caramel syrup.

Earth is a complicated place. There are a lot of us that share this planet together, and it's sometimes difficult to understand who everybody is and what everybody believes. To understand things a little better, let's shrink the entire world population down from 7.5 billion people all the way down to just 100 people and keep our small 100% society as similar to the real world as possible. Dividing between gender, the 100% world would be equally divided between 50 men and 50 women. Most of these people would live in Asia, a total of 59 people compared to 16 people living in Africa, 10 living in Europe, 8 in North America, only 6 in South America and just one lonely person living in Australia and Oceania. 11 of these people would be Chinese citizens and another 18 would be Indians. There would be only 4 Americans, 3 Brazilians, 2 Russians and 1 German. The other 53 people would be citizens of 187 other countries around the world. Most of these people would be pretty young, with 9 people aged just between 0 and 4 years old. 17 people would be aged between 5 and 14 years old, and 16 people would be aged between 15 and 24 years old. Another 16 people would be aged between 25 and 34, which means that 58 total people are younger than 35 years old. 20 people would be between 35 and 49, just 14 people would be aged 50 to 64, and only 8 people would be above the age of 65. When we talk about religion in the group of 100, 31 people would adhere to Christianity. 23 would be Muslims. 15 would be Hindus. 7 would be Buddhists. 9 would follow other religions, and 15 people would be non-religious or atheists. Mandarin Chinese is the most understood language with 14 people understanding it, but English isn't far behind it with 13 people understanding it. 9 people understand Hindustani. 8 people understand Spanish, and 5 people understand Arabic, with the other 51 people speaking over 7,000 other languages. Luckily everybody can read and write, with 86 people possessing this ability, but there are still 14 people who are illiterate. 92 people have access to clean and safe drinking water, but 8 people do not, and struggle as a result. 62 people are healthy in their weight, but 11 people are malnourished, and 1 person is literally starving. The other 26 people are overweight, and 8 of those people are actually obese. Only 1 people do not have adequate housing to fully protect themselves from the elements, and 1 person is homeless. The other 78 people however do have proper housing for themselves. Only 60 people have access to toilets though, and the other 40 people do not. Of those 40 people, 15 of them still defecate out in the open outdoors. 54 people live in cities, while the other 46 people live out in the countryside. 99 people are currently unemployed, while the other 91 people either are employed or are outside of the labor force. One of these people has AIDS, and 5 people will be infected by some form of STD this year alone. 58 people are currently married, and the average age that people get married at is 29 for women and 32 for men. Another 15 people actively smoke tobacco products, while the other 85 people do not. Interestingly enough, the same statistic is true of vehicle ownership, with 15 people owning a motor vehicle and another 85 people not owning one. Most people are overwhelmingly right-handed, with only 10 people being left-handed. 73 people have or are expected to graduate from high school, while the other 27 people haven't or are not expected to graduate. However, only 7 people hold a college degree of any kind, while the other 93 people do not. It doesn't stop most people from owning a cell phone. 80 people are in possession of one, while the other 20 people do not have one. This means that yes, more people have access to a cell phone in the world than a toilet. Internet access is also much more uncommon than cell phone ownership, with only 42 people having access to it and the other 58 people not having any access to it. Speaking of the people with internet access however, 26 of them have a Facebook profile, and 14 of them have a YouTube account, and 4 of them use Twitter at least once per month. But perhaps the most shocking difference in our small group of 100 people is the distribution of wealth between them. 71 people have a net worth of under $10,000, and out of them 12 people are living on less than $2 per day. 21 people have a net worth between $10,000 and $100,000, and 7 people have a net worth between $100,000 and $1 million. There is only one person who actually has a net worth above $1 million, but this one person is vastly more wealthy than even this chart makes it appear. This one person owns 50% of all the money in the world. The next 9 people own 35% of all the money in the world, so to recap, 10 people together control 85% of all the money in the society. Other 20 people owns 12% of the global money supply, which means that 70 people, the vast majority of the society, only controls a mere 3% of the money supply. In addition, one person is a refugee or currently displaced from their home, and two people are named Muhammad, which is the most common name in the world currently. Finally, all 100 people currently live on Earth, our home. Within a few years however, who knows how all of this data may be different. So this video was made possible by Hover. I actually just recently bought two new domains with Hover, whataworld.fm for my super secret upcoming podcast series with fellow YouTuber second thought, and real life lore.net so I can finally have my own website. What's great about both of them is how easy it was to find them and connect both of them to a hosting provider through Hover. The entire process of finding and buying both domains and connecting them to a provider took under a minute to actually do. If you're looking to build your presence on the internet, having your own site is incredibly important and the ending extension can truly set you apart. Hover has over 400 different extensions like .fm, .net, or even .ninja, or .lol.

"Hey guys, it's me Cap, formerly Coach of TSM and Wisp. I wanted to make a video about something that really pisses me off and I see all the time. The main examples in this video are from the Orisa-Juno-Brig comp that was popular in Stage 4 and Stage 2 for Korea, but this applies to almost every Overwatch 2 comp, except for a few specific cases. It's about ""getting off the f***ing corner."" What does this mean? It refers to how teams approach turning corners, typically putting their tank at the front with the backline following, which often leaves the backline vulnerable when facing good teams. The enemy tank holds the corner while their backline plays off it, making their backline harder to reach and leading to a trade-off situation that heavily favors them. This mismatch can cause teams to lose fights. Overwatch 2's gameplay boils down to interactions between tanks and backlines, with neutral fights about setup and mid-fights about execution. Whether you're defending or attacking, the key is to position your backline off the corner to avoid being easily punished. For defenders, tanks can hold the corner while backliners maintain sightlines but stay at a safe distance. Attackers need to swing effectively, recognizing when to punish tanks or backliners, while avoiding positions where they can be easily traded. Teams must manage cooldowns and ultimates to bait and punish overextensions, emphasizing positioning and timing over brute aggression. Poor execution, like exposing your backline on the corner, leads to predictable losses. Watching gameplay from the enemy tank's perspective can reveal flaws in positioning. Ultimately, Overwatch 2 requires nuanced decisions about when to engage, bait, or swing around corners effectively, making every fight a test of strategy and execution.",non-well-being
oh [Music] there's an old legend in the Hindu and Buddhist tradition of a kingdom called Shambhala a realm of peace and Purity inhabited only by the enlightened westerners May recognize it better as Shangri-La after the fictional Tibetan Utopia in Lost Horizon James Hilton's best-selling novel from 1933 even if you're unfamiliar with the book or Frank capper's film inspired by the book the idea of Shangri-La as the kind of far-flung paradise has been prevalent in modern pop culture ever since [Music] many Tibetan llamas or spiritual leaders have described Shambhala as an inner tantric state is a saskat world the meaning is the source of happiness so that means every single individual need that While others have maintained that it has a physical presence on earth a Promised Land hidden in the Himalayas paintings are Nicholas rohrich's visions of Shambhala which the remarkable Russian artist scholar Mystic and Explorer went to Great Lengths and icy Heights to find [Music] in the 1920s rohrich and his wife Helena led a mysterious albeit lionhearted expedition across 8 000 miles of forbidding terrain their purpose was to document the rituals monuments and landslaves of Asia's remote reaches or so they said the secret motivation behind the pilgrimage was to locate Shambala Roark believed that its Discovery would awaken the Buddha of the future who would guide the world through a purifying apocalypse and into a Halcyon age of Perfect Harmony rohrich's urge to find truth in folklore made his story as Mythic as the Legends he chased the Nicholas rohrich museum is as wonderfully curious as its namesake The Life and Legacy of this eccentric Russian artist who sought to unearth a Divine Tibetan Kingdom among a dizzying number of other endeavors is preserved in a Manhattan townhouse on the upper west side and most locals whom I've spoken to had no idea that this well-hidden gem exists a Shambhala of its own right tucked away on 107th Street [Music] why the Nicholas rohrich museum is here has to do with the end of his story which begins in the Russian city of Saint Petersburg in 1874. [Music] Boston [Applause] [Music] somebody [Music] it was an exciting time to come into the world the Russian composer Madison completed his Masterpiece the Opera Boris thought enough the Russian author Leo Tolstoy was writing Anna Karenina into existence the first impressionist exhibition in Paris fundamentally altered the trajectory of Modern Art to be the son of monied parents meant exposure to all this greatness and rohrik grew up surrounded by interesting people and beautiful things Summers were spent at his family's 4 000 acre country estate previously owned by a Russian count who had traveled to India when he returned he named the estate ishvara a Sanskrit term meaning Lord or Supreme Being inside the house a naturally inquisitive rohrich filled his head with accounts of unwavering Saints and Valiant knights in the library and in the living room he'd admire a painting of a Sublime Himalayan peak which he would travel thousands of miles to behold later in life outside ancient Woodlands revealed ancestral relics and he delighted in his own mini archaeological digs [Music] saying that he didn't formally pursue archeology but then again painting was the way for him to imaginatively interpret Tales of God's healers and talismans and it's in that nebulous space between history and myth that he was really in his element he was almost dissuaded from pursuing art as well it was just assumed that he would go into law as his father did but like a character in The Legends he adored it was a destiny had its own plan for rohrich foreign [Music] he struck a deal with his father he would go to law school if he could also study art in St Petersburg it was the 1890s and the city was buzzing with new Notions of modernism all across Europe the conventions of academic art were getting the boot in favor of the avant-garde it was at law school but row it crossed paths with Sergey diagolev who had his finger on the pulse he also had a sensibility for uniting the Visual and Performing Arts and he would go on to commission some of the most celebrated works of art as the founder of the famous ballet ruse rhetoric designed the fabulous set pieces for various Productions and what I never knew is that he both designed and co-developed The Rite of Spring which is almost exclusively credited to Igor Stravinsky and considered one of the first and most radical works of modernism so radical that when the ballet debuted in 1913 it supposedly reduced a glamorous Parisian audience to screaming heckling violent animals various accounts of its now legendary opening night report objects being catapulted at the dancers on stage people stripping naked in protest and at least one official challenge to a duel Stravinsky was just beside himself as he processed the brutal criticism of what eventually became revered as his magnum opus decades later when Disney produced an animated sequence to The Rite of Spring in Fantasia the composer brutally denounced the film as a quote imbecility of course Fantasia helped make the piece even more iconic despite their successful collaboration Stravinsky saw something suspicious in rohrich he once said that the artist quote looked as though he ought to have been a Mystic or a spy granted things had soured between the two men who bickered over who really deserved top billing for The Rite of Spring but Stravinsky's read wasn't far off together with his wife Helena roric devoured religious doctrines including those belonging to theosophy a kind of proto-new Age movement spiritual openness was all the rage at the time and plenty of artists dabbled in the occult from odion Verdon to Pete Mondrian after that the influence of contemporary Russian symbolism which encouraged investigation of the mystical in Russian literature and art Works were becoming intensely devoured eventually he came to believe that he was The Reincarnation of the fifth Dalai Lama so who better to search for Shambhala and Ernest and Usher in the end of days in roark's defense political tension in Europe was reaching a fever pitch and when World War one broke out in 1914 he felt like he had prophetically sensed its arrival then came the Russian Revolution in 1917 which ended the Romanov Dynasty and marked the beginning of Soviet Russia the Rolex had already left for Finland where Nicholas was recovering from a bout of illness but little did they know when they left St Petersburg that the Border would close and they would never return essentially refugees at this point the family traveled West to Sweden then England then to the U.S in 1920 with an station from the Chicago Art Institute Roark painted out west in New Mexico and back east in Maine and settled for a time in New York City the remarkably warm reception of his art and ideas in America made the execution of his so-called great plan feel more imminent than ever finally in 1923 the rubrics arrived in India and prepared for their Journey which would take them to Chinese turkistan the Siberian Republic of altai Mongolia and Tibet uh ultimately Rorick never did find Shambhala but he did achieve Monumental things in addition to the 7 000 odd paintings he made during his lifetime [Music] [Music] thank you among his most noble contributions is what's known as The rohrich Pact a treaty for the preservation of precious Heritage sites during times of conflict in 1935 The Pact was signed into law by the United States and 21 other nations his f one had multiple nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize and praise for major figures such as Albert Einstein a self-proclaimed militant pacifist who considered rohrich a genius company in The Pact is rohrich's Banner of peace Peach Bears three dots enveloped by a circle a lesson artifacts across cultures and eras some interpret it as the Eternal circle of culture enveloping arts science and religion others as the past present and future of humanity secured within the circle of Eternity [Music] so we come full circle to the origins of this Museum which likewise vows to preserve and protect rohrich's Legacy back in New York the Rolex had established both the Roark Museum and master Institute of United Arts an educational Institution for music art design Linguistics journalism dance the things that make us cultural creatures the master Institute attracted a number of notable artists including George Bellows Rockwell Kant and isamu nuguchi but funding was cut when the Great Depression hit and both the Institute and the original Museum closed in the 30s by this time rorig and his family had settled in India's Kulu Valley in the Himalayan Foothills where he died in 1947 at the age of 73 but his Endeavors didn't die with him in 1949 one of the master institute's founding members led the establishment of the Nicholas rohrich Museum here today the museum is home to one of the most comprehensive collections of Nicholas rohrich's work with over 200 paintings in its possession and is open to the public free of charge I grew up in this neighborhood so it's always a treat to be back and speaking of trees it just so happens that one of the Upper West side's best basal joints is just a block away from the museum absolute Bagels is a long-standing local favorite the owner moved here in the 80s from his native Thailand and his first New York Bagel was a revelation he apprenticed at various bagel shops around the city before he established his own in 1990. the Upper West Side is largely residential but there's a lot of iconic stuff up here on 112th and Broadway you've got Toms

further Ado let's Dive In first of all we have lying now Buddha said stay away from lying now I know we all have said white lies here and there in all of our lives right but whether it is a white lie whether it is a black light gray light or a red lie no matter what the LIE is lying itself can be so harmful for all of our lives why is that when you lie it destroys your trust when you lie it destroys your character right so that is why it is very important to have trust between people in our daily relationships between people the most important component of a happy relationship is the trust so that is why Buddha said live a truthful life and it is very important to have that transparency and honesty in our relationships so the first thing that we have to stay away from is lie and next we have divisive speech what do you mean by divisive speech divisive speech is all about creating drama between people or creating conflicts between people using your words right it can be gossiping or it can be talking behind someone's back right I might say that when you talk these words or when you use this divisive speech it is not a good thing for your life and and also it is not a good thing for other people's relationships so Buddha said do not use this divisive speech do not break the relationships between people using your words most of the time we use the divisive speech out of jealousy or out of anger so that is why it's very important to stay away from divisive speech and the third one is Buddha said stay away from harsh speech now when someone is calling you or when when someone is treating you with rude words how do you feel now we all have been in this receiving end of such speeches now how did you feel we felt sad we felt depressed we felt down about ourselves so that is why Buddha said do not use your words to put someone down right do not use your words out of anger this is all about criticizing and name calling and putting someone else down with your words right so Buddha said stay away from harsh speech and finally Buddha said stay away from idle chatter what do you mean by idle chatter idle chatter is all about speaking meaningless or useless things right now that doesn't say that we cannot have a small chat or a fun talk with people you can you we can do that but we have to know where our limit is in our speech right we have to set the boundaries in our speech right we have to know where our speech become unproductive right when you use these words when you use your words in a meaningful way you can create a positive life and you can create a positive emotions or positive positive feelings in others lives too right so these are the four unwholesome speeches that we have to stay away from that our great teacher Supreme Buddha taught us according to the Buddha's teachings right so why all these things matter why these unwholesome speeches matter in our life well Buddha said the words that we speak can create either positive or negative karma in our life do not think lightly about this Karma right you have to be very careful about the karma so the intention behind your words really matters in your life and that is why we have to use our words wisely because it can make a huge impact in our lives as well as in others lives too so words that we speak are like a knife right you can use the knife to cut something useful right and also you can use the knife to kill someone else so let's use our words to create a better life for ourselves and for others so thank you for tuning in I hope you got some food for thought for your life so until next time I wish you all may all of you be well and happy and may all of you live in peace forever ,non-well-being
" How to tie your shoes. There are a lot of different ways to tie your shoes. We'll show you the most common way. This will work for either your left or your right shoe. Start by grabbing one lace in each hand about halfway up the lace. Hold them so they make a V. Cross the laces to make an X. One lace will be in front and the other lace is behind it. Take the lace that is behind, pull it over the front and put it through the hole. Now take both ends and pull until the X becomes a V again. The harder you pull, the tighter your shoe gets. Let's spread the V out so we can see it now. Now take one lace at the halfway point and let it hang on your finger. Using your other hand, pinch both sides of the lace so it makes a loop around your finger. Now pull your finger out and you've got an open loop. Hold onto it. With your other hand, take the other lace and lay it over your thumb and finger so that it's in front of the loop. Now you have both laces pointing in the same direction. Use your finger to send that lace back to the other side and now the laces point opposite ways again. Only now you've made a little hole between your shoe and your thumb. See? A little hole. Here's the fun part. Poke the lace through the little hole just a little bit so it makes a loose loop. Now grab both loops at the same time and pull until the knot is tight. You've just tied your shoe. Review those steps a few times until you can remember how to do it. Once you know how to tie the knot, keep practicing. If you practice doing it many times, eventually you'll be able to do it without even looking. See if you can do it like this. That's pretty fast, huh?",non-well-being
" Now in this lesson we're going to solve quadratic equations by completing the square. So let's start with this one. x squared plus 4x is equal to 5. So to complete this square, take half of the number in front of x, which is 2, half a 4 is 2, and square it. So we're going to add 2 square to both sides. Whatever you do to left side, you must also do to the right side. Now to factor this expression, x squared plus 4x plus 4, it's going to be x, and then whatever this sign is, plus this number before you square it, x plus 2 squared. If you factor x squared plus 4x plus 4, it's x plus 2 times x plus 2. Two numbers that multiply to 4 and add to 4 is 2 and 2. On the right side, we have 5 plus 2 squared, which is 4, and 5 plus 4 is 9. So now let's solve for the variable x. Let's take the square root of both sides. The square root of x plus 2 squared is x plus 2, and the square root of 9 is plus or minus 3. So now we have two equations. x plus 2 is equal to 3, and x plus 2 is equal to negative 3. So if we subtract both sides by 2, we can see that x is equal to 1. That's one of the answers. And for the other one, if we subtract both sides by 2, negative 3 minus 2 is negative 5. So x is equal to negative 5. Now let's work on another example. Try this one. 2x squared minus 12x. Minus 7 equals 0. Solved by completing the square. So first, I'm going to move the negative 7 to the right side. So 2x squared minus 12x is equal to positive 7. Now notice that there's a 2 in front of x squared. What we need to do is factor off the 2. If we take out 2, it's going to be x squared minus 6x, and then I'm going to leave a space. Now let's complete the square. Half of 6 is 3. And we need to square it. So I've added not just 9 to the left side, but 9 times 2, which is 18. Now whatever you do to the left side, you must also do to the right side. So I have to add positive 18 to the right side. Now to factor, x squared minus 6x plus 3 squared. It's going to be x. Whatever this symbol is minus, this number squared. x squared minus 6x plus 9 is x minus 3 times x minus 3. And then 7 plus 18, that's 25. Now let's divide by 2. So x minus 3 squared is equal to 25 divided by 2. Now we can take the square root of both sides. So on the left, it's just going to be x minus 3. On the right, plus or minus, the square root of 25 is 5. The square root of 2, we'll just leave it as root 2. Now let's rationalize this expression. Let's multiply the top and the bottom by root 2. So x minus 3 is equal to plus or minus 5 root 2 over 2. Now all we can do now is just add 3 to both sides. So x is equal to 3 plus or minus 5 root 2 over 2. Now we can't add 3 and 5 root 2 over 2. We can't add them together. So we're just going to leave it like this. This is the answer. Now keep in mind there's 2 answers. First answer is 3 plus 5 root 2 over 2. And the second answer is 3 minus 5 root 2 over 2. Now let's try another example. 3x squared minus 5x is equal to 10. Solve by completing the square. Now the first thing we're going to do is take out a 3 from the first two terms. 3x squared divided by 3 is x squared. Negative 5x divided by 3. Well it's just going to be negative 5 over 3x. Now we need to take half of this number. Half of 5 over 3 is basically 5 over 6. Multiply it did an omitted by 2. That's how you can find a half of a fraction. And then once we take half of it we need to square it. So it's going to be 5 over 6 squared. Now on the left side we've added 5 over 6 squared but time-stream. So we got to add that to the right side as well. Now how can we factor this expression? Everything you need you can see it. It's going to be x and then whatever this sign is minus. This number before you square it 5 over 6 squared. It's always going to work out that way. On the right we have a 10 plus 3. 5 squared is 25. 6 squared is 36. Now let's combine this first. 3 over 36. If we divide 36 by 3 we're going to get 12. So this is the same as 25 over 12. Plus 10 over 1. Now let's combine 10 over 1 and 25 over 12. To do that we need to get common denominators. Let's multiply this by 12 over 12. So that becomes 120 over 12. 120 plus 25 is 145 over 12. Now what we need to do is get rid of this tree. So we're going to multiply both sides by 1 third. On the left side 3 and 1 third will cancel. On the right side we might be able to reduce a few things. Well it turns out that 145 is knocked invisible by 3. So we can't reduce that. So let's multiply 12 times 3 which is 36. Now let's take the square root of both sides. We can't really simplify the square root of 145. So we just have to leave it the way it is. But the square root of 36 is 6. And this is going to be plus or minus. All we can do is now add this fraction to this side. So the final answer, x is equal to 5 over 6 plus or minus root 145. That's a terrible 5. The divided by 6. So this is the answer. If you want you can write it like this too as a single fraction. Since we have the same denominator. 5 plus or minus root 145 over 6. You can leave it like that if you want to.",non-well-being
" So, today we will find out about the chi-square test and how it is used to find out whether two variables, two given variables are related or not. Now, first of all we need to find out what is our aim, why are we using the test. So, that can be stated like this. Suppose, this particular question, you can look at this table. In this table we have two variables. One represents the education qualification of a person and the other represents the marital status of a person whether he is unmarried, married, divorced or widowed. Now, what are aim is our aim is to calculate or state whether the two variables, the education qualification and the marital status are these related to each other or they have no relation with each other. One of the other thing. So, first of all we start with defining our null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis. Our null hypothesis can be stated that there is no correlation between the two variables and the alternate hypothesis can be stated by saying that there is significant relation between the two variables. Now, significant, the significance level is to be defined. The significant level either it can be taken as 0.05 which is 5 percent deviation from bean or we can say 0.01. Usually, the significance level is taken as 0.05. There are different significance levels taken for different type of observations. But generally, the significance level is taken as 5 percent that is 0.05. So, we will go with that. Now, how to start? Now, first of all we will look at the observation values, the values which are observed or which have been taken from the field. So, these are called as observed values. Now, we prepare another table for the same variables, but those values will be calculated values or you can see the expected values. Now, how to calculate it? Now, in this table, you can see there are 36 people who are unmarried and whose education is high school. Now, for those people, the expected value could be the row total into the column total divided by the grand total. There are 300 people whose data is been collected. So, that is called as the grand total. So, that comes out to be 27. In the same way, for the first element that is 18, there are 18 people who are unmarried and whose education is middle school. The expected value will be 90 into 39 divided by 300. That will give you 11.7. In the same way, we need to calculate the expected value for all the categories and the table which will get like this. This will be the table for the expected values and the first one was the table for the observed values. Now, our aim is to find out how much deviation is there between the two given values. That is found out by a simple formula that is observed minus the expected value, the whole square upon the expected value. So, we prepare another table which states the difference between the two variables, which states the difference between the two values. Now, we will look at this table now. Here you can see the table contains different values. The table contains the observed value, the expected value, the difference between the two values, the square of the difference between the two values and divided by the expected value. So, we will fill out this table. The first value there was 18 and the observed value was 18. The expected values 11.7. So, 18, 11.7, the difference, the square and we divided by the expected value that is 11.7, what I get is 639.69 and once I divided by E, I get 3, I get as 3.39. Now, in the same way, we need to calculate all the given values, the difference between the expected and the observed values and I get this table completed. And once I complete this table, you can see the total of this last column that is the observed value minus the expected value, the whole square upon the expected value. This value is called as the value of the chi square. Now, this value is the calculated chi square. We also need to compare this value with the tabular value of chi square. Now, how is that calculated? Now, for tabular value, I need to find out the degrees of freedom. Now, degrees of freedom is found out by a simple way. You can see in the original question, there were five columns, five different categories for the level of education and there were four different categories for the medical status. So, the degrees of freedom is calculated by 5 minus 1 into 4 minus 1 that comes out to be 12. So, 12, we need to see the table for the, we need to see this table for the tabular value of chi square and we can see the tabular value of chi square for the degrees of freedom that is 12 and the significance level 0.05 that comes out to be 21.03. Now, once you get this value, we can compare the calculated value and the observed value. We can see the tabular value is smaller than the calculated value. So, in chi square whenever the calculated value is greater than the tabular value or the critical value, then we can state that our null hypothesis is rejected and the alternate hypothesis is accepted. Now, what was our alternate hypothesis? It was that there is a significance relation between the two variables, between the marital status and the level of education. So, this is how we use the chi square test to state whether the two variables are related or not. So, we can see the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the value of chi square and the",non-well-being
"In the golden age of classical Athens, the average citizen had exactly two fears: the war with Sparta, and talking with Socrates. The Spartans at least were outside the city walls, but that wily Socrates was even more terrifying because he could be anywhere. You might be at a party for elite Athenians, walking through the Agora marketplace, or even waiting in line to be put on trial, but as soon as you smelled Socrates coming you knew you were in trouble. Then once he stepped barefoot into your line of sight and heard you so much as thinking, this disheveled goblin of a man would delight in dissecting every aspect of your conscience, question by question. Why do you hold your opinions, are you doing enough to be a good person, are you qualified to know what Goodness even means? In the eyes of the Athenian public, Socrates was a vulture scavenging the city for errant ideas, ready to dive on any offhand comments or boasts of wisdom. Socrates was, by all accounts, profoundly irritating to political bigwigs and self-proclaimed “experts”, but he was undeniably an upright citizen, having served in the Athenian army on three occasions and holding a deep respect for the laws of the city, and the boisterous Athenian youths absolutely loved the guy. Among that bunch, none was more devoted than his student Plato. Born to an aristocratic family in the mid 420s BC, Plato grew up among the leading political elite during the height of the Peloponnesian War, whereupon he bravely ditched any chance of a career in business or politics to instead study Philosophy. My hero. Around 387 BC, Plato founded an informal academy on his family estate where Athenians could freely gather to discuss and debate topics from the most ethical and practical to the abstract and theoretical. Plato’s Academy inspired other philosophical schools across Greece, such as the Lykeion of his student Aristotle, and it remained in use until its untimely destruction in the 80s BC – Long story, blame the Romans. Yet, like many a frustrated Athenian citizen, Plato could never escape Socrates, and Plato’s greatest philosophical legacy lies in his Socratic Dialogues, a collection of 30-odd philosophical discussions featuring his beloved mentor. These are not the first written works of philosophy, nor the first to ask big questions about the nature of the world and our place in it – but Plato’s approach is so thoroughly systematic and wide-ranging in its treatment of ethics, politics, epistemology, and abstract concepts that we can rightly credit Plato with creating The analytical toolkit of Western Philosophy, elevating it from a field of casual inquiry to a defined system of investigation. In short, the man is good, but more than anything else, it’s the dynamic between Socrates and Plato which makes these dialogues so darn captivating. To see how, as kánoume philosophía! Now, Plato had studied with Socrates for at least a decade before striking out on his own, and the instigating factor was Socrates dying. Because being a compulsive conversationalist wasn’t a crime in ancient Athens, and neither was being annoying, but Socrates was such a profound pain in the ass that three Athenians brought him up on charges of impiety and corrupting the youth in the hopes of getting him exiled or killed. And Socrates was so stubborn it worked perfectly! They held a trial, he told them to piss off, they sentenced him to death, he drank the poison, and simple as that, he’s on a boat to the river Styx! And after that rather traumatic experience, Plato’s outlet for grief and at least a little rage was writing, codifying the memory of his mentor through the activity he’d loved most, dialogue. At the time (and basically ever since), Philosophy was usually written as a treatise, where the author talks at you, but Plato instead adapted Athens’ local style of theatrical drama. The dialogue format was certainly new and unique, but it’s really a philosophy play, so it made perfect sense as a distinctly Athenian mode of philosophy, as well as a Socratic one. It also helps solve the issue of Socrates’ complete disdain for writing. He loved to talk, but thought that an idea dies as soon as it hits the papyrus. Writing is static, it can’t converse, it can’t react – but usefully: it also can’t drink poison, so Plato was willing to do it anyway. And by writing dialogues instead of treatises, Plato upheld the Socratic ideal of lively debate, and, in some cases, preserved actual discussions Socrates likely had. Among the earliest and most famous of Plato’s dialogues are the Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito, which depict the trial and imprisonment of Socrates, leading to his death in the latter Phaedo dialogue. These are a small slice of Plato’s total work, but they offer the most dramatic portrayal of Socrates’ character, and combine into the foundational narrative that all the other dialogues build on. So, what does Plato show us? The first dialogue in the series sees Socrates awaiting his trial outside the law court, where he meets a man named Euthyphro who’s prosecuting his own father for killing a murderer; he knows this is bold of him, but he considers it the pious thing to do. So Socrates asks “what is piety really?” and Euthyphro offers some ideas, but Socrates keeps finding problems, so they end up going in a circle without landing on a solid answer. Critically, Socrates isn’t being a mean-spirited contrarian, but genuinely wants to find an answer and is willing to defy conventional ideas to get at deeper truths. But the dialogue also asks how Athenians have any right to accuse Socrates of impiety when they themselves can’t even define it. This leads right into the Apology, which is not apologetic in the slightest but rather comes from the Greek word for Speaking in Defense. Here we listen to Socrates’ arguments for his innocence against the crimes of impiety and corrupting the youth, as well as a general defense for his philosophical questioning that the Athenians are actually upset about. He compares himself to a gadfly biting a lazy horse: an annoying presence that’s necessary to stimulate the Athenians to be better, and declares that even if acquitted he’ll never stop asking questions of people because the unexamined life is not worth living (38a5–6). After his defense, the 501-man jury finds him guilty, and this triggers a fascinating step in the Athenian legal process. After a guilty verdict, the prosecution and the defense each propose a punishment, and the jury votes once again. This encourages moderation, so when the prosecution proposed death, the assumption was Socrates would request exile and most likely get it, but instead he doubled down, saying if you want to know what I Deserve, I’ll tell you what I deserve. Put me up in the Prytaneion and give me free meals for life, because I’m doing Athens a service and that’s what I deserve… Naturally, the jury voted for death, but Socrates remained undaunted. The beauty of the language in the Apology is Plato’s gift, but that unshakable moral core was all Socrates – And that attitude pervades the next two dialogues. Now, the day before Socrates’ trial, a ship left port for a sacred festival on the island of Delos, and until it came back no executions were allowed to take place, so Socrates stayed in prison for a month, until his friend Crito arrives to tell him the ship was spotted off the coast of Sounion and would be back in the city soon after. Crito offers Socrates one last chance to escape but Socrates refuses on principle. Sure, the guards couldn’t care less if he bolted so long as he just left the city, but justice is justice and Socrates would rather die. In the next dialogue, he sure as hell does. The Phaedo portrays the last conversation with his students about the immortality of the soul before the sun sets and he drinks the poison Hemlock. The death is immaculately dramatized, as his friends swing between laughing and weeping while Socrates remains calm, serene, and pious to the very end. This is the stuff religions are made of, but Plato leverages the drama of it all to better explore those topics of piety, justice, and death his characters investigate. Now, we have an interesting problem here, because Socrates is all aboard the immortal soul train in the Phaedo, but earlier in the Apology he explicitly does not know what happens to him after he dies. And that gets to The Big Question in Platonic philosophy: Where does the historical Socrates end and Plato’s character of Socrates begin? The simplest answer is chronological, as Plato’s early dialogues hew much closer to how other sources paint the historical Socrates and have more basis in actual conversations – while the later dialogues see Plato get more inventive, developing Socrates into a character that he can drop in any story and set loose. Early dialogues often have plausible context or full historical precedent like the trial, but middle dialogues like the Republic create whole scenarios and characters for Socrates to bounce off of. We can also distinguish the dialogues by what Socrates is doing in them. The early dialogues typically follow a format of some smartypants declaring that they know something about politics, religion, ethics or the like, whereupon Socrates exercises carte blanche to ruin this person’s whole career, systematically skewering their positions and leaving them as a confused blubbering mess before carrying happily along with his day. This is the Socrates who Athens wanted dead. However, the middle and late dialogues show Socrates offering ideas for a change, possibly in line with Plato developing his ideas and delicately weaving them into the texts. Socrates in the latter dialogues takes a more rigorously mathematical approach and has more interest in abstract concepts. He still operates through lines of questioning, but we can clearly see Plato’s hand in this version of the character. Looking at the structure of the Republic, book 1 reads as a standard early dialogue, investigating the question of justice and ending with no clear answer, but in book 2 Socrates puts forward his own definition, using the metaphor of a city’s government to illustrate how justice works in a single person, and this discussion drives the subsequent nine books of the Republic. After several tangents and extra philosophical scaffolding to support the main argument, the metaphor falls apart, but several key ideas make it through intact – most significant being the theory of Forms, the intangible ideals and concepts that govern the universe. These forms are reflected down into mathematics, the physical world, and then images. So this drawing of Blue is an image of me, who is an image of humanity, which is itself an image of the concept of Life. This is where we glimpse Plato’s own philosophy; he never states it outright, because he also believes that philosophy is a process rather than a singular truth, but he gives Socrates more and more ideas that survive scrutiny and convince other characters in the dialogues. Those ideas, taken on their own, form an entire corpus of thought that’s gone on to inspire secular philosophy and Abrahamic theology for millennia. That all is plenty impressive, but it’s not why Plato is the best philosopher. See, the dialogue format isn’t just a cute recreation of Socrates’ antics or a clever riff on Athenian theater, it’s the only way to convey philosophy that meets the Socratic ideal. Plato recognized that text becomes fixed and static once it’s written, so his strategy is to make the reader participate with him and Socrates and the other characters. When the Euthyphro ends without an answer on what piety is, that invites the reader to use what they’ve learned and try their own hand at it – so that dialogue continues in our minds, millennia after Plato took his hand off the papyrus. The dialogues leave open questions, so as long as the text is read, the conversation remains alive as we craft our own answers. With the possible exception of Jewish philosophy in the Midrashic tradition, which is a beautiful communal exploration of the Torah unfolding over generations, almost no other western philosopher does this! Plato’s distinctly Athenian innovation is the best mode to convey philosophy, and I’m baffled that this isn’t the main way we do this! The craft of discussion and the process of investigating our ideas through questions gets us a greater understanding of real-world and theoretical truths. If we read a regular old treatise and just take an author’s word for it, we’re only coming at the idea from one angle, which then leaves some rhetorical flank exposed for someone like Socrates to rip it apart, but when we use the Socratic method to challenge our ideas, reconfigure and strengthen them, that’s when we approach real wisdom. Now go read a dialogue and start asking some questions! Thank you so much for watching! I first thought of doing this video last summer when I was re-reading the Euthyphro and thought “wait, this is, like, really really good???” There are plenty of other Platonic gems I didn’t get to cover, like the Protagoras and the Gorgias, but maybe that just means you should go read them for yourself and see what I’m on about. Oh no, what a shame, you just HAVE to go read Plato now, agh, damn, sorry, [laughing] –  anyway I’ll see you in the next one.",non-well-being
[Music] I want to talk just briefly about this third eye center business because it turns out to be pretty interesting the third eye is actually a name that's been given to another neural structure um or I should say structure because it's not strictly neural and that's the pineal gland this has an interesting history I promise I'm not taking off on a tangent here that isn't relevant to meditation so you have a brain of course and on both sides of your brain you tend to have mirror symmetric representations of the same things what do I mean by that well you have a prefrontal cortex on the right you have a prefrontal cortex on the left and they actually do slightly different things language is sometimes lateralized to one side but in general for every structure that you have on one side of the brain you have the same structure on the opposite side of the brain there's one clear exception to that and that's the pineal gland the pineal gland is the gland that makes melatonin which at night when it gets dark secretes melatonin and that melatonin makes you sleepy it helps you fall asleep but not stay asleep Descartes right the philosopher Descartes asserted that the pineal was the seat of the Soul because it was the one structure in the brain that he saw was not on both sides of the brain it was only one of them and in the middle now I don't know if it's the seed of the Soul or not I'm not in a position to make assessments like that but what do we know about the pineal the pineal as I mentioned is involved in releasing melatonin it does a few other things as well but it is also considered the third eye for a couple of reasons one is that it responds to light although in humans not directly so in birds and lizards and snakes they actually either have a thin skull or believe it or not two holes in the top of their skull that allow light to go directly in if you look at the head of a snake light can go directly into their brain through these holes and activate the pineal to suppress melatonin and control their wakefulness sleep rhythms in Birds they don't have holes in their skull but they have very thin skulls and believe it or not light can penetrate the thinness of those of the skull and many birds and communicates information about time of day and even time of year and that's translating to hormonal signals such as melatonin release from the pineal and so the pineal has been called the third eye because it's a light sensitive organ inside the brain in humans the pineal sits deep deep to the surface and light cannot get in there in fact if light can get into your brain unless you are part of a specific experiment where that's the intention or you're having neurosurgery or something of that sort then you've got serious issues happening that pineal sits deep deep near What's called the fourth ventricle and it absolutely should not see light directly so the idea that the pineal is the third eye in humans is not true it just isn't true so anytime someone says oh the pineal is your third eye that's not the third eye center that people are referring to when they talk about meditation now you'll see a number of different um forms of art where somebody will uh it will be a picture of a face and the eyes will be closed or sometimes open they'll be literally a third eye like a cyclops eye in the middle of the forehead that has been proposed for many thousands of years to be quote unquote the seat of our Consciousness now that's interesting because that real estate behind the forehead actually turns out to be the prefrontal cortex which we know from lesion studies and stimulation studies if you remove that brain area people become very reflexive they are not thinking intentionally they don't become deliberate in fact and this is kind of an eerie result but if you inactivate you turn off the prefrontal cortex and you give somebody the opportunity to play a shooting game for instance their accuracy goes through the roof they become essentially like a machine they see a stimulus they shoot at they see a stimulus they shoot at it their accuracy is exceptional but their ability to distinguish between enemy and friend completely disappears so they become a highly effective motor or I should say sensory motor machine but their assessment and their judgment about right or wrong completely disappears this is also true for people that have prefrontal damage they often will have inappropriate behavior or hard time suppressing behaviors Etc so the third eye center as the seat of Consciousness and Our intention is something that makes sense generally with what we know about the Neuroscience in neurology but there's something more to it that I think is especially important for all of you that goes beyond anything about ancient Traditions or pineals or birds or snakes and pits in the top of the head and here's what it is the brain itself meaning the brain tissue does not have any Sensory neurons what do I mean by that well if I touch the top of my hand I can feel that if I want to sense my heartbeat if I work at it I can feel that if I want to sense how I feel internally at the level of my stomach is it full is it empty am I hungry is it acidic it does it ache or does it feel Pleasant Etc I can sense that and that's because we have Sensory neurons on our skin and in our body Etc we also have Sensory neurons in our eyes that let us perceive things externally we have no Sensory neurons on our brain this is one of the reasons why you can remove the skull and do brain surgery on somebody who's wide awake and be poking around in there and they don't need any anesthetic on the brain itself they need anesthetic for the incision site but they don't need anesthetic on the brain because it has no feeling you have emotions but there's no feeling so normally we are perceiving and paying attention to what we are sensing either externally sights and sounds again exteroception or internally interoception touch Etc but by focusing our perception or in and our attention not on our bodily surface like a body scan but to a point a couple centimeters or inches behind our forehead we essentially are bringing that attentional that perceptual Spotlight to a location in which there is no sensation there's nothing to feel there and when we do that by closing our eyes and focusing on that quote unquote Third Eye Center which is the prefrontal cortex to be quite honest when we do that something else happens and what happens is when we are not thinking about and perceiving our Sensations because there are none there our thoughts and our emotions and our memories sort of mushroom up they more a better way to put it would be that they geyser up and take on more prominence in our perception what I mean by this is that normally you know I'm not thinking about the contact point between me and this chair but as I'm speaking I'm in contact with the chair and those neurons are firing but if I focus my energy and attention on them they're going to fire the same but more of my perception goes there similarly I'm thinking things all the time you are too and I'm perceiving things all the time and I'm remembering things all the time and I'm anticipating things all the time about the future but by focusing my attention on the one organ for which I have no sensation that is my brain well then thoughts feelings and memories feelings meaning emotional feelings start to grow in their prominence in my awareness and in my perception and so this is why when you sit down to a meditative practice if it's a meditative practice where you close your eyes or you're focused on that third eye center where you're focused on your brain as opposed to your bodily surface or something external to you the thoughts seem to come by in waves and they can almost be overwhelming it's very hard to as it's often described just sit back and watch your thoughts go by because there are so many of them actually the best way to stop thinking is to really focus on something external or to focus on sensation that's less thinking than it is perceiving senses okay so I don't want this to get too abstract when people talk about the third eye center they're not talking about the pineal they're talking about prefrontal cortex and when you direct your own attention to the very area of your brain that directs attention there's nothing to sense there the only things that will become present to you are feelings emotions that is thoughts and memories and they will often arrive in what seems to be a very disorganized fashion and the reason they arrive in somewhat disorganized fashion is because normally we just don't perceive things that way normally we are splitting our Attention our perception that is to multiple things our sensation and our thoughts when we put all of our perception into our thoughts we see how disorganized how wondering they are and how in fact how random and intrusive those can be again random and intrusive and much of what we talked about in that paper earlier the one where they ask people what are you doing and what are you feeling and how happy or how unhappy are you are what they discovered was that most people are sort of in their head a lot they're not really present to what they're doing which leads me to the statement that I believe at least based on the data that paper included that most people have an interreceptive bias they're focused more on what's going on internally than they are focused on what's Happening externally there are certainly people who for the opposite is true but I think that this is an issue because we hear so often about the need to do a meditation practice that allows us to focus Inward and that we're going to yank around by all the stressors of Life etc etc and we are we're getting yanked around by all the stressors and demands of life but as we do that we tend to be very focused on what's happening with us the data clearly points to the fact that being Mindful and being aware can enhance one's level of presence and happiness but we can go so far as to say that being Mindful and aware of what's Happening not just with us but external to us in our immediate environment that includes what other people are saying and doing that also can really enhance our sense of well-being and happiness at least that's what the data point to ,non-well-being
calculus the mathematical study of how things change it includes differential calculus rate of change using slope as a function and integral calculus determining quantities like areas and volumes under changing conditions two people are responsible for calculus Isaac Newton the guy behind the laws of cartoons the guy who had publicized light is made up of particles called Karpis gills which allow us to see color when they enter our eyes or just the Apple guy and Gottfried Leibnitz boat Newton and Leibnitz are independently responsible for the foundations of calculus that we see today now did calculus start with them of course it didn't let's go back in time to far Babylonia was an ancient Mesopotamian state comprising of modern Iraq Syria and Egypt the capital city Babylon was about 60 miles from modern Baghdad babylonians offered an early intuition on the infinite process they could determine the square root of a rational number to any number of decimal places a contributing factor was their sexagesimal number system that allow for a compact notation sexagesimal number system has a base 60 that means they represent all real numbers using sixty symbols this is different from the base ten or the decimal number system that we use today the ten symbols being the digits 0 through 9 Babylonian mathematics recorded their research and observations on clay tablets called cuneiforms this is a famous cuneiform that shows that the diagonal of a square is root 2 times its side they were also able to define other numbers with potentially infinite precision like the length of a year or even represent the value of pi fast forward to 300 BC Babylonian astronomers thought everything that happens in this world from changes in the weather to rise and fall of tides was associated with the motion of planets so the Babylonians used geometry to study the motion of planets specifically Jupiter since their God Marduk was associated with Jupiter recording velocities at instantaneous times they could determine how far the planet travels in an interval of time this was similar to finding the area under a curve with the trapezoid rule which forms the basis of integral calculus that we see today did they do everything of course not around the same time in ancient Greece were the prominent figures Eudoxus of knidos and Archimedes they were able to prove areas of shapes through the method of exhaustion for normal polygons say an octagon we split it up into a number of triangles and find the area of each triangle then add it up to get the area of the polygon circles are a special case since they can't directly be split into triangles half a circle is just half a circle so they inscribed a polygon and gradually increase the number of sides so the area of the circle would approximately be equal to the area of the polygon but the area of the circle would only be the same as the inscribed polygon with infinite sides from this we got the concept of limits and it also incorporated the idea of the infinite process onto the medieval era India had their share of contributions - in the 12th century mathematician and astronomer Bhaskar - wrote the Siddhanta shadow money which contained texts in astronomy with proofs using calculus he proved the added size point the instantaneous speed of a planet is zero actually I don't know what that means but that's what it literally says in this paragraph of a news article in a language you don't care about and this paragraph talks about how some English mathematicians called Newton and Leibniz are known for this discovery even though Basquiat said it a few centuries earlier one of the greatest mathematicians and astronomers in the 14th century India madhava linked the idea of infinite series with geometry and trigonometry he was able to formulate infinite series expansions for sine cosine arctan and even pi so you see these expansions here you know the one that we call the power series expansions but nope they're actually called them out of a series this is the mod of a sine series is the model of a cosine series and this is them although arc tangent series but if he did find this then why didn't mother but get the credit himself we can't find his work the only sources were the mathematicians who reference him Newton and Leibnitz and other Western mathematicians were 300 years too late the history of calculus and mathematics isn't straightforward different countries came up with their own methods around the same time using this knowledge we attribute its flourishing as a promising field to the people who tied it all together Newton was a physics buff his calculus was defined out of necessity to lay the foundations of gravitation and the laws of motion so it's no surprise that he thought of calculus in terms of motion and called his calculus the method of fluxions a variable of interest was called the fluent and it's velocity was called the flexin while Newton thought of his calculus in terms of motion Leibnitz had a more mathematical interpretation to him calculus was more sums of infinitesimal distances the same meaning behind the notation we use today and so most of the notation we use is actually from Leibnitz so who took the credit for calculus Newton conceived his ideas in the 1660s while Leibnitz came to similar conclusions a decade later but Lena's published his findings nearly a decade before Newton well initially it was Newton but after their deaths both were attributed the title inventors of calculus regardless as we've seen calculus wasn't invented overnight it's a branch in mathematics that has multiple roots from thousands of years ago and it continues to power newer fields like machine learning and AI if not for all these people some of us would be doing different things hope you guys like this little tension from the hardcore math videos I've been dishing out lately subscribe for more content on data Sciences and I will see you in the next one ,non-well-being

sit down look a little bit forlorn hydra microphone bro you don't even have a microphone this is so cringy okay futurism let's talk about it okay so what is futurist cooking all right to give a quick rundown of things peaches cooking was something coined by marionetti in the 1900s as a way to revitalize eating as some sort of performance art or culture practice he did so by including gastronomy music sense into the mix to creative absolute original or innovative practice however this came at a cost the abolition of pasta to marionetty pasta was heavy nationalistic and patriotic it also disrupted the equilibrium the consumer since it was something that swallowed not masticated so it wasn't ideal however though this movement wasn't some sort of long-term trending thing we still see remnants of it in current cuisine might not be 100 italian but let's look into it today i bring to you okay so the word messi is derived from the word which is short for italian and messi which means meal and japanese so this is a genre of japanese italian fusion dishes but if you look at some of these recipes are on this recipe site some of them are not exactly made with italian ingredients like the first one which means simple curry fried rice taste italian dish this one which is a spaghetti dish that's based off of the italian spaghetti with napoli sauce looking at these recipes though some of them are made with japanese ingredients or ingredients that might not be seen on a traditional italian dish or at least for this one would be which is uh onion or ketchup which is ketchup which i assume that is part of the tomato based sauce that they're using but they also do have italian elements in the dish like shiro wine which is something that's used in the original napoli sauce so does itameshi actually carry remnants of that futures cooking culture that we're looking for that was my task for today and with a friend we went on a quest to a japanese italian restaurant in search of a new gastronomic [Music] long as you're experience with me to be drunk and in love in new york city i like me better [Music] before we could grab the table we ended up looking at their menu and there were a lot of japanese italian pasta dishes and some japanese and italian and tea pastel uh [Music] [Music] i like me better when i'm with you when i'm with you for real okay so what do you think about the food today it's your question i thought the food was really good because i really enjoy pasta i definitely think it's more japanese style because compared to the other pastas i've had before this one is a lot more sweeter the moment we walked into the restaurant itself they can tell by the mural you can tell it's gonna be fusion but like but they did try to put like all the volcanoes in that barbie stanford like it made it seem like was more italian but asian i guess in that sense the atmosphere itself was pretty loud yeah it was definitely it doesn't feel more welcoming to talk though like just to enter and be able to chat with your friends just because they're so loud not that i was also kind of asian the way that they put the appetizer and a house at the same time because usually with course meals they usually put the appetizer in first in front of your person you kind of split it and eat it but then this time they just put the appetizer and the pasta yeah the minute it's ready to serve to you yeah i think mine you know i guess like squinting itself it's already pretty asian to use that kind of style dish and these shirazu and shrimp in there so that definitely gave it to asian styles first and they also have that post jack on top too oh were they yeah there's a question in there actually speaking that b-roll it was interesting how the fact that they gave us chopsticks instead of forks to use why do you think it's so popular i know it's like definitely altered for an asian palette in general is probably catered towards the more globalized but that appetizer though but that was actually very italian though it tasted it felt really italian too even in um when i visited japan before when i went to italian restaurants in japan obviously like the staff are japanese and like the restaurant and the whole culture is japanese but they wouldn't serve they didn't serve that dish we had a prosciutto pretty much i feel like out of the entire experience that we had that in itself is already like pretty italian i would like not say pretty italian but they're their attempt of making everything italian style that's true especially with olives so this experience does it actually relate to futurist cooking well if you search at the definition of futurist cooking in the dictionary i don't expect you to find it mischievous in the definition i mean ita misty dishes are mostly pasta dishes which is already a big no-no in futurist cooking but i do think that it was a new gastronomic experience well a key concept in futures cooking is the concept of renewal the futures wanted to make italy a light modern country so basically something that could compete on the global stage i mean japanese italian relations aren't something new either like we see in fantozzi where he takes the secretary out to dinner now one episode it was filmed in a japanese restaurant in a way that would have gotten a lot of backlash in the current time that particular episode also showed a lot of adversity to foreign food like the raw fish causing indigestion or the particular way the japanese threatened fantozia and the secretary when they want to dissipate the restaurant rules on leave i also think that this is a concept that we should take into consideration when we talk about itamesi but rather than the clashing civilizations that we see in pantozi i would say that italian food has morphed through movement migration and exchanging ideas into this genre of japanese italian dishes that we see nowadays so that in itself had become a new gastronomical experience where surprise japanese ingredients have altered the taste of italian pasta dishes giving it a new sensuous feel using chopsticks at the restaurant also allowed us to consume the food more slowly and savor it more and this has also appealed to a globalized audience as well because the dishes aren't as heavy as they used to be but in conclusion itameshi isn't exactly futurist cooking but it does contain elements that contribute towards the future's agenda and their new innovative pasta dishes also act as a foil to counteract the reasons why that the future is disliked pasta all right so that's it for today don't forget to drop a like comment and subscribe just kidding but i'll see you next time bye oh [Music] short story ,non-well-being
" I think we might be screaming tomorrow, I don't know yet. The problem is that they told us, K-doll told us, can you guys scream tomorrow at 1 p.m. And I don't wanna be that guy, I don't wanna be that guy, but I like to... I don't wanna wake up so early, doesn't make sense? I also if we could push up the time a little bit. Top three changes you would make for League, good and bad, what would you choose? Hmm, not the one, Revered the bounty system to be what it used to be, Revered the death timers, the respawn timers, so that it was it used to be, and then Revered give me back a Prouder's claw, and then we have a game, Revered Horsesel and Plating Gold. Ow. continuer, Oh bad! Always level 2 flash on Wallybear. You will guarantee burn their flash as well and you win the trade. OP strat. I'm gonna look for a dive here. Bum plating. Oh, I still get it! Come on! That's gonna be a first blood to me and wave crashed which means that the next wave is gonna be pushing into me which means that I don't have to use TP. Whereas he has to use his TP. Beautiful stuff, beautiful stuff. Skywheel only has to farm with his Q now. He walks up, he takes heavy trade. What is his champion? He gives farm every minion with his Q. Oh, you're dead. Oh, okay. You get to kill. Give you a kill here for free, we go. No problem, you know. I ain't got all the taxed of entire, okay. Of course if you play League of Legends and you get hit by Shogaf Q, you're actually boosted at the game. Shogaf Q is the hardest ability to hit in the entire game. We have the skillshot. Or maybe we'll say an ult actually. We say an ult is hardest one. Say an ult is the only ability in the game that boooooooom when you use it. So alert every enemy on the game that you're coming. Maybe we should say an ult is hardest. He's ult because 100. Bring down the storm! And the dive potential is ridiculous because you have insane damage and you have sustain. And then you can disable towers with the ultimate. That is just you just diving your opponents, okay. That's what you do. You are the messy of League, you dive dead. In AP Voli, that's always what you're gonna play. When you play lane Voli Baron, you're always gonna go AP. Important to keep your pass above. It is really key for your damage. This should be really good. He's gonna E me. You gotta help me, I don't know if he has ult or not. Nice. It's a party! Hello! What is happening? We got a rod. I'm out, I'm out. This is too much. He has no ult. Should be free. Bring down the storm! You just become this insane monster of a champion when you play Voli. Completely unstoppable. I can order it in front of me. Game 5. T1 vs. Low Seratonus. Oh man. Busy FFS. Band out. Sign on the Gregus. We clad the Queen. Oh no. Brings out the bear. The bear comes out. What are you doing up here? What are you doing up here? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can you explain why and when you build those shoes? Swiftest boots I have? Why build them? Because they're the best. When? Always. There's no single champion in the game I don't build this on. Except Queen. Queen and Kane. I build other boots. I don't love this. This is super troll by me. I'm gonna die. Oh he missed. That was close. I'm not gonna lie. I'm kinda popping off this game. Swiftness coming in clutch. You need AP on Volley Bear. Not a Rabadon's AP. You don't need 500 AP. You need a handbread. You need a handbread or 200 AP on Volley Bear. That is so that you have wave clear. Health is the best stat on Volley Bear because of your W. Your W becomes overpowered with health. And then you need CDR. Go speak Rye Rocket Belt. Have all of those. And you have mobility. I have mobility as well. Bro, this is how you build Bastard on the champ. Don't go for that road of age. Just neighbory quick play bullshit. That is so bad. Always go this build guys. Come here. I can just dive him. Get a little bit bad for this guy. I'll back and go top. Back and go bot. You know what? It's a mediary angle. It's such a mediary angle. Now when you have the Cosmic Driver Rocket Belt, do not get baited. Very easy. When you have this nice early game, let's build Nashors. Let's go Rift Maker. Don't fall for that bait. Rift Maker is fine as like 4 for 5. But you want to go tank now. You already have the AP for the wave clear. You don't need more AP. Now you're going full tank. Is this performance we can expect from the Low Sertones top laner? Yes sir. Oh you need to have a little room guy. Fuck dude. Man. This rocket healing. This was bad player. Now I lost the med. H Ans... GG. that here. Can't move for shit. Pretty C, C is ridiculous. 8.5 is crazy by the way. Did I even get hit by anything? I'd like to go spear massage if they have a magic to AP champions and I'd like to go unending despair that gives you enough MR for the magic damage dealers and enough more for the armor damage dealers. Now we fight. This damage is kind of fed I think. The game went downhill ever since I bought the magic man. That's shit. I didn't buy that. This is the play trust. I believe in a sear. Stop. Stop the fucking bags. Stop the bags. A sear. They so didn't stop them by the way. I think I might still get it. I win it. I don't want to flash here because there's no objective up so I might take the death. This guy is kind of big though. There she is. Then I run away. She's like trying so hard because she knows she is the only one who can kill me so she needs to be the one who does it. Oh boy. No. No, my bad. I didn't think the scorn would come from there. I'm totally fine. I can't even flash. I don't realize this is going on. I'm trying to look here. I don't know if I can. 20 seconds for the nila. Two second R.A. Three second nila. Go and go and run. Yeah, we do this. Fuck it. Got the tower. We can run now. Run, run, run, run. We were coming with TP. Same idea here. Nila, the only one who can kill me. Something is going on.

What's better the killer that was the number one highest kill rate or the killer that is the worst killer in the game right now? That's tough guys.

I'm sorry. I know that I never played the game, but I'm retiring from it anyway Yeah, that's a very interesting idea that he just did Okay We're gonna do this thing called wait five seconds, which is actually not super difficult Thank you, oh Okay, that's a powerful reason as to why not Okay, I heal myself oh No, nice the messed up they messed up Okay, okay, okay, they need to reload they need to reload Okay, good good good you guys might need to leave there's no way they get me out of this Well that's a hit on someone That was another useful balance landing on this guy Damn Dude that's not very good footage is it because you don't even see her getting hit so people are just gonna think that she tripped or something Why can killers have DS I mean they could they could have DS a perk that makes the other side stun and they can do anything for a long time. It was called eruption back in the day and You know I was a big fan of it, dude. I love the eruption Especially when I play survival against it It was a big fan of it Big fan of it What am I thoughts on capitalism? Who's who's teachable perk is that from they're saving the capitalism perks for when they add Senator Armstrong that would be really dude That would be really funny to have a Killer that is just straight up like a like a politician, you know Picks free market Government intervention that could be as good as corrupt intervention It could be the same thing as corrupt intervention But you're allowed to run them both and basically every survivor that's not American, you know They have a cool and their their perks stop working tax increase. Whoa. It's a horror game guys, but let's not go that far They go GG easy and then slashe was a viewer goes GG's were played and all good luck with the next I imagine that you know like that guy escaped or they they thought they were the shit and then they go oh, I'm sorry I'm joking Now this is super stupid right? This is literally someone that was like ha ha wow Yeah, who ha ha easy killer and then when they realized that the killer is an actual human being and he's not really bothered They go oh, I'm sorry, you know Even this really stupid interaction shows that if you are just you know if you just mind your business or at least Three people with a bare minimum kindness sometimes some people they they get back from their from their Stupid mindset of being super Antagonistic and hostile and they actually are a bit nicer.

I don't know if that's right, but I see Gdansk who I'm willing to go with one piece of information on that. Now, if you go to Gdansk, you're a stream sniper. OK. I'm going to keep my mouse shut up here. I got to hide my screen. I got to keep my mouse shut. This could be America. That's science at BOS-11. North to Logan Airport. OK. So we're in San Francisco, California. I always have a hard time finding San Francisco, California on the map. Where are you? I'm like, because California is such a big state. You think it would have like a... Oh, yeah, there it is. There it is. California. I always forget the year up there. OK. And then San Francisco International Airport of CO. Of course, it's got to be somewhere. I mean, you got to take an Uber for sure. I don't know how far out it is. Oh, you've guessed, huh? Whatever. I'll just put this right here. That looks like tunnels. 14 points. He was not fooled. Quadruple damage. Scrawl. The mall. Dubai jewelers. I thought that it said twink videos. That's a different sort of situation here. Oh, what a reliable piece of information. Hide the screen. Hide the screen. You'll be hiding our screen immediately. Uh-oh, uh-oh, my stream. I'm dropping frames. I can't, though. Geo, did Geo just crash? Oops. You mad-a-fuck-a-you. Yeah, yeah, kick the dirt. You know what? Well, you're added, go kick rocks. Now, if I falsely accuse you of being a stream sniper and you're not a stream sniper, just know it is better to convict nine innocent men than let one guilty man go free.",non-well-being
" In my previous Noitavideo, I showed the gigantic project that I'm working on, the big alchemy lab that I'm building in order to house all of the materials in the game so that I can then experiment with them all. Just to keep you updated a little bit with that, we've actually made a lot of really good progress, discovering some cool things, and obtaining almost all of the materials that we know are obtainable. There are really only a few left that I have not yet obtained. But anyway, this video is not really about that. Don't worry, I will be making another video going over all of the materials and all of the crazy alchemy. However, during the course of this process over the last six months or so, we have discovered some new and interesting bugs that are related to the amount of time you're in a run for. What exactly breaks when you do super long runs like this? There is something absolutely crazy that happens if you do a very, very, very long run. So yeah, this is just going to be a really short video just showing you new things we learned about what breaks when you do a long run. I first want to thank Dexter CD, who not only discovered the thing you see on the thumbnail, which I'll show you a little bit later, but I gave him my save file when I noticed something going wrong and he ripped it apart. In order to find out exactly what was going on with all of these systems that I'm going to show you that broke. So thank you very much Dexter. Let's go. Liquids in Noita have a special jiggle animation on them to help differentiate them from other types of materials like powders. But if you have a long run going over 72 hours, something might look a little bit off with that animation. It actually starts jiggling twice as fast as normal between 72 hours and 145 hours. What happens after 145 hours? This. This is what all of my liquids look like. There's no jiggle at all. The jiggle animation just completely breaks if you have a run going over 145 hours. This isn't a problem. It's just the animation. It's not the physics of the material itself, but you could be tricked into thinking that the game crashed at times because if you're just sitting still in a pool of liquid and there's no animation at all, you just have this still screen. It actually tricked me a few times. But other than that, there's nothing major. It's just the animation or the lack of one anyway. It just makes things look ugly and like the liquids are made out of gel or something. Anyway, as opposed to that, this one is a little bit more serious or just annoying because if you do a run longer than 145 hours, telekinetic kick breaks and you can no longer control physics objects. You can kick them away and that's the extent of your control. So in my big alchemy run, telekinetic kick is actually an important perk for me since I'm interacting with all the secrets in the game and a lot of those secrets involve moving things like physics objects up to the mountain altar. Unfortunate, but there's nothing I can do about it. Also, as I was just showing, I'm not sure if this is related to the amount of time in a run or this is some other bug I encountered. But this is what the water drops should look like at the beginning of a run. In my run, the entirety of the mines are flooded because as you can see, it seems like the entity that drips the water has been duped somehow, maybe multiple times. So I just have just eventually the whole world is gonna get flooded. However, this is something maybe you didn't know. There are actually invisible entities up here that spawn the water droplets and those entities have HP and can be killed. So at any time, if I'm sick of my world getting flooded, I can always just come up here and kill these things. The next small, purely visual bug at 145 hours, any ones that you have not yet purchased or picked up from item pedestals, they lose their bobbing up and down animation. Again, just a small bug, purely visual, but I wanted to cover everything that I noticed, so there you go. Next is another purely visual bug, but the stars in the sky stop blinking when you hit 145 hours, which we recently learned you might not have any stars in the sky if you've never died in the game. Because stars spawn as you die, but it does hit a maximum number eventually, so you can't just fill the entire sky with just one big star. The next bug affects the luky legs, all the spider legs in the game. In the most extreme case, all of my mecha colmi's throughout every parallel world have completely lost their legs and their ability to move, so my mecha colmi is literally a ball, a stationary ball, or a little guy. But why did these bugs happen at 145 hours? Well, to simplify that explanation, basically, Noita has a frame counter and a separate time-played value. The frame counter is an integer, but the time-played value is a float, and floating point isn't perfect. The further the value gets from zero, the less precise it is. So basically what happens, once that value reaches 524,288, it actually rounds down to zero, and then the value is frozen from that point on. And since the value is frozen, a bunch of things break in the game. There's more stuff that breaks, such as parts of the inventory and levitation component of the player, but I haven't yet observed what exactly happens. It might just be very, very minimal. Alright, and now it's time for the bug of all bugs. Probably one of the most interesting video game bugs ever. If, and this is a big if, if, you can possibly have a run-going for 9,942 hours, the entire world, every solid surface, and object, everything, becomes lightning. If you have electricity immunity, you can walk along this without getting stunned every two seconds and then dying. However, soon after, your movement just completely breaks. You become spaghettified in a way. Unless of course you're stained with teleportation, then you can still teleport around the world. He's witnessing the destruction of everything. And yes, I did, of course, try to end the game while the world was in this state, and as you can see, the gold vein did still get created. Any new materials that I created are still going to get created, but then if they break, then become physics objects or powders, then they will become electricity afterwards or lightning. And yes, of course, of course, guys, of course I also tried sitting inside the cauldron when this happened. This is maybe the alter of permanence after all. What's more permanent than staying inside the cauldron for 9,942 hours? I mean, yeah, I didn't stay there for the whole time, but yeah, of course, I sat inside the cauldron and died via electricity. And as you can see in the end, that screen, the time that this happens, 9,942 hours, exactly. But why exactly does this happen? Why does the world at 9,942 hours become electricity? Well, in the wise words of Dexter, the lightning happens once the frame counter nearly reaches 2 to the 31st minus 1. It actually happens 1,000 frames before that. The reason why it does this is because a cell's electricity charge in the game is stored relative to the frame so for example, if a cell should receive a charge of 2,000, the game will say frame underscore counter plus 2,000 inside the cell. So as frames increase by 1, the charge decreases by 1. However, once the frame counter is near 2 to the 31st minus 1, the result of that addition is a very large negative number instead of a positive number. So this will be true for nearly everything, i.e. everything becomes lightning. Or basically the frame counter overflows and since lightning is relative to frame count, everything becomes electrified until the frame counter overflows once again in another 9,942 hours and that number becomes positive once again. So yes, the world becomes lightning because the frame counter overflows and becomes a large negative number for 9,942 hours. So I mean, if you want to do a run that's nearly 20,000 hours long, be my guest. As sort of a stretch goal in my alchemy run, I am going to see if it's possible to have that run going for 9,942 hours so that I can have this happen legitimately in that run. Hopefully by then, I get all of the experiments finished that I plan. I know Twitch chat. You guys are like, when are you going to do this? Just be patient. We got plenty of time and if you guys want to join the Twitch chat, I am streaming every session of this alchemy run over at twitch.tv slash fury forged. Anyway, if we discover anything else crazy like this, I will let you know. And then once again, after I conduct many more experiments and learn a lot more, we have a long road ahead of us, I will 100% be putting out a gigantic video on all of the alchemy, all of the materials, all of the reactions, all of the knowledge gained by doing this pretty huge endeavor. Until then, thank you very much for watching. I hope that you found this interesting and the races on. Who will have a 10,000 hour run first? If the game updates, then we all get to start over. Anyway, all right, see you.",non-well-being
" Mojang have recently been experimenting with the way that Minecraft Redstone works. Changes to the way that Minecraft Redstone updates have made new things possible, but also some old things impossible, but generally speaking, these changes only really affect the cutting edge of Redstone contraptions. At least, that's what I thought. On December 24th, 2012, I released my magnum opus. This incredibly simple, hidden crafting bench system. But as you can see, in the latest version, it does not work. This Redstone Duster used to cause an update to this piston, making it realize it was powered, causing it to extend, but that no longer happens. And this briefly ruined my week. And I say briefly because I placed a block here, and then the machine started working. And you may think, well, that makes sense because now obviously the Redstone is powering the piston. But look a little bit closer. The Redstone is powering the piston. There isn't extended. I'm now starting to understand why people have troubles with Redstone. Certain bits are completely illogical. This whole system relies entirely on this block. This piston is currently being powered by this block. This Redstone unpowering is what updates this piston to tell it it should be powered. And then this Redstone powering on is what's telling this piston that this block is now unpowered. Why this block makes a difference? In the latest update, I actually don't really know. And it does mean that now if you cause an update to this piston, then it does actually break the contraption because this piston realizes that it's being powered over here. However, if I manage to make two Redstone components and two pistons confusing, for the first time ever, things were not really quite simple. And so begins my quest to continually improve the hidden crafting bench. I genuinely think I can actually make this thing smaller. It will be a little bit more expensive, but I think I can get the footprint to fit within the space created by these pistons. It's going to rely on the same logic, but it's going to use a slightly different system. You see, when I designed this, the observer didn't even exist in the game, but I think... This should work. There it is. Okay, I've managed to make it smaller. And the way that this functions actually makes sense, even if it doesn't look like it does. So effectively, still the same thing is going on. This piston is being powered by this block in the center, but the update telling the piston to extend is caused by this note block, and then this observer sending a Redstone signal into the piston. That is why there is a small amount of delay before it extends. So if you imagine you've got your wall, but kind of in the backroom storage system here, if we stand on this, and on this, we can stand off it and everything gets hidden away. Contrary to what many people believe, you don't often hide a crafting bench because you don't want people using your crafting bench. You hide a crafting bench because crafting benches don't fit in with the vibe of a lot of builds. Okay, what if I wanted to stack my hidden crafting benches up next to one another? Well, this is going to require a complete redesign of how my hidden crafting bench works, which... I mean, it's a pretty good little design. If we make it so that it's powered from the back, that means that we can tile them up next to one another, and then because pistons take a little while to extend, but retract instantly, that should do everything that we need to make a hidden crafting bench. Okay, then I can run a Redstone line down the back, and when I flick this lever, all of our useful blocks pop out of the ground. I gotta say that looks really, really cool, and then when I flick this lever again, everything gets hidden away nice and simple. But now I think about it. If all of them are activating together, it could just be one circuit on the side with Redstone lines connecting up all the pistons. Okay, let's quickly do that, and that... That all seems to be working pretty nicely. Gosh, does this Redstone contraption make sense? This makes so much sense. But what if I don't want them all to pop out at once? What if I say once I access just my fledgling table? No, no, you're thinking surely, you know, you've got this system right here. I mean, these are independent of one another, right? No. No. No, because this block right here, well, it also powers this piston and this piston as well, and it breaks everything. So let's try our best to do something about that. You know, I am really getting the swing of things now, and I feel like I have a good idea. I think something just like this. Yes. Okay. So if I just want to pop out my crafting bench, bam, I can do that. If I just want my fledgling table, flick that one, that's fine. I can then put my crafting bench away, and I can whip out this thing. My goodness, you could even put some observers on top and have copper bulbs. Okay, I couldn't help myself. I had to decorate this one. Look at this space-age build. The crafting benches and smithing tables and things would not fit in this area. This is the correct way to do it. Come on now. This is so cool. I want one of these in my actual house. I forget minecraft. I want this. And the pressure plates are definitely a nice touch, but I wonder if there's a way that I can make this button operate it. Okay. Now, T-flip flop inside of a hidden crafting bench. Thankfully, we do have the copper bulbs, which are like built in T-flip flops. And it's a bit of a chunky one. But it does work. And this, again, this makes a lot of sense. It's not using any weirdness. That's very cool. Very nice. But it's being powered from the side, isn't it? In fact, to be honest, when you're not actually hiding your crafting bench to hide it, it's purely for decoration purposes. I mean, I feel like the lever should be in a better position than this. Okay, let's briefly go back to levers and see if we can change the input position again. What I really want is I want our input to be directly above where our crafting bench pops out. Gosh, this is actually going to come out. Actually, no. What I take that back, I think I have an idea on how to do it. Yes, yeah, this is going to be easy. This is... breezy. Yes. So it's the same as this design over here. Right, inside I've got this little circuit on top, which is just causing an update to an observer, which is causing this piston to spit out his block, which is allowing us to turn our hidden crafting bench on and off. And because it is based on this system over here, it means that we can stack these things up next to another. This is a gift that keeps on giving. I think we can all agree that this is an incredibly satisfying little redstone contraption. 2012 me would not have believed his little teenage eyes. That also 2012 me would have probably taken issue with these levers. I did not like levers at the time. I wanted everything to be buttoned, operated, and that is still the case. So let's fix that. Again, I'm just going to base the design on this one over here. I just need to get a teaflit flop to fit in this space. Hopper... Bold is kind of out of the question. But I guess it isn't? No, no, it isn't. No, this works. This is working really nicely. Or if we wanted to mix things up and make it slightly cheaper, you could do this with mangrove routes, but I think the great looks cooler. And you could probably do something like this. Oh, I do kind of like having water in redstone contraptions. What an incredibly satisfying little redstone build this is. I'm actually going to decorate the thing. Look at this. How cool is this? I want to build this immediately on the Hermitcraft server. There is no need for this build to exist, but equally I want it a lot. But I guess as decorative and as beautiful as this thing is, it's not really hiding anything anymore. It's just more making a nice decorative feature of a redstone contraption. What if we genuinely wanted to hide away our grafting benches? I'll then attaching a redstone torch key to it could be the moose. Okay, let's have a think about this. So this is our floor level, and then yeah, our torch key device needs to be activated there. Because I'd like it to activate on the block that is going to pop up. What happens here? That actually works. And that's a really small redstone torch key accidentally came up with a new design. Excellent. Word then attaching something like this to it work. Oh my goodness, yes. That's pretty ridiculous, okay. That is really, really cool. So if you bit, we've got a little hidden area here, but if I place down a redstone torch, then emergency fletching table pops up out of the ground. Oh my goodness, I just managed to make it even smaller. I just managed to make it even smaller. This is stupid. So there we have it. We've kind of got one for everyone there. Builds there as simple as possible. We've got multi-swappers. We've got individual swappers. We've got button-operated ones. Leaver-operated ones. Button-operated from above ones. And even hidden ones. Your crafting benches are now in safe hands. And successfully hidden. If you enjoyed, now catch you in the next one. See ya.",non-well-being

" Where is the darkest part of a shadow? I mean the obvious answer seems to be right in the middle. If you look closely at a shadow, as you move the object away from the wall, you'll notice that the shadow gets a bit fuzzy, so clearly the edges are lighter. Now we know that light bends around corners, that's a phenomenon called diffraction. So is it diffraction that's responsible for the fuzzy edges of shadows? Actually, no. The reason that shadows have fuzzy edges is because most light sources, like the sun, are not perfectly point objects. So light from one edge of the sun is coming in at a very slightly different angle from light from the other edge of the sun, and that's what gives us these fuzzy edges. It's not diffraction. But diffraction can play a significant role in shadows, and in fact it was the cause of a massive debate about 200 years ago. In 1818, the French Academy sponsored a competition to try to find the best explanation of diffraction. In Augustine Frenel entered this competition with the suggestion that light is a wave phenomenon, and just like any ordinary wave, it bends as it passes around an obstacle. But one of the judges was Simeon Poisson, a harsh critic of the wave theory. He much preferred Newton's idea that light was a stream of particles, and to show just how ridiculous the wave theory was, he showed that Frenel's theory would predict a bright spot in the shadow, right in the middle of the shadow behind a circular object. There would be a spot almost as bright as if the object wasn't there at all. And he thought this was absurd, but my question is, does it exist? Is the brightest part of a shadow really in the middle? To find out, we're going to have to do the experiment. So first I had to find some circular obstacles. I selected spheres instead. I got some marbles and some small spherical magnets. Then for a powerful light source and a large distance to the screen, I selected a lecture theater with a projector. Now the first thing we're going to need is a small aperture for the light to pass through. So I'm going to poke a hole in this card with screw. It's important to have a small aperture because you want the light to be in phase. And that should work if it's all coming out of this small little aperture. But when I put a sphere in front of it, all right, I'm going to hit the lights. Here we go. I can't see a bright spot. I can't really see anything. So next I tried a cell phone flashlight putting a marble in front of that. And again, I could see nothing. I don't see anything in the middle. The idea with Poisson's spot is that light should diffract around a circular object or a sphere. And because the center of the shadow is equidistant from all the edges of that obstacle, all of the light should constructively interfere at that point creating that bright spot. So next I tried an overhead projector. I tried a string of the small spherical magnets. It's weird. I feel like I can see it. Do you think you can see a bright spot in the middle of the bottom one? No. No? I feel like in the very center of each one, I can see a bright spot. Oh. I don't know. My eyes are just totally going nuts up here. Like staring at shadows and trying to see what we want. But this one is opaque. It's nice and spherical. Set it down. And if I adjust the focus, you can see there's a bright spot right in the middle of that marble. So the spot looks pretty good, but something about it didn't sit right with me. And you know, when you think something is true, you really should try as hard as you can to disprove it. What if you used your fingers to kind of make the edges less spherical? Yeah. You know, that's that I think is concerning. The fact that we can still see a bit of spot even though it looks like you're... Right? How is the light getting through and getting there? What was really happening was light was coming up from the base of this overhead projector. Bouncing off this lens back onto the top of the marble and then back up through this lens and onto the wall. So finally, I decided to use a laser. I resisted doing this earlier because in 1818, they didn't have lasers. In fact, Poisson didn't do the experiment. He didn't think that you needed to. The idea of a bright spot in the middle of a shadow was just so ridiculous. And for now, didn't do the experiment either. But one of the other judges, by the name of Erigo, decided to actually do the experiment. And when he did it, he saw something similar to what I saw. So here, I was using the laser through a diverging lens. And then that beam was shone onto a marble resting on top of a loop of tape. So you can see on the wall basically exactly what you'd expect just a shadow of the marble. But when you turn the lights off, there it is. A bright spot right in the middle of that shadow. So the brightest part of a shadow is in the middle, as long as it's the shadow of a circular or spherical object. Now this spot is sometimes called Erigo's spot because he did the experiment and found it. Sometimes it's called for Nell's bright spot because it was his theory. But pretty frequently, it's referred to as Poisson's spot. Harsh reminder that it's not only your great achievements, but also your greatest mistakes. That can be named after you. We don't see Poisson's spot in our day to day lives. For many reasons, one of which is that most objects are not perfect circles. Plus, if they have any surface roughness really at all, that will completely wash out Poisson's spot. And finally, most light sources are not coherent. That is, the waves are not coming all in phase, peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs. So you might think you could never see Poisson's spot under ordinary conditions, but you can. What you need to do is look at a diffuse source of bright light, like a fluorescent tube or the blue sky. You should see some small light specs drifting around your visual field. Now those are caused by floaters. Little particles actually drifting around inside your eyeball. They can be all sorts of different shapes, but some of them are spheres. And so they cast a shadow on the back of your retina, and right in the middle of that shadow is Poisson's bright spot. And that is what demonstrated that light really is a wave phenomenon. And you don't even have to take my word for it. You can see it with your very own eyes.",non-well-being
" What is light? What is light? What is light? What is light? That's a good question, isn't it? What is light? Isn't it an element? Light is brightness, I guess. We have auras. Wheel hub or something? Which are light? Yes, they are. It lights up the room, it makes it not dark. What's the difference between blue light and red light? The color. In your eyes and then you see stuff. They range from white to red to orange to green. It's like the trackers of your body. Can you see my aura? No, not particularly right now. Is it too bright out? It's very sunny out here today. Does that make it harder to see someone's aura? Not necessarily. If I was to explain it to a blind person, right? It would be the difference you see nothing whatsoever as a blind person. Whereas I see things in front of me. To be fair, the question of what light is is not an easy one. For centuries, the greatest minds in science debated this issue. In the late 1600s, Newton proposed that light was a stream of particles or corpuscles. He proposed this in his treaties optics. But at the same time, a Dutch physicist named Hoigens proposed that light was a wave. And this debate raged on until it was settled by the experiment I've recreated today. Thomas Young's double slit experiment. To make sure I got the experiment right, I went to the original source. With the help of Brady Haren, I managed to get into the vault underneath the Royal Society in London. Where is it? There I found Thomas Young's handwritten notes from 1803. I brought into the sunbeam a slip of a card, about one-thirty-th of an inch. In wreath. And observed it's shadow. Either on the wall or on other cards held at different distances. Besides the fringes of colors on each side of the shadow, the shadow itself was divided by similar parallel fringes and small dimensions. Wow. This is an experiment so simple that you could make it at home, and yet so fiddly that I have never seen it before done with sunlight. I was thinking about doing it in a box, like a fridge box. And you could take it out on the street. Taking it out on the street. Could I possibly interview you guys for about a minute? We're doing a science experiment. I have here is an empty box. And this is a little eyepiece where we can look in. And this is a hole. And I'm going to place this slide above that hole. And if you look closely, you'll see that there's two openings. Very narrow opening side by side. It's a double slip. Now before we have a look, we need to tilt it towards the sun a little bit. So we want the sun to hit this double slip directly. What are we going to see on the bottom of the box? You think you're going to see, you're going to see two lines. Two lines on the bottom of the box. Two bright banks. Two little lines. I think it'll be one line for two. I could expect you to see the whole box lit up. It'll probably be a kaleidoscope of some sort. A bunch of colours. Probably here. Rainbows, different colours. There, have a look. You expected to see kind of one line. Is that what you see? No. I see dots. How many? It's one circle. There's one in the middle strongest. Two either side. The two on the outside are multi-colored. And the one on the middle is just white. And kind of a rainbow? The rainbow colour as well. Quite a few colours. And lots of little dots. There are more dots appearing. I think I can even see more dots spreading along. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, I can see tons of dots. No. Not tons, but I can see dots spreading. Of course that way. Yeah, definitely. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, that's incredible. And that's just nothing else apart from two slits. Two slits. What kind of one? That's incredible. But all we're doing is we're putting a light through two very narrow slits side by side. So how does this make any sense? There's some kind of principle involved in it. But the average person is not familiar with it. That's the only explanation. No, I'm really confused by it, but I'd like to find out why. People were debating is light a wave or is it made of particles? So what causes that? Well, if light were behaving as particles, you would expect them to go through each slit and just produce a bright spot underneath. So we would see two bright spots on the bottom of the box. But if light's behaving as waves, then the wave from one slit can interact with the waves from the other slit. I've got a demonstration here on a little pond where we can see this with water waves. I have two sources of ripples, which are basically like the two slits. When I create ripples with a single source, they travel out with circular wave fronts. Nothing particularly surprising there. But if I add a second source of ripples, then we start getting an interesting pattern. This pattern is created by the ripples from the two sources interacting with each other. Where they meet up peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs, the amplitude of the wave is increased. That's what we call constructive interference. But if the peak from one wave meets up with the trough from the other, then we get destructive interference, and there's basically no wave there. And this is exactly what was happening with the light. When the light from one slit met up, peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs, they constructively interfered and produced a bright spot. But if the trough from the wave from one slit met up with the peak of the wave from the other slit, they would destructively interfere and you wouldn't see any light there. It's light cancelling itself out. This is basically the same as having two drops of water fall in a swing pool. Exactly the same. As this ripple overlaps with those ripples, down the bottom, you get a series of, you get a bright spot, and then a dark spot, and then a bright spot, and then a dark spot. There's a slight complication, which is that sunlight is composed of many different colors, and they have different wavelengths. So obviously they're going to meet up at slightly different points. And that's what caused the rain-bowing effects as we go further from the central maximum. You saw the ones to the right were slightly colored. Yeah, it's that kind of marking. The reds are going to meet up at different places than the blues. And that's all that makes the color difference is the different wavelengths. Exactly. That's amazing. So the difference between reds and reds? So the reds are going to be over there and the green part is just, I'm seeing that. It's a different wavelength. And that's how we bring in all these beautiful colors all around us. Exactly. That's amazing. I'm an amazing. Oh, get on you, thanks very much. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm Jason Lawson. Listen to me. Now you may have noticed in that experiment that the light on the bottom of the box was not in the shape of slits. Rather they were more kind of round blobs. And I want to know why that is. Can you write an answer for me in the comment section? And I'll give you a hint. One of the videos I've linked kind of suggestive of the answer. So convincing were the results of Young's double-slit experiment that the scientific community concluded that light must be a wave. There is no way it could be a particle. Thank you.",non-well-being
Western Civilization has contributed more than any other to the development of human learning people all over the world emulate our University Systems our scientific methods they use theories originally developed in the west as the foundations for their own scientific research and yet Western kind has lost faith in itself and become deracinated from our own intellectual roots we bought into the narratives critiquing our civilization coming from our professorial class as a consequence we have simply forgotten the actual intellectual foundations that allowed for the ascendancy of our people we unlocked the secrets of nature we discovered the principles of the physical world and harness the forces of nature not through through some violent revolution against the Western intellectual tradition Galileo Kepler cernus these people saw themselves as firmly in line with the Pythagorean platonic lineage of philosophers they drew inspiration from the Ancients the philosophical naturalists that are popular today would like to affect a kind of reset on intellectual life it's sufficient for us to Tinker around conduct experiments think for ourselves using modern Common Sense we can throw out metaphysics who cares that the platonic oratian worldview gave coherence to Western intellectual life for more than two Millennia inconsequential we can just trust the science and figure it out in our lab coats it's ridiculous obviously the intellectual tradition matters it is why we're here it's why we were the ones to reach the moon we were the ones to split the atom if we are going to set our civilization back on course we have to take ownership of that intellectual tradition no one else will learn it for you and if our generation lets it slip then it just won't be a living tradition anymore the scientific material s will have won out and I think will have suffered a great loss intellectually and also I think as a people I don't see how we could survive without being Tethered to the source that made us great not that it's all on Plato of course Plato was in his own tradition of philosophers he was a Pythagorean in his own right and Pythagoras didn't invent his philosophy he drew inspiration from the Ancients of his day days lately online I've been teaching platonic philosophy running reading groups doing texts of Plato Aristotle the neoplatonists I've been using the eblan curriculum over the last couple years and that was of course developed by the neoplatonic philosopher yamus all of the schools of antiquity merged into the neoplatonic school of late Antiquity so stoicism aristotelianism platonism it was all brought together the other schools basically died out so for the last few centuries of the ancient world neoplatonism was philosophy and they developed this curriculum for initiating students into the philosophical tradition I think we need to go back to our intellectual roots and we should actually use the curriculum that the Ancients used and then build from there if you want to understand Christian Scholastic philosophy you better understand neoplatonism because that's where it came from when the Byzantine Empire absorbed the formerly Pagan schools at Athens and Alexandria they adopted their curriculum they adopted their philosophical Concepts and categories Christian scholasticism is a continuation from Hagen neoplatonism it also has plenty of insights neoplatonic philosophy on modern-day scientific problems there are people who identify as neoplatonists in the modern day like Michael Levan making breakthroughs in biology or John Veri coming up with a viable theory of relevance realization and of course Roger Penrose there are plenty of modern-day platonists it's still a workable school of thought it's just not in line with the mainstream scientific material ISM and it is hard to get into and then of course you have our own adversaries on acts and so forth who fall in line with a kind of straussian platonism they value the ancient texts but they don't read them in the traditional way they read them through a modern lens they too would just drop all of the metaphysics stuff and look at it as some kind of commentary on The Human Condition or something like that no the metaphysics matters the theology matters being connected to the Divine matters in concepts of the political and we have all of the documents we need from the ancient world to get back into their mentality the Ancients understood Plato better than modern people modern Scholars can accomplish an awful lot and there are some great modern Scholars of platonism like uh Lloyd Gerson out of the University of Toronto it is up to us to learn this stuff I am going to be resetting the eblan curriculum this is the only chance if you want to get in on the reading groups from the start this will be oriented towards total beginners in philosophy platonic philosophy and so we will do two sessions a week we're starting in a couple weeks so sign up I'll provide links in the description where you can sign up I'm using a course software this time I'm going to post quizzes and course materials uh but you can also still sign up at patreon.com AOL for 10 bucks a month that'll get you access two sessions a week Fridays 3 p.m. central Time we'll do readings of the texts with commentary and then Saturdays 10:00 a.m. Central we'll do a lecture and Q&A a so this would be the time to join if you want to discuss with others or be able to ask questions as you go um I think it is the best way to reconnect ourselves with our tradition you can't just start with the Scholastics because they assume this prior philosophical Heritage you have to start with the Ancients the beginning of it is Plato and there was an ancient way of teaching Playdoh that we can simply use we're actually going to start with a unit on Pythagoras uh Pythagoras is a very interesting character most people don't know too much about him he had a cult or something and taught in a cave uh there are a lot more details than that that we do know that we can get into uh immensely significant in the history of ideas it was Pythagorean mathematizing of Natural Science really that was the move that led to Western ascendancy and the rest of the world has really not caught up since then the Arab world for a little while but that's because they had access to the Greek ancient texts while the West Was severed from the tradition we now have a clearer view than people did even a hundred years ago of our own intellectual uh Heritage as a people so we should take advantage of that there are excellent modern commentaries available we're going to go through a ton of texts and this group is going to be going for quite a while so I encourage you sign up for that even if you probably won't consistently participate consider just supporting I do need the support to be able to do this otherwise I may just have to go back to work I am hosting students now if you want to come down and stay here while doing the Aman curriculum we'll also do bonus inperson material that won't be online um contact me directly you can message me on

hi this is muho from osaga every year around this time I'm spending some time writing small calligraphies or actually I don't call them calligraphies by but Cog graphies um because they're not so super beautiful uh this year I did this Eno some people call it a Zen Circle for my friends and the people who support me regularly on PayPal and Zen Masters love to do these circles sometimes they are asked for the meaning of it what does it mean does it stand for Perfection because the circle doesn't have any Corners no edges or maybe the circle stands for the Moon the Moon of Enlightenment that brings light into the darkness of Illusion or maybe it's picture of a Japanese rice cake Moi about 30 years ago I spent one year in a rinai temple in Kyoto and the roshi there Fukushima Kido roshi traveled to America every year and he gave speeches at various colleges and universities and often he also gave calligraphy demonstration and he also used the opportunity to make pictures of circles and sometimes usually he would do Japanese calligraphy but sometimes he would write something English so in the case of the circle he would write see me touch me bite me and this year I used only the third one bite me um and only after I wrote These I found out on the internet that bite me seems to be in modern day day English a slang for leave me alone leave me alone um but what the rosi and what I try to communicate here is of course the other thing for example um a couple of years ago not a couple of years ago a couple of weeks ago uh in the Monday Zen and Zen Zoom classes that I do together with schwen uh friend of mine that's living in Tokyo a Chinese yoga teacher living in Tokyo um every Monday or every second Monday I talk about the song of the treasure mirror samadi in Japanese it would be the hoko zami and this text starts with the lines the Dharma of thusness the Dharma of thusness was transmitted by Buddhas and ancestors now you got it preserve it well and the question of course what is this Dharma of dness that was transmitted by Buddhas and ancestors and the answer of course is this it's this and the next question is of course but what what is it what is it what is this circle and the answer as well see it touch it bite it not leave me alone but get into contact with this reality that you're living right now and actually I got from some of my friends that received it already I got the response well I did bite into it but it wasn't edible it wasn't edible um I I don't know maybe you find a way to get into contact very intimate contact with this Dharma of thusness that each single one of us has been living their whole life but most of the time our mind is completely somewhere else and even if we ask for the meaning what's the meaning of this what's the meaning of this all or in my case I've been asking myself since the age I was seven and I lost my mother what's the meaning of life what's the meaning of life and that's a good question it's a valid question but it already takes you away from that Dharma of dness rather than asking for the meaning of it you need to see it touch it bite it get immersed in it okay so thank you everyone for watching and especially thank you for those that support me regularly through PayPal and if you don't know how you can support me as well if maybe next year or so you would also like to have one of these you will find a link in the video description that will take you to my support page thank you for watching ing have a nice time enjoy your day see it touch it bite it ,non-well-being
so you read a little NY it's all peachy you go online ignore everyone getting screechy watch some vids and you see people talking discreetly about nichan ethics the creation of values re-evaluation of morals or transvaluation but no one seems to be giving any real examples and everyone seems to have different ideas on the how why and what the results would look like no one seems to have the concept packaged neatly little do they all know there is a really good example of creating your own values or trans valuation as given in the story of dun there is a scene in the first book where Paul is confronted with a dilemma he has proven himself as a warrior and a worm Rider to proceed forward he is expected to kill sgar in fact to kill sgar would be just and honorable by freman Norms so what is he to do not killing him is Unthinkable by freman standards and yet where no one else can see a path he forges a new one by not killing sgar and having him remain in his position of authority he isn't just making a political play by inserting a new rank above SI leader he is literally unbinding himself from the morals customs and traditions of a people and showing them a new ethos now you may say yeah but isn't Paul superhuman isn't he the quizat hyak yes true but he has attributes that we ourselves can cultivate to a certain degree specifically prence prience is forethought or foresight this relates mythically to both Prometheus and certain Gnostic sects that use forth thought as the name of a being that descends and AIDS Sophia in her Fallen State and in some Greek myths Prometheus wields an axe which he uses to Aid in the birthing of Athena wisdom from the head of Zeus wisdom knowing forethought or foresight are all intimately connected but how do we cultivate these things within us and in what way does this grant us the agency to transv valuate our lives well let's add a little GFF to the equation gergy burgie has a system called the work later dubbed the fourth way which relates a simple technique simply called self-observation basically you are practicing a type of detached watching on yourself while going about daily living you're not actually trying to change anything you do per se you are merely watching your being's reactions to Impressions while you are in the world the data you collect through self-observation is categorized in three ways that is reactions or Impressions or functions that relate to one the intellect two the emotions or three motor instincts what one begins to notice through prolonged self-observation is that we humans are like machines just like how when you put a specific input into a computer to get a specific output we humans if we are given specific Impressions or Sensations will always react to it in the same way every time by continuing self-observation we begin to not only know notice all of these outputs or functions But realize they are interl example you notice via self-observation that A peculiar string of thoughts are in your mind you realize that these thoughts have Arisen from a particular emotional state that emotional state only arose once you were sitting in a particular posture therefore posture you have learned leads to an emotional state which brings thoughts of a particular quality to your conscious awareness in this way you begin to notice the Interlink nature of your being as a system sometimes a thought will arise within you from seeing something externally this thought will then be the cause which generates Associated emotions which themselves will impact the body by becoming tense in certain areas other times The Impressions will impact you directly through the emotions which then arise certain mental and sematic reactions in parallel and even still sitting alone in a blank room old old Impressions and Sensations will arise out of memory what he said at work or what she said to us in high school or that one thing that happened that one time that always makes you cringe you know what I'm talking about through self-observation you begin to grasp a chain of cause and effect that runs through the functions of your human machine once you have this you can begin to change through hindsight your aim gives you a purpose whether it be to reach the higher cylinders GFF the Superman nii or the quizat hatak Dune you can now discard the categories of Good and Evil and merely ask is this useful did eating 12 pizzas bring me closer to the Superman or should I have done a workout was watching hours and hours of black pill content worth it or should I have spent that time learning an instrument or even just listening to music that I like through hindsight we judge our actions by how useful they were in bringing us closer to our aim this leaves behind all moralism and unexamined values that might have restricted us from moving forward and through developing the soil of hindsight we may experience the first sprouting of something new called foresight with foresight and hindsight the geometry of our being gains a new side fundamentally we have three selves now one of the the past that reaches forward through time to tweak our machine so we don't make the same errors and another self in the future that reaches back through time through foresight and warns us of dead ends in our path these two are reconciled in one our present the difference between us and others Normy NPCs is now our past our future and present are in constant dialogue this new dimension of time time is added to our being once you have this the only difference between you and your peers in the work will be differences in degree some will have developed a little foresight whereas others will seem as if eternity itself speaks through them now the only problem you'll have is if you can foresee your future trials will you have the power to triumph over them this now is a different question not one of Consciousness but one of will of fum but that that is a talk for another time and now a word from our sponsor ra Shadow just kidding there is no sponsor but you know what I do have a Kofi account if you could be so kind as to drop me even as little as $5 I can buy myself more cofi to keep me awake at night thank you very much ,non-well-being
there are ships sailing to many ports but not a single one goes where life is not painful this is a quote from the book of dis quiet by Fernando basoa my favorite Portuguese writer this was really formative um to my character because as I've mentioned before on this channel I misspent my 20s vagabonding around Europe and not creating any roots or particularly solid bonds so this quotee shook me to my core because it helped me understand the world not in a fatalistic Bleak perspective I don't think Fernando P was trying to promote despair I think this is a pragmatic acknowledgement of mortal life Universal mortal life not even suffering is certainly not unique to humans other earthlings are also privy to this luxury so I don't think it is an Earthly thing might be Universal for all Mortals alike this was pivotal for me to understand and uh appreciate Beauty joy and the endless precious moments that make life so unique so I have talked about Fon p in the past and and this is probably one of the most requested videos on this channel but it did take a long time for me to make it and the reason why it took about six months for me to make this video pretty much the entire time that I've been on on booktube is because I was avoiding cognitive gout allow me to explain Fernando P's writing is extremely rich it is Rich like port wine and blue cheese it is so rich in lyricism subjectivity and it has a strong focus on meta language which is um when we use language to talk about language itself to reflect on its structure to explore its function and to study the craft of writing itself so I reread a lot of his work poetry and Pros to refresh my memory and I also read uh some books about him by Scholars known to study P we're going to talk about them a little later on in the video for now allow me to remind you if you like books words and stories this is definitely the channel for you don't forget to like And subscribe and hit the notification Bell so you don't miss any of my videos check out my community tab I'm always posting polls quizzes stuff and um yeah so welcome to the linguist Library let's talk about the man himself Fernando P was born on the 13th of June in 1888 Lisbon Portugal and for the beginning of his life everything was fine until his father passed away from tuberculosis his father was a known music critic and his younger brother soon passed away between the ages of five and six a lot of tragic things happen in his life but fortunately for Fernando pooa his mother was extremely strong his mother is from the assoas the Portuguese islands and they are known for making people made of steel um so she remarried and um they ended up living in South Africa because she remarried the Portuguese Council for South Africa so Portuguese is from the P's first language but he was educated in English his first literary um moment happened when he was 12 he wrote an essay on the British historian moli and he signed it with this family name pesoa which originally had a circumflex Accent on top of the O but later on in his life he wanted to expand his uh reach and he wanted to be a bit more International you could tell this by his keyboard which was something that he created he manipulated so that he would be able to type in five different languages which back then without a digital keyboard was quite difficult but yeah so he dropped the accent to become a bit more Cosmopolitan he worked as a translator for British magazines he translated um Portuguese Proverbs for a British editor called Frank Palmer he but he is really unique when it comes to writers because of his heteronyms so his heteronyms which he very kindly explained to a friend on a letter a few more notes on this subject I see before me in the colorless yet real space of a dream the faces and gestures of cero hiard haes and a the compos I have constructed their ages and lives hiard Hayes was born in 1887 I don't remember the day and month but I have them written down somewhere in Porto is a doctor and is currently in Brazil Alberto CA was born in 1889 and died in 1915 he was born in Lisbon but lived almost all of his life in the countryside he had no profession ession and almost no education a the compus was born in Tav on October 15 1890 at 1:30 p.m. V Gomez tells me and it's true because after doing the horoscope that for that time it matches as you know he is a naval engineer from Glasgow but is now here in Lisbon inactive Cayo was of medium height and all though he was truly frail he died of tuberculosis he didn't seem as frail as he really was iard ha is slightly but very slightly shorter stronger but lean I the compos is tall 175 m 2 cm taller than me thin and slightly inclined to stoop all clean shaven Koo blonde without much color blue eyes Rays vaguely dark compos between light and dark vaguely resembling a Portuguese jew though his hair is straight and usually parted to the side and he wears a monocle cero as I said had almost no education only primarily schooling his parents died early and he stayed home living off a small income he lived with an old Aunt a great aunt hik haes educated in a Jesuit college is as I mentioned a doctor he has lived in Brazil since 1919 as he voluntarily expatiated himself for being a monarchist he is a latinist by external education and a semi helist by self-education Al the compus had a regular high school education later he was sent to Scotland to study engineering first mechanical then Naval during One Vacation he made a trip to the uran which resulted in an opary he was taught Latin by a beta born Uncle who was a priest how do I write in the name of these three cero by pure and unexpected inspiration without knowing or even calcul ating what I would write hi after an abstract deliberation that suddenly concretizes into an OD compos when I feel a sudden urged to write and don't know what my semi heteronym Bernardo Suarez who in many ways resembles Al of the compost always appears when I am tired or drowsy so that my qualities of reasoning and inhibition are somewhat suspended that Pros is a constant Daydream he is a semih heteronym because although the personality is not mine it is not different from mine but simply a mutilation of it he is me without reasoning or effectivity the pros except for what reasoning gives faintly to mine is identical to this and the Portuguese is perfectly the same while CYO wrote po poor Portuguese compos reasonably well but lapses like saying AIO instead of mismo Etc hay better than I do but with a purism I consider exaggerated it's difficult for me to write the pros of hay still unpublished or of compos the simulation is easier but because it is more spontaneous inverse so later uh in life when he returned to Lisbon he learned French because that was the defecto language of the Portuguese Elite um the European Elites really at the time he published um I think I only read one of his stories in French and uh most of his early stuff that he he published while he was still alive was in English so he has a collection um he was strongly influenced by Roman poets like Horus in fact the entire Western Canon was uh very well treasured by him so he was familiar with Cervantes Shakespeare all the Roman poets that I just described but also each one of his heteronyms was influenced by a particular writer most of Fernando P was work was not published while he was alive so he lived from 1888 till 1935 his famous work was mostly written between 1914 until 1934 35 and everything that was published during his lifetime was mostly in different languages in English specifically so he had a collection called Anton uh and then in English and then he had a second collection 35 sonnets which were both published in 198 he has a collection of English poems third collection which was published in 1921 and he gained notor Rarity because of a national competition that was um trying to find the Portuguese Spirit uh it was about nationalism and national pride right so this was 1934 and this is when he published mening which is patriotic mystical collection that contemplates past glories from the Conquistador era through modernday Portugal it Rhymes in Portuguese um but I found a way to translate it in English that also Rhymes but Loosely it would be all is worth the stride if the soul is wide so when it comes to his book um the translations that I found are quite varied so you have Richardson's translation you have margar Joe Costa with um jono pisado who's a scholar on Fernando pooa and they have translated the complete works of each heteronym separately Zenith chose to put a collection of all three of the main poets as well as Ron himself together in a collection called a little larger than the entire universe this is by penguin modern Classics and you also have the selected poems which was not translated by Richard Zenith but it is an older translation and it was awarded a poetry translation award called pen in 1999 so for his Pros you have the book of theet this one being the latest and this was translated by the Colombian scholar jono pizo and the Superstar translator Margaret Joe Costa who is my favorite translator for this combination from Portuguese to English um I've referred to her as the Kelly Clarkson of translation and I stand by that statement Richard Zen of's biography pesoa a biography was a finalist for the pulit a prize and I highly recommend it I read it for this video and he superb he is such a a well of of um knowledge such a well of information when it comes to F pesoa I am anthology by The Marvelous Geronimo pisaro and this is where I found out the 77 exclusive heteronyms that I didn't know of before including his female um heteronym so it's a total of 136 heteronyms that F created in his life before I go I'd like to read you a poem this one is called poem in a straight line and it's by the heteronym a de compos I never knew a s who ever took a liing my friends have all been Champions at everything and I I so often vulgar so often obscene so often vile I so deliberately parasitical unforgivably filthy I so often without patience to take a bath I who've been so ridiculous so absurd tripping up in public on the carpet of etiquette I so grotesque and mean submissive and insolent who's been insulted and not said a word and when putting a word in growing still more ridiculous I who strike chambermaids as laughable I who few Porters wink sarcastically I who's been scandalous about money borrowing and not paying it back I who when the time came to fight duck as far as I could out of the punching range I who go into a sweat over the slightest thing I'm convinced no one is better than I am at this sort of game no one I know none of my speaking acquaintances ever acted ridiculous ever took insults was ever anything but Noble yes all of them princess living their life lives how I would love to hear a human voice from any of them confessing not to sins but to infamies speaking not of violent but cowardly acts but no each one is a paragon to hear them tell it is there no one in this world who would confess to me he's been vile just once all you princes my brothers enough I'm fed up with demigods where are the real people in this world am I the only scoundrel and burglar alive maybe women don't always fall for them maybe they've been betrayed but ridiculous never and I who have been ridiculous but never betrayed how do I speak to their highness highnesses without stammering I who have been so vile literally vile vile in the meanest and rottenest possible sense of the word ,non-well-being
that you used to go up on Mulholland Drive and park every night and visualize seeing yourself as yeah I would visualize uh yeah this is where you were broken poor right having directors interested in me and people that I respected uh um saying you know I like your work or whatever that is and and uh I would visualize things coming to me that I wanted or whatever so didn't you write yourself a check I heard that you did is that true I wrote myself a check for 10 million dollars for acting services rendered and I gave myself uh five years or three years maybe and uh and I dated at Thanksgiving 1995. and I put it in my wallet and I kept it there and it deteriorated and deteriorated and stuff but then just before Thanksgiving 1995 I found out that I was going to make 10 million dollars on I think it was Dumb and Dumber Dumb and Dumber yeah yeah so you visualize yourself throughout history the most successful artists athletes and inventors have used a secret technique to create their success there is no difference between you and these great successful people other than they had the ability and knowledge to harness these techniques these techniques are never taught to the average person which is a shame because if used correctly they can transform one from poverty to wealth from sickness to health Napoleon Hill set the greatest sin of all of mankind was the neglect to use this greatest asset he said if you use this acid you will have everything you want in abundance he didn't say within reason he said everything in abundance stay tuned to the end of this video and I will show you step by step how to use this secret technique to get everything you want in your life but first here's what a few people you may know have to say about it when people talk about visualization how does visualization help with that you wrote a lot about [Music] my dreams and visualizing kind of really played a role in to making me motivated and helping me achieve the goals that I had it is everything for me I literally sat down two three months before and I've made a decision in my head that practicing regularly their visuals running in my head me dominating that bullet I had to Envision it because if I didn't I wouldn't be here so not only did I Envision it I envisioned it so much so clearly and so precisely in my head that I'm here now and visualization is a it's a huge factor in improving technical skills when you focus on something and you really things can really happen in in your life visualization still can actually cause a rewiring of the brain beneficially I visualized I'm sitting here on the steering we're visualizing a brand new car and visualizing good things in in times of struggle we had done it a thousand times in his head he had warmed up and backstage he had heard a crowd he had smelt the arena you'd see in the audience he would really immerse himself in the in the in the fight night so by the time Fight Night come along he's the walking on yeah this is my thousandth time doing this with all of these great people are doing is seeing their Vision in their Mind's Eye in in 3D before they achieve it if you want to change the station on your TV you change the frequency if you want to change the station on your radio you change the frequency see your mind is an electromagnet once you charge it with a clear image of what you want you change your frequency you change your channel and you magnetize it to you you no longer have to chase after it anymore it will start to chase you see this is better than the Law of Attraction it's called The Law of assumption it was first discovered by Neville Goddard Goddard said assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and continue therein and the universe has no choice but to harden your assumption into present fact Goddard said it's not about believing in it it's about believing it in don't broadcast what you want simply assume you already have it this will create the deja vu effect you rehearse a situation successfully in your mind and then it happens in reality giving you the deja vu feeling or oh I've already been here before now this capacity is not inborn in fact I'll show you how to do it at the end of this video but first here's a few people you may know who have used this technique Aristotle said the soul cannot dream without pictures Vincent van Gogh said I dream my painting and then I paint my dream the great Walt Disney when he was on his deathbed he was interviewed by a reporter on his final day the reporter told him sir you have this amazing Epcot being built by your friend Ken Kerr but you will never see it how does that make you feel and then Disney looked up at him and said you don't get it if I didn't see it you'll never see Roger Bannister the man who broke the four minute mile said he did it because he visualized it many times before the race he said he visualized the event to create a sense of certainty in his mind and body he would close his eyes and see the race step by step he would create the image he would he would see the finish line and hear the crowd in his mind little known fact Roger Bannister went on to become a neuroscientist in his book mind gym Gary Mack says that Brazilian soccer player Pele before every game would go to the locker room an hour earlier before everyone else he would lie down using a towel as a pillow and cover his eyes he would watch a film of himself as a kid playing soccer on the beach in Brazil this movie in his mind brought back glorious memories and he would vividly recall the thrill of the game and the joy he would immerse himself in the Love of the Game in short before every game he would put himself in touch with his pure love for the sport after that Pele would watch himself reliving some of his greatest moments in World competitions he would let himself feel the winning moments and enjoy the intensity and those feelings over and over he talked about how crucial it was to make a strong connection with those images and feelings finally he would see himself as he was about to become playing brilliantly scoring goals in a mental movie made up of positive images of enjoyment and Triumph he imagined everything before it happened the field his opponents his team he saw himself playing Like A Champion a force that could not be stopped he said remember it's not just about the visuals and the imagery it's more about the feelings the emotions associated with success he vividly imagined how good it all felt only after 30 minutes of this visualization would Pele then start to warm up and stretch his actual muscles he primed his mind for victory and Pele who some say is the world's greatest soccer player of all time was Unstoppable all of these great people harnessed the power of the law of assumption to succeed now you may be asking yourself are there any scientific studies that support the power of visualization or the law of assumption well the answer is yes in 1996 a study by Dr Bia Soto from the University of Chicago was conducted via Soto split his participants into three groups and tested how many free throws they could make he had the first group practice shooting free throws for one hour he had the second group just visualized themselves making free throws and he had the third group do nothing after 30 days he tested them again the first group who practiced shooting free throws improved by 24 the third group didn't improve at all but the second group the group who only visualized themselves making free throws improved 23 without ever touching a basketball there was another study where people practice the five finger piano exercise for two hours a day they showed a similar increase in brain activity as those who practiced solely in their imagination without ever touching a keyboard scientists have confirmed that the brain does not know the difference between a vivid imagination and reality therefore using visualization you can actually improve performance without actually engaging in the activity see that's why Einstein said imagination is greater than knowledge in another study scientists have the participants imagine flexing their biceps as hard as they could for five times a week in a few weeks they increase their bicep strength by almost 14 percent without ever doing a curl and there are other studies that have had similar results okay now here's the part that you've all been waiting for here's how you create success in your life through the power of visualization you can use this technique to succeed in any area of life from earning 10 million dollars like Jim Carrey did to overcoming stage fright or anxiety in dating and it only takes 10 minutes a day set your time you can do this by sitting in a chair or if you prefer just laying down now there are two ways to do visualization the first is you see the scene playing out in your mind but through your own eyes as if you are already there the second way is to see yourself on a movie screen this is called Mind theater Studies have compared the two methods and the first method of seeing it through your own eyes is more powerful but for me I like to do both of them now the first step is to relax your body relax your eyes relax your face relax your shoulders relax your entire body it may take up to 10 minutes to get into a completely relaxed state but this is important because relaxation allows the message to enter your inner subconscious now the next step I got from the silver method which is all about putting your mind into the Alpha Brain State what you want to do is you want to visualize the numbers three and then two and then one and then you go into Alpha State the Alpha Brain state is a state of creativity and learning it's also called The Flow State now after you do this I want you to fully immerse yourself in the environment of your goal see yourself with the gold image whether it's winning the race holding the trophy cashing the check walking into the house Etc remember the greater the detail the quicker the attainment of your vision include images of overcoming adversity see yourself fighting your way out of things overcoming it and reaching success the next step is bringing in Big Time emotion intense feeling into the visualization Goddard said feeling is the secret the next step is to make it Vivid Vivid Vivid make it clear remember the clearer the more detailed the vision the quicker the attainment next I want you to engage all of your senses I'm talking total sensory immersion what does it feel like to move your muscles is there any wind what does the ground feel like underneath your feet are there any smells in the environment the grass the outdoor what do you hear how are you breathing feel the rise and fall of all of these senses and emotions and finally just feel enthusiastically how it feels to have already achieved your goal behave as if you already have it believe that you already have it and that's it you can do this for 10 to 20 minutes every day this technique this secret if done correctly will turn you into a magnet attracting everything you want in abundance I mean think about it look around your room right now everything you see came out of the human mind came out of the human imagination and therefore imagination creates reality action turns into fact how many science fiction movies became fact nearly all of them the biggest problem that most people face is imagining what they don't want which is why Napoleon Hill said if you spend as much time visualizing success as you do thinking about failure you would change your life once again guys it's not about a feeling of craving of wanting of Desiring because that will simply push everything away the law of assumption is about matching the vibration as though it is already done because as Neville Goddard said assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and the universe will have no choice but to harden that assumption into present fact peace ,non-well-being
artificial intelligence and machine learning what's the difference are they the same well some people kind of frame the question this way it's AI versus ml is that the right way to think of this or is it AI equals ml or is it AI is somehow something different than ml so here's three equations I wonder which one is going to be right well let's talk about this first of all when we talk about AI I think it's important to come with definitions because a lot of people have different ideas of what this is so I'm going to assert the simple definition that AI is basically exceeding or matching the capabilities of a human so we're trying to match the intelligence whatever that means and capabilities of a human subject now what could that involve there's a number of different things for instance one of them is the ability to discover to find out new information another is the ability to infer to read in information from other sources that maybe has not been explicitly stated and then also the ability to reason the ability to figure things out I put this and this together and I come up with something else so I'm going to suggest to you this is what AI is and that's the definition we'll use for this discussion now what kinds of things then would be involved if we were talking about doing machine learning well Machine learning I'm going to put that over here is basically a capability we'll start with a Venn diagram machine learning involves predictions or decisions based on data think about this as a very sophisticated form of statistical analysis it's looking for predictions based upon information that we have so the more we feed into the system the more it's able to give us accurate predictions and decisions based upon that data it's something that learns that's the L part rather than having to be programmed when we program a system I have to come up with all the code and if I wanted to do something different I have to go change the code and then get a different outcome in the machine learning situation what I'm doing could be adjusting some models but is different than programming and mostly it's learning the more data that I give to it so it's based on large amounts of information and there's a couple of different fields within couple of different types there is supervised machine learning and as you might guess there's an unsupervised machine learning and the main difference as the name implies is one has more human oversight looking at the training of the data using labels that are superimposed on the data unsupervised is kind of able to run more uh and and find things that were not explicitly stated okay so that's machine learning it turns out that there's a subfield of machine learning that we call Deep learning and what is deep learning well this involves things like neural networks neural networks involve nodes and statistical relationships between those nodes to model the way that our minds work and it's called Deep because we're doing multiple layers of those neural networks now the interesting thing about deep learning is we can end up with some very interesting insights but we might not always be able to tell how the system came up with that it doesn't always show its work fully so we could end up with some really interesting information not know in some cases how reliable that is because we don't know exactly how it was derived but it's still a very important part of all of this realm that we're dealing with so those are two areas and you can see DL is a subset of ml but what about artificial intelligence where does that fit in the Venn diagram and I'm going to suggest to you it is the superset of mldl and a bunch of other things what could the other of things be well we can involve things like natural language processing uh it could be vision so we want a system that's able to see we might even want a system that's able to hear and be able to distinguish what it's hearing and what it's seeing because after all humans are able to do that and that's part of what our brains do is distinguish those kinds of things it can involve other things like the ability to do text to speech so if we take written words Concepts and be able to speak those out so this first one involved being able to see things this is now being able to speak those things as well and then other things that humans are able to do naturally that we often take for granted is motion this is the field of Robotics which is a subset of AI the ability to just do simple things like tie our shoes open and close the door lift something walk somewhere that's all something that would be part of human capabilities and involves certain sorts of perceptions calculations that we do in our brains that we don't even think about so here's what it comes down to it's a Venn diagram and we've got machine learning We've Got Deep learning and we've got AI so I'm going to suggest to you the right way to think about this is not these equations those are not the way to look at it in fact what we should think about this as machine learning is a subset of a high and that's how we need to think about this when I'm doing machine learning in fact I am doing AI when I'm doing these other things I'm doing AI but none of them are all of AI but they're a very important part thanks for watching please remember to like this

"like a lot of doubt that anybody would want to listen to me but I need to change my mindset a little bit and I'm really going to give it a shot as of today and start working harder to put out you know really good quality content and try to do what I love I left my day job at the age of 24 solely by a couple different side hustles and Investments I've since created a sixf figure business and achieved kind of lean Financial Freedom and I was able to do pretty much all that just through self-education by reading like over 100 books and really just by experimenting and trying a bunch of different things so today I wanted to share 10 lessons that made that possible [Music] when I first heard about the idea of reaching Financial Independence in your 20s and 30s it seemed completely impossible when I looked at other YouTubers who had over 100,000 subscribers it seemed like the same odds of that happening to me as would be like winning the lottery like it's just not going to happen but then I read this book called The 4-Hour Work week and this was the first time I saw example after example of people reaching Financial Freedom in a bunch of different non-glamorous ways then I started listening to podcasts and reading books and networking with people and I met person after person and listened to person after person do all the things that I wanted to do and I realized that there was like a 100% chance that if I never took the first step which for me at the time was starting a YouTube channel then this would never happen for me in fact I have a video of me literally having that realization like 5 years ago I need to change my mindset a little bit and I'm really going to give it a shot as of today and start working harder to put out you know really good quality content content and try to do what I love you know what's the worst that can happen like I I I really want to hit that level and be able to do something that I love each week and not not this crap you know check back in a year from today 5 years later I have you know a YouTube channel that has over half a million subscribers which does not seem real I've been able to build it up into a multiple six figureure business even before all that I was able to follow kind of less traditional path and buy multiple rentals and be able to build up enough income that I could leave my day job even if you take YouTube out of it all those things that seemed impossible ible became a reality there was this quote that really kind of helped me take progress here it's like you overestimate how much you can do in a year but you underestimate how much you could do in 5 years if you just stick with something and you try for something for Five for 10 years your life will be 100% different you can do those things that seem impossible that seems like a good ending networking this is something that I always kind of bypassed until I actually saw results I actually just got tickets for vidsummit and finc con which are two like events for creators it's going to end up costing me multiple thousands of dollars but I started going to vidsummit a couple years ago and after the first time going there and meeting with a bunch of other creators my channel had an enormous Spike and then because of somebody that I met at vidsummit last year paid $11,000 just for the ticket and then hotel and flights as well I have made back about $100,000 from that person that I met there and some ideas and projects that we've worked on together so I literally cannot afford to not network with people because you never know what one person you meet what one idea that you have that can literally make you lifechanging money and turn your life in a different direction it seemed absolutely crazy and the first time I went I knew nobody but just being around people who have achieved my dreams and asking them how they did it made the road to get there seem like possible and plausible I don't know this was always like a hard one for me to actually grasp because you put money in and like there's no clear line of where you're getting your money back but investing into educating yourself and being around other high performing people is for me one of the best investments I have ever made by the way if anybody's going to either of those hit me up let's connect the myth of hard work I was absolutely lied to by people who had the best intentions that if you work hard you know you can become successful and don't get me wrong being successful does take hard work but if I look at the different areas of my life where I have worked hard there have only been a couple that have actually made a positive impact in my finances like when I was cleaning Office Buildings I could work as hard as humanly possible and it wouldn't really change my finances at all like it might make the company do better it might make me not lose my job all good stuff but it doesn't really matter however if I put even 50% of that effort into something that has a much higher scale well now I could earn a lot more by doing a lot less stuff so it doesn't matter as much how hard you work at something as the thing that you are actually working on is it a business that is scalable is it a job that is scalable is it learning the right thing is it doing the right thing the cool thing about owning your own business is you can put a lot of work into you know building this business and then you can get it set up to the point like I have where you can run it in 5 hours a week and you put in less and less efforts but the rewards actually grow and grow and if you're doing that exact same amount of effort but you put that into a a conventional 9 to5 or just doing something else you're just not going to have the same benefits so make sure that you're not only putting in hard work but it's hard work on the right thing now like I said YouTube was that right thing for me and that's why I'm hosting a free YouTube growth workshop and YouTube monetization Workshop like how to make money from a small channel so if that's something you want to check out it's completely free you can register down below find your freedom number this was yet another lesson that I learned from the 4-Hour Work week and that is that even this idea of financial Independence and the fire movement that if you save up x amount of money 25 times your annual expenses you can live off that money indefinitely and while that's way better than working to your 65 it's also a very slow approach so I actually kind of took some ideas from this book and a bunch of other ones and kind of built myself a freedom number that if I could earn between $3 and $5,000 a month by building up Investments and my own businesses then I could pretty much do whatever I wanted for the rest of my life as long as I earned that amount of money and I was able to build up Investments through real estate investing and other things in about 3 years from when I actually started if you do the math and you lower your living expenses and you find out that if you make $3,000 a month then you'll be pretty much set maybe not forever but you can live then you have this goal to create passive income not really passive but somewhat passive income in the next 3 or 5 years and if you can do that you will be at Financial Freedom not a million dollar in the bank type of Financial Freedom but it also won't take 10 to 20 years to get there saving half of your income once once I discovered I was that close I did whatever it took I worked multiple jobs I invested my life savings into real estate twice I renovated Apartments I I worked extra I started businesses and within 3 to 5 years of actually taking this seriously and starting I left my day job and I have never gone back to a day job and I've completely controlled my schedule since then I've been able to travel like a month a year and have relative Financial Freedom and have a scalable business all because I realized I was this close to a goal I wasn't like years away I was really close and most of you are too if you restructure what Financial Independence looks like and not try to get away from ever working again but just make a couple thousand a month doing something you enjoy doing that's actually not incredibly hard if you focus for a couple years but the problem is you need to have an obsession in fact I think that is the secret nval who has an amazing book called The Almanac says that you need to be deliberate with your obsessions and if I look at most of the successful people that I know whether they you know built a large Channel they have a you know a bunch of real estate they travel a lot whatever it is that I aspire to for them most of them are obsessed about something positive like when I first started reading different Finance books I became obsessed while I was working cleaning offices I was listening to audiobooks while I was in the car while I was at home while I was at the gym I was listening to podcasts watching YouTube videos listening to books at one point I was listening to almost a book a day cuz I had about 8 hours of listening time I just always had an earbud in and I was just listening listening listening to this stuff I was brainwashing myself I became obsessed I learned so many different things and I tried a bunch of those things and eventually because I was so obsessed about that things started to happen I started to find real estate deals I took action on those deals I never spent money on things that didn't lead to the desired outcome that I want it even with YouTube I think this is unhealthy but I've become obsessed about YouTube how to grow it how to be better how to how to share personal stories better and for the past 5 years I have not really had any days go by maybe one or two that I have not worked on my YouTube channel in some way and because of that maybe unhealthy Obsession I have built the life of My Dreams by just obsessing about something that I knew could change my life life if I could make it happen and then just doing one thing every day to get me closer to that goal and then you zoom out it happened somehow I don't I don't know how it happened it was just I was so obsessed with it so most of us have an obsession if yours is unhealthy like it's social media or it's something else switch it to something that can change your life obsess about a business Investments whatever it is and zoom back a couple of years your life will change copy what works I want to make sure this comes across I am nobody special I'm not overly intelligent in fact I didn't finish High School I would say I'm generally under intelligent if that's that's not corre English I'm not I think I'm proving to my point but what I can do is look at patterns and copy patterns it's true when it came to you know leaving my day job at 24 and reaching Financial Independence I didn't do anything special I just stole what other people were doing and copied it exactly and that's how I've literally achieved everything I've ever done I don't think I'm super original I don't think I'm super creative not super smart I'm like average in all those I'm not trying to like down on myself but I'm just trying to let you know that those people that you know who are doing whatever you want to be doing they're not a ton different than you and most of them actually got help and just copied what was actually working for me I didn't come up with the idea of house hacking you know buying a multi family living in one unit renting the other ones out I stole that from a couple different books I didn't come up with the idea of starting YouTube channel actually don't know why I started a YouTube channel but I assume I stole that from somebody I was actually talking to my wife about this I have no idea why I started it I was just so obsessed about this money stuff that I wanted to share it with people but when it came to Growing that YouTube channel I listened to what all the expert says and then I did what they say so if you're stuck right now and you want to learn something I would recommend not starting from scratch just take a course on whatever business you want to learn and copy exactly what they did and do that if there's anything I want to learn now I pay for a course I copy exactly what they say I generally get really good results but because like 90% of people don't finish courses that's why everybody thinks they're a scam and some of them are but for the most part if you follow exactly what somebody tells you to do who has done it before you can just steal what they're doing and copy it and it will work for you if you do it correctly it's like don't try to get cute with it don't try to be too smart just steal what works screw Dave Ramsey while Dave Ramsey has helped more people than I could ever dream of with their finances there are a few ideas that I just don't personally agree with if you want to go that approach totally totally fine but his General approach is save money invest very conservatively when you're 65 you'll have a few million dollars and that is absolutely awesome for most people I am not most people I a little mentally off and I am okay with that and I personally would rather do a lot more risky things try a bunch of things take complete ownership myself on if I succeed or if I fail and have the chance to build a life that I don't want an escape from have the chance to reach Financial Independence leave my J job when I'm 24 something I would never be able to do if I avoided debt at all cost if I did a bunch of the things Dave Ramsey says and I realized that most people are not entrepreneurial most people don't want the responsibility you know investing in real estate or starting their own business and that is totally fine but if you want to reach freedom in 3 5 or 10 years you cannot do the approach that you know the mainstream is telling you to do you can't even save 50% of your income you need to go a different approach so this just comes down to kind of introspection of you know what type of person you are but for me personally realizing that you know there's not one approach that is perfect for everybody and there's so many different paths to freedom and you know some people love 9 to five some people don't I'm one of the that don't and it's okay you don't have to follow everything Dave Ramsey says you don't have to follow everything and set for life you don't even have to follow everything the 4-Hour Work week but if you can blend these together and and make a life that you love that's where it's at right there just steal a few things that match you copy those and leave the rest it's the same thing with the diet not one thing works for every single person the 31 rule this simply states that for every 1 hour you spend learning studying whatever all which is is very very good for every 1 hour you spend doing that you should spend 3 hours actually doing what the stuff you just read said to do so many people get caught in this trap of like self-improvement where they consume a bunch of self-improvement stuff but they don't actually do most of what it says and that's why you get stuck in this trap and 5 years later your life hasn't changed really at all even though you're watching or reading a bunch of stuff about it and sometimes I I I've done that for sure where I've just read and I didn't actually do anything when I actually started doing stuff that's where a lot of success actually happens so unless you're just getting started in this for every 1 hour you spend learning something spend 3 hours actually implementing it spend 3 hours working on the business and not learning more about it and by doing that you'll learn a lot of stuff that you're forced to learn it's like if you spend an hour watching a video on how to declutter your house spend 3 hours actually decluttering your house and your life will totally change as opposed to 3 hours of watching that stuff and then not really doing anything action almost always beats learning mean as long as you have like kind of a base level of understanding if you enjoy this video you can check out this video for my second Channel which is all about how to grow on YouTube and kind of the business aspects of my life so you can check that out right here and also you can sign up for the free live class that I'm teaching on how to grow YouTube there's a link down below see you next week",non-well-being
"Hey everyone Jason here welcome back. Today we are learning how to shuffle cards for beginners. This is the riffle shuffle with bridge in the hands.
It can be done standing, on the table, in your face, just about anywhere so if you don't know how to shuffle cards you're in the right place even if you do keep watching who knows you might improve your technique now I'll show you the move step by step then we'll see some cool slow-motion footage and at the very end I'll give you some specific troubleshooting techniques first take the cards in your dominant hand you want two fingers on the bottom your thumb on top and one finger on each side then you're going to split the cards about in half using the other hand like that let's try that a little bit slower so your fingers are in this position the thumb from the other hand comes over breaks the cards about in half then it rotates down the other hand helps push it up and over and the thumb takes it on top now the hands should be in a symmetrical position from this position you're going to have to adjust your hands before you can move on there's several things that happen all at once then it kind of looks like this so to break it down as soon as you get into this position if your hands are like this and if you'll notice the thumb is sticking away off the edge and that's not where we want it we need the thumb to be more like that so you can more carefully release cards one at a time first we need to move the thumbs back and I can move the thumbs freely because of the way I'm holding the cards on the bottom securely so move the thumbs back then you're gonna bring the fingers to the bottom and smash the deck into your palm like this I mean I forgot to add you can use all three fingers at the bottom or just two like this whichever is more comfortable so you can securely hold them that way when you riffle the cards they don't fly everywhere it's like you don't need a table because you've created your own table in the air okay so those things happen in fairly rapid succession so from here it's adjust adjust then you're going to turn your hands this and then you're going to move your fingers around to the backside because you need them here to create the pressure at this point you create the pressure you want a lot and you let them individually fall one after the other like that you put your thumb on top I move my fingers around here so I'm holding the cards securely between here and my thumbs and of course these fingers so everything's held very securely right now next you want to bend the cards up so it goes like this you're just bending them up into an arch shape and you really need to keep your thumbs on top like this and you're pushing inwards so everything's kind of stuck there but when I start to release pressure from the bottom they ripple together now that didn't look great because I was going so slow but in real time let's go through it one more time so you take the cards in your dominant hand note the finger position you should be doing the same divide the cards about in half immediately you just your thumbs you bring it in closer to your palm you rotate down move the fingers around then you can start to release the cards and at this point you really want to make sure you're bending the cards enough you have kind of an L shape or like a 90 degree angle on both sides like this push and Bend and basically you're releasing pressure just a little bit here and that allows the cards to start falling now you're not going to damage your cards unless you hold them in that place for a long time like I did but really it's not an issue if you're going quickly because you bend them one way then you've been in the opposite way so your deck is going like that then like this and it's not a problem now let's check this out in slow motion breaking the deck in half rotating it over some grabs the top immediately repositioning the thumbs grabbing the deck and closer to the palm fingers go around the back to create pressure hands are rotating inwards you can see the L shape as the cards are released immediately the thumbs go on top fingers positioned around create the arch and slowly but surely releasing the pressure near the bottom now as promised troubleshooting I actually have four tips to help you here number one perhaps your cards are getting stuck like this that's no good so what's going on here how do we solve that it's easy basically when you're doing this shuffle you need to consider the rotation of your hands so you don't want to be like this you don't want to be like that you want to be deeply rotated enough down because if you're just a little bit rotated it's gonna stick so it's just rotate more downwards like this no problem this no good this real good number to releasing cards more individually unless in huge chunks here's the problem we have large chunks of cards here but it's better to have more of an even mix so how do we accomplish that well it's actually not too hard again you just need to make sure you have that l-shape I told you about that 90 degree Bend because what that does is if you look at the edge of the cards here right now it's hard to release the cards individually because the cards come at a flat angle here so when you bend them enough like really bend them you'll see it creates a bevel now it's much easier to release the cards one at a time so basically just make sure you're bending the cards hard enough and really creating an L shape you get a much better result than before number three now if you're still having issues with big clumps of cards being released all at once try doing this just turn the cards face up because some decks are cut in a different way just shuffling the cards face up could make it easier on you while you're learning give it a try and see if it helps lastly if you're still having trouble trying to learn this move just grab an older deck older cards are more flexible so it doesn't require as much muscle to bend them as well as being less slippery the cards don't slide because they're older when you're trying to learn with a new deck you might find like they're sliding around too much and maybe requires too much force to bend them so just as kind of training wheels you can learn with an old deck but of course you should be able to shuffle with both of them in the future that's it if you enjoyed the video smash like leave a comment below let me know what you thought and if you want to see more

"lots of teenagers are about to get very rich why is that well the data strongly shows that traditional jobs are being replaced and online jobs are booming but surely that means there'll be too much competition in the online space well teenagers have an advantage as they understand the online World better than anyone else it's just second nature but Mark I don't know what to do well that's why I'm going to be revealing the 7.5 best paid online jobs for teenagers and this isn't any old list for each one I'm going to provide a real life example of a teenager currently killing it in that job job one is an advertising deal broker teenagers doing this job earn as much as1 to $120,000 per year in 2021 I bought a Tesla Model 3 and I set myself a bit of a challenge I wanted to see if it was possible to use lots of different side hustles to earn back the price of the car one of the ideas my son and I came up was to get it wrapped like a race car which would involve securing paid advertisements at this point we received a cold email from a teenager called Christian completely out of the blue who said that he was able to secure the sponsorship we required for a 30% commission Christian managed to get an offer of $30,000 on the table had we accepted this deal he would have made a sweet $9,000 for essentially matching us with the brand and acting as the middleman in the end Curtis managed to secure a different deal with public.com so we went with them however Christian has managed to secure many of these deals in the past that's why we can still offer you a free stock worth all
successful with this job is to make friends in the right places he described it a lot like a jungle where one branch would lead to the next one and so on once you start working with one big company it becomes a lot easier as you can reference them as a past client and therefore demonstrate that you have experience in the areas that they require so how does he do it he uses different software to get the email addresses of influencers and just fires off messages until he gets a bite then he evaluates the needs of the clients that contact him back and runs a similar campaign focused on reaching out to brands on the influencers behalf it kind of reminds me of the book How to Win Friends and Influence People where Dale Carnegie talks about sending mail to powerful people and getting replies only the modern day version if we learn anything from Christian it's the power of a good reference and relationships always do your best work because you never know where something might lead in the future job two is a Discord Community manager for web 3 these team make more than $70,000 a year depending on their multitasking ability when it comes to marketing for Gen Z Community is everything every brand Under the Sun is trying to build a community around their product this is actually the main reason why gym shark have set up their first store in London real purpose of the store needs to be to really cultivate the gym shark community and connect with people now if you've ever used Discord then you've probably met a community manager they're like the glue that holds everything together I know a guy called Harry who hires Community managers he said that he wouldn't bat an eyelid at paying more than $2,000 per week if they were good at the job and represented the brand in a positive light additionally if you're good at multitasking there's nothing stopping you from being a community manager for three or four projects at the same time which means big money the job of the community manager is to be on the front line you have to tell the story of the brand be customer service and support as well as supporting people when they're down and paying attention to Global events you need to be able to pause your schedule be active when people are looking for you and listen when people need your attention Above All you have to be the voice of the CEO but not always speak on behalf of the company job three is writing scripts for Content creators these teams can earn upwards of $100,000 but can go a lot higher depending on the type of content and your experience words can make you sound smart or they can do the opposite depending on how they're deployed that's why businesses hire copywriters basically salesman in print copywriters can make insane amounts of money I'm talking over $500 an hour in many cases it all depends on how good you are at making connections your skill with words and how fast you can write some charge as much as $50,000 for just one web page you may be thinking why so much well it's all about value if you charge $50,000 for a web page and it results in a business monthly profit going from $200,000 to $400,000 wouldn't you say it's worth it it's all about leverage making rich clients even richer then asking for your slice of the pie and it's not just websites either people need quality writers for all sorts of things everything from Tik Tok scripts to threads on Twitter content is king and the magician behind all of this is often the writer I know a guy named Adam he started off writing blog posts about his travels to earn passive income and live anywhere in the world this later led him to working as a copywriter for large influencers he followed the same strategy as Christian got one client which led to another and so on he told me when he offers a service he always tries to be exclusive and do it in a way that no one else could there's always going to be someone cheaper than you but not always someone more expensive find the client who can afford to pay the premium then learn to offer a worldclass service job four is a SAS software coder these team can earn between $60 and $80,000 a year a guy called Sam King came on my podcast strike it big and explained how he built a multi-million dollar Business Without ever having a normal job instead of building a traditional business he decided to build a SAS company this stands for software as a service just think of how many online tools you use on a daily basis I know I love notion MailChimp Photoshop and many more these online tools have become such a big part of our life and once the app is built it's almost entirely profit Sam said there's so many people out there trying to sell the same type of product with such tight margin it's a race to the bottom with traditional businesses people start businesses to be free but end up becoming slaves that's why he wanted to create a business with no inventory and something that could de infinitely all he needed was a good coder and a bit of marketing this is where you could help out as a coder or alternatively come up with the SAS idea he started by Googling and researching the problems and challenges faced by different types of businesses then had his programmer create the perfect solution he ended up building a tool that helps people and businesses manage their social media accounts called flick so the one thing to take from Sam's journey is that the most important part of business is solving an issue that affects a lot of people in a better way than what's currently available job five is a Content redistribution editor they can make $120 to $150,000 per year ever had some food left over and decided just to throw it all in a pot and turn it into a soup well that's what someone I know called Josh does but with video content the idea came to him while he was at vidsummit he was in a room with a variety of influences when suddenly a light bulb went off in his head he didn't have to create create his own content he just took existing videos and remixed them for YouTubers that wanted to post short form content he took podcasts and YouTube videos and made them Tik Tok and Instagram friendly giving his clients the ability to reach much wider audiences without actually producing any new content themselves it's called content redistribution it's like recycling but in the digital age it doesn't take too much time but large creators don't want the hassle of editing everything themselves Josh later went on want to hire team member so that he could serve more clients and increase his income job six is a website developer Keens doing this can earn an average annual salary of around 80 to $150,000 per year for many businesses their website is their front door so they want to make it as stylish as possible I've got a friend named Chris who lives out in Italy he decided he wanted to Niche down into the e-learning space and focus on building marketing funnels a good website developer knows that if you keep your clients on a monthly retainer you can earn passive income just by doing small tweaks here and there Chris told me that the best way forward is to start a subscription business with reoccurring Revenue think Netflix he said the best job is one that requires very little maintenance you just keep clients on a retainer and voila he now has enough passive income to live almost anywhere in the world he often travels to cheap countries like Thailand where he can live on less than $1,000 a month he doesn't focus on earning as much money as possible he said that's just just a trap the point of making money is to buy yourself Freedom job seven is a Twitter manager teens can earn around 60 to $8,000 per year doing this job Twitter seems to be the hottest social media nowadays especially since the whole Elon mus takeover I know a College Dropout called sha who wasted a lot of his time trolling on Twitter until he asked himself what if I could actually make a job out of this so he decided to become a Twitter expert he took a lot of time to study the content put out by some of the best creators don't just look at the recent stuff though he told me look at the post that really made them blow up then study it that's what you want to go for he said two of the best ways to blow up nowadays on Twitter is to create threads and host spaces you need to be able to capture people's attention with as few words as possible and hook them in and that takes a lot of practice but this is a very valuable skill to learn just like the others he said he takes multiple clients on at the same time and much like RIS keeps them on a retainer job 7.5 is an executive assistant it's a bonus because it can become more than just an online job these team can make 90 to $110,000 per year you'll be doing everything from scheduling appointments to making small decisions every day a good example of this is Gabe from Neel he does so much for them if you make yourself totally indispensable no one will ever get rid of you and that's the case with Gabe a great perk to this job is potentially traveling around around with these influencers and seeing all sorts of cool and amazing places just like with Christian Gabe understood the power of connections it seems like anything is possible nowadays in the digital world all you need to do is think about something you can offer some kind of value to the world then send emails reach out and make sure everyone knows what you do artificial intelligence is going to be a big moneymaker for teens in the future so if you want to learn how to use AI to get rich then I'm going to leave that video right up there but don't click on it just yet make sure to subscribe if you want to grow your wealth okay

hi this is david stuckler from fasttrack grad and today i want to share with you my secret formula of how to write a paper in as little as a weekend over the past 10 years i've published over 300 peer-reviewed papers in top scientific journals and i've coached hundreds of graduate students on how to do the same and i want to teach you today how to overcome those barriers that you may have to writing a paper fast so stick around to the very end because i'm going to share with you some tips that you may not have ever heard before so the first step is to get everything in place it's like cooking dinner you need to have your onions chopped your tomatoes at the ready and olive oil ready to go if you don't it can lead to confusion too often i i see students trying to write the paper as they go along thinking it's going to be more efficient but it's not writing is the last 10 of your project so don't even bother starting if you don't have that heart of your paper your your findings your figures your tables ready to go tip number two and this is incredibly important and not everybody knows this so often i see students start to write their paper they get stuck they just stare blankly at the computer for hours and the issue is they're trying to write the paper from start to finish going linearly through the introduction to the methods to the result to the conclusion that's wrong that's a mistake and no wonder you're having problems instead you want to write the paper from the inside out you want to start with the methods for many of you this is actually the easiest section to write it's going to give you confidence proceeding that way so start with the methods get that done and then move into the results again this is backwards from how you may have done it before but it's going to help you avoid getting stuck it's going to help you move faster so those results you're going to simply describe in order your tables and figures and your key findings make sure that you've organized those to tell a clear and coherent story about what you want to show your readers and show the editors of the journal where you're going to send the paper the next step the third step is to actually write the conclusion so often i i see people try to write the introduction that's actually the hardest part and where you're most likely to encounter difficulty write the conclusion next now the conclusion has several components that are quite formulaic so in the first part of the conclusion you want to recapitulate your findings restate very succinctly what your keep findings were but don't go into any detail about them yet that's the first paragraph of your conclusion the second paragraph of your conclusion always said again always is the limitations and this is a really great opportunity for you to fend off reviewer criticisms by saying i anticipated that i already knew about that use these wisely i often like to do says first second third fourth just list them out make it very simple for yourself you know what those limitations are you were probably well aware of them they may have even given you nightmares before this is a chance to make them transparent get them in the open state those limitations then what you go into very simple this is very formulaic it's down to a science because of this is what are the implications for future research that's some paragraph and sun right and then what are the implications if any for policy interventions or other action in your field this may not apply to all of you but uh will likely apply to most of the fields that you're working finally now you're ready for the introduction so the introduction again is is the biggest stumbling block and it can be quite difficult but actually it's a lot like the conclusion and it doesn't need to be as difficult as we sometimes make it to be and the introduction is going to have a three-part structure the first part of your introduction you want to set out why are we having this conversation now why is your topic so important why do people care in your field or even more broadly care about it set that up that's your first first paragraph second you want to get into what is the weakness of what's been done before in this conversation what's missing you know what that is you might want to go and do a quick literature review to back up those points why the conversation is important cite the existing studies have been have been done before and what's missing from those and finally you lead right into your study the third part of your intro what is the value that your study is going to bring to the table how are you going to plug those gaps from what's before you really want to take this opportunity to articulate very clearly and succinctly what the value added of your paper is and uh finally last important thing to remember is it doesn't have to be perfect this is another uh common error students make perfect is the enemy of the good i don't care if in this first pass you vomit on the page and it's just complete excrement don't worry you're going to clean it up later think about it like climbing a mountain as you climb the mountain you slowly work your way up to the top and it might be the first pass of the paper you just dump facts and information in that's fine you've got the skeleton you've got the bones of the paper together and then as you continue climbing up that mountain you're going to continue to to polish and clean up and edit that riding so listen if you want more tips and strategies for how to

"Hey there, are you struggling with writing a thesis statement? Don’t frown, Scribbr to the rescue! Hi, I'm Jessica from Scribbr, here to help you achieve your academic goals. Are you ready to get things done? I’ll show you how to write an awesome thesis statement in 3 steps. It’s good to point out what a thesis statement does. It sums up the main point of your paper, just one or two sentences long and usually appears at the end of your introduction. Once you’ve established a thesis statement, you can keep it in mind throughout the writing process and say goodbye to going off-topic. Sounds good? Now, you only need 3 simple ingredients to cook up a great thesis statement. You need to: mention the main topic of your paper, take a position and state your argument, and summarize the evidence you’ll use to support your argument. Here we go, 3 steps to write a thesis statement. Step 1, we need to come up with a research question, so our question would be: What were the main factors that led to the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum? If you want to know how to formulate a strong research question, I have a video on that as well! Step 2, find a tentative answer to the research question you came up with in step 1. Since we’re taking an argumentative approach here, the answer should take a strong position on the topic. So something like this: Brexit was driven by political frustration. And this will be the initial thesis statement. Next, as we keep on researching, we discover more evidence and sources. So keep developing and refining your thesis statement. The final thesis statement should be elaborate, and also summarizes the overall argument. The Brexit referendum result was driven by working-class frustration with the political elite caused by austerity policies that have eroded public services and fragmented communities; the referendum offered an alternative to the status quo. Let’s examine how strong our thesis statement is. The best thesis statements are concise, disputable and coherent. Our thesis statement is concise. It builds up to a central argument, which is Brexit was driven by political frustration and leaves out other information like the consequences of Brexit. To keep it concise, avoid general and vague wordings, keep it in a sentence or two. It's also disputable. The thesis statement took a position that some might argue the other way around. It’s not a simple fact the readers will easily accept, as it requires further evidence and persuasion which encourages readers to keep reading. Our thesis statement is coherent as well. The three parts of a thesis statement; topic, position and the evidence were all well-connected and presented in a logical manner. Depending on the aim of your paper, there are different types of thesis statement you can choose from. The first type is argumentative, which is the example we used earlier. An argumentative thesis statement should take a clear position, since the goal is to persuade your reader of a claim. If you want to analyze, interpret and evaluate different aspects of a topic, then, your thesis statement should map out the key points of your analysis, and briefly introduce the conclusions you will draw from it. For example, The history of the UK’s relationship to the EU is complicated; from the beginning Britain has been reluctant to fully integrate into Europe, both economically and culturally but the politics of EU membership has changed throughout the past 50 years. Of course, your paper also could aim to explain and discuss the facts of a topic. In this case, the thesis statement should summarize the main points you’ll cover. For example, Polling and surveys shed light on the demographics of the Brexit vote, which can be broken down in terms of age, ethnicity, region, and educational level. After going through this video, you should be able to come up with a strong thesis statement for your paper now!

"The introduction paragraph is the first part of your essay, and it's important to start strong. A great introduction grabs your reader’s interest and tells them what to expect. You can write one in 4 steps, just keep watching! Hi, I’m Jessica from Scribbr, here to help you achieve your academic goals. Step 1, hook your reader. Your first sentence sets the tone for the whole essay. This sentence is often called the “hook” because you want to catch your reader and reel them in! Avoid long, dense sentences—start with something clear, concise, and catchy that will spark curiosity. So we’re writing an essay about the history of the Braille writing system. We want to start by saying something like: Sure, that tells us what the essay’s about, but it’s a bit plain and boring. Let’s try turning it into a hook: The invention of Braille was a major turning point in the history of disability. That’s more like it—instead of just stating our topic, we’re making a bold claim about its place in history and linking it to relevant social themes. The phrase “turning point” hints at the big changes we’re going to discuss, without giving too much away just yet. What does your introduction sentence look like? Pique my interest in the comment below! I’m curious! Step 2, give background information. Next, give your reader the background they need to understand your argument. Depending on the subject of your essay, this might include: describing the historical or social context, defining key terms, introducing relevant theories or research, or setting up the different sides of a debate. But don’t overdo it here—save your evidence and interpretation for the main body of the essay. In our Braille example, we first introduce the topic: The writing system of raised dots used by visually impaired people was developed by Louis Braille in nineteenth-century France, and then sketch the social context that the essay will address: In a society that did not value disabled people in general, blindness was particularly stigmatized, and lack of access to reading and writing was a significant barrier to social participation. The idea of tactile reading was not entirely new, but existing methods based on sighted systems were difficult to learn and use. Step 3, present your thesis statement. Now it’s time to narrow your focus and show exactly what you want to say about the topic. This is your thesis statement—a sentence or two that sums up your overall argument. It’s the most important part of your introduction because it defines the focus of your whole essay. A thesis isn’t just a statement of fact but a claim that requires evidence and explanation. The goal is to clearly convey your own position in a debate or your central point about a topic and to indicate the reasoning behind it. So, the main point of our essay is to show why Braille was such an important invention. The thesis statement sums up the two stages of our argument—the innovation of a writing system made for blind people and the social changes it facilitated: As the first writing system designed for blind people’s needs, Braille was a groundbreaking new accessibility tool. It not only provided practical benefits but also helped change the cultural status of blindness. More about thesis statements in our next video on this playlist, but don't head on over just yet... We got 1 more step to go! Step 4, map your essay's structure. Particularly in longer essays, it’s helpful to end the introduction by signposting what will be covered in each part. Keep it concise and give your reader a clear sense of the direction your argument will take. In our example, we map out the three main parts of the essay: the pre-Braille situation, the development of the invention, and the consequences. This essay begins by discussing the situation of blind people in nineteenth-century Europe. It then describes the development of Braille and its gradual acceptance within blind education. Subsequently, it explores the wide-ranging effects of this invention on blind people’s social and cultural lives. By the way, even though the introduction comes at the start of your essay, you don’t have to write it first—if you’re stuck, feel free to work on the rest of the essay and come back to it later. Just make sure you’ve got your thesis statement to guide you—click this video next to learn how to write a strong one! I'll see you there!",non-well-being
"In the world of stock trading, its so easy  to get overwhelmed and lost in the endless   abyss of information that s out there. There s free ebooks, paid courses, and scammy   youtubers. and its extremely hard to decipher what  s good information and what s bad information.   As someone who has had to go through  the exact same scenario myself.   (Yep that s me) I found it extremely   annoying. So that s why im making this exact  video. So you can cut out all the bullshit   and get a complete A-Z guide on how to start  trading stocks if you are complete beginner.   Now im not going to do the usual YouTuber approach  where I wrap this all up in a nice little bow and   make you pay $299 for my course. The best part of this series,   its completely free. (free realestate)   Now after trading for around 8 years, I can  say there s a lot of information we have to   swim through. My job is to go over that  information in a simplistic and efficient   way so you can understand the maximum amount  of information possible in the shortest amount   of time. That s the goal at least. Now theres a specific question I get   asked most almost every single day in my comment  section from new traders. Trader after trader   asking the same, exact, question. That question is .   How much money do I need to start trading? And my answer, might just surprise you. Is   it $100? Is it $1,000? Is it $10,000? What if I told you the answer is $0.   Let me explain. One of the biggest mistakes beginner traders make   is they just instantly jump in the market with  their life savings without any experience at all.   Just because they saw some Stock tiktok trader in  front of a lambo and thought hey that looks fun .   Considering they have no experience, they  lose all of their money, then end up saying   ahh maybe this isn t for me . Then end up  quitting, and never try to trade stocks again.   And the sad part is, this is what  happens to a majority of traders.   What I m about to tell you, is how you  can completely avoid that all together,   so this doesn t happen to you. There are devices called trading simulators   or paper trading. Which is basically a platform  where you can trade with fake money so you can   test things out. Test different strategies,  test your risk management techniques, test   controlling your emotions, or maybe you want to  test out different trading styles like shorting.   Most new traders skip this step, and  honestly its the most crucial step   out there to become a successful trader.  That s why im listing it as my very step.   There are a lot of trading simulators out  there. Some are paid, some are free. But   the one that I would recommend the most is  webull. Just because its free and they have   a really user friendly dashboard to where  its not really confusing and easy to use.   So that s what I would recommend if you want  to try one out. Plus I think they give you,   12 free shares of stock or something like  that if its your first time signing up,   so that s a good bonus as well.   Ill leave a link in my description if you  want to try out their trading simulator.   No, this video is not sponsored by webull.  I just recommend them if you don t have a   trading simulator already. But webull  if you re watching this cough cough.   So what I would recommend doing is  getting on webull, start paper trading,   and just do what you would normally do  if it was real money. But the trick is,   you have to act like this fake paper trading  money is real. Act like its your actual capital.   Put the concepts that im about to teach you in  this video series to the test. But not only that,   take it a step further. Record  every single trade you take.   If it was a losing trade. Write down what you  think you did wrong. Did you get greedy? Did you   move your stop loss? Did you let your emotions get  the best of you? Did you follow your rule set?   Record EVERYTHING. For every single trade. This way, you can look back at what you did   wrong and instantly fix it there and then. This will EXPONENTIALLY speed up the   process of you becoming a better trader. But not only that, you should record all your   winning trades as well. Write down what you think  you did right. That way, you can look back at it   and try to repeat the concepts you did right. When first starting out, you should not be   focused on the money aspect of trading at  all. You should purely be focusing on your   trading strategy, improving said strategy,  and trying to learn as much as possible.   If you do all of this, the making  money part, will just come naturally.   Doing just this, will let you pass 100,000s  of new traders on the learning curve.   This tip in itself is a game changer, im  serious, every new trader should do it.   Thats my first step, on how to start trading  stocks a complete beginner. I was thinking about   making this a video series, where we go completely  from A-Z on how to become a successful trader.   This is going to include everything. Risk  management, trading psychology, chart setups,   market structure, candle stick patterns, trading  strategies, everything. A-Z. Beginning to end.   Everything you need know as a beginner trader. If you guys are interested in this and you guys   get this video to 1,000 likes, Ill  make this a complete series and do   a total blueprint on how to start learning  to trade stocks from a complete beginner.",non-well-being
" Hey guys, so as promised, here's how to sing better instantly. Run, run, lost boy, they say to me. Now I know exactly where you guys are coming from. You're starting off, you're searching around trying to find the right video on YouTube that's going to teach you exactly what you need to know to take your voice to that next level. I know because I was where you are. When I'm a love the woman. I was not good at all. I needed to figure out exactly how to improve my voice. Years later, here's where I'm at. So I'm going to give you guys a condensed version right here of how to take your voice right now to the next level. I want actionable items that you guys can use. The first thing that's definitely going to show you a difference is finding where your voice sits. So for a lot of people, they don't really know how they should be using their voice and what strain-free singing feels like. As a singer that is now able to sing with more freedom, I look back and I realize that when I was singing with a lot more strain, I didn't even realize that that level of strain was actually straining. I felt like that was normal, like that was actually what singing should feel like. So before we do anything else, we first have to get a baseline of what free voice use feels like. So what I want you to do is something that everybody can do. It's just sigh with your mouth closed. Almost like you're thinking pondering about something, telling me we all do, hmm, how does your voice feel as you make that sound? Feels pretty simple, right? Pretty easy. This is not rocket science, it's not a super high note or being held out or a runner. It's none of those very complex things, but it's voice use and does it feel natural, clean, good, strain-free, all of those good things, then you're in the right place. If you want to sing with more confidence and power, then you have to sign up for my lesson subscription. You get two group lessons with me personally every single week. You get access to all my courses and you get access to recordings of all my one-on-one lessons with my students. That will help you learn vicariously through them. Click the link down below to sign up now. So what you want to do is take that and just hold it. So I just want you to go, hmm, hmm, hmm. Now what you're doing is something called a glissando. You may not even realize that you're doing that, but it's a glissando. It's where we take one note and we slide through many other notes downwards. And we're doing that glissando downwards. So what you want to do is take that, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, and just find a note where your voice just rests at that spot. hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, and just let your voice kind of be light, free, as easy as that sigh. You don't want to start going hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, and trying to force things to happen. Let it be as easy as that gentle sigh that you started with. Now I want you to take that sigh and I want you to find that note that your voice generally tries to land on. You'll notice that there always be a note that your voice favors as you come down where it feels like it's kind of resonating the most, feels the easiest to create. So find where your note is as you slide down, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, might be one of those notes around there. Try to find where your voice feels most comfortable, let's do it again, hmm, hmm, hmm, so that one feels a little bit on the low side for me. So let's try it again, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, okay. Slide around a little bit, just try to find it, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, so that right there feels like it's pretty easy for me, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, lifted so it's not down there where I feel like I'm kind of sitting on my throat like it feels a little bit pushed that's what we'd want to avoid so we don't want to feel pushed as we're creating it want to create a nice easy feel as we do it now as you find that note I want you to just drop your jaw let your mouth open hmm now as you drop your jaw you want to avoid things like don't want to do that we don't want to go no don't want to do that we don't want to do that either we want to try to keep it as close to the way the hum was we're just dropping the jaw the reason why I point all these things out is because you'd be surprised how many people end up making those other sounds where you're probably laughing yourself like how could you possibly be making that sound again two thousands of people out there that are trying this video right now are sounding like that so now that I hopefully you found that nice easy flow from the hum to the open mouth position we're just going to try a phrase of a song choose any phrase of any song that you want to sing I'm just going to pick one that's not going to be copy right it here so I'm just going to run with the Canadian national anthem let's roll with that so I want you to just go to that hum our home and native land and you want to try to feel like the words are an extension of that same relaxed chilled hum that you created initially now you might be saying to yourself wait Adam that is not the pitch that I need to sing this song at what are you doing well right now I'm just trying to get you to I mean most of you are beginners out there I'm trying to get you to feel what it's like to create a release sound because for many of you if you're anything like what I started out to be you're creating sounds that are totally not released totally not relaxed you don't even realize it you need to be able to find what is a relaxed released state and then from there try to take that into the range that you're trying to sing your songs at so does this mean that you should always sing your songs low no it does not but what it does mean is that we need to find that relaxed feeling and take it throughout any part of our range so this idea of singing very chilled very relaxed very easy not with strain needs to be carried out throughout your voice now the next question you're probably asking yourself but wait Adam does all singing need to be this relax and this chilled well no because if you're belting a high note you're not going to be as relaxed as it's not gonna be like that because there you're going to be using a lot more breath pressure you're gonna be using a lot more intensity so if you're creating it sound like there is much more intensity behind that you need to engage your abdominals you need to use your vocal chords properly so that they hold back the air flow in the right way but at the same time it's not something where you're gonna feel a lot of tension happening here so it's not gonna sound feel like which a lot of people feel like as they're singing there's a whole bunch of exterior tension doesn't feel clean nice and easy in the throat so the amount of ease in the throat is going to be the same as this hmm we want to get that exact same sort of feeling in the throat as we're singing no matter what we're singing now I'm gonna move on to the next step but if you already feel some strain creeping in and it doesn't feel as relaxed as that initial hum then it's time to stop the video right now and practice with that a lot more until that becomes much easier for you to do you have to be able to take this progression step by step without ever engaging more strain in your throat so make sure that you've got that strain free before you start jumping into this next step the next step is playing around with different pitch variations in the song that you're working on so the phrase that you're working on you want to try to bring the pitch up you want to try to bring the pitch down and see what changes as I adjust that pitch so if we start off with that same one I started off with before now I can try pitching that up now I can try pitching it down and then I can try pitching it up even higher so there you go guys as promised how to take your voice step by step and improve it immediately now there is is going to be an immediate difference for many of you but this is something that you can still practice with and get the hang of over time and it will get better and better as you're able to carry it to different pitch levels in your voice if you found this video helpful then you

"Imagine you were a brand new trader, fresh out of the womb, and you wanted to learn how to make money trading stocks just like the big boys, but you wanted just one place, one video series, to learn absolutely everything—no bulls, just pure knowledge—A-Z, every topic, a complete blueprint on how to learn the market from a complete beginner’s perspective. Well, that’s what you’re watching right now. Yeah, you clicked it. I posted a video a couple weeks ago titled How to Start Trading Stocks as a Complete Beginner. In that video, I said if it got 1,000 likes, I would make this a complete series and teach you guys everything I know from start to finish, and let’s just say you guys got the video to 1,000 likes—actually, you got it to 1,000 likes within 20 minutes! So that shows you guys have a huge interest in this video series. I’m a man of my word, and that’s why I’m making this video. This is part 2 of the series. Let’s not waste any time; let’s get straight to it. First things first, we need to go over some common trading terminology. Us traders have these common vocab words that mean specific trading terms. It’s almost like a secret handshake in a way, but if you’re a new trader, you definitely have to know what these terms mean, especially if you’re going to watch this series, because I’m going to say them all the time. First term is long. To put it very, very, very simply: when you are long on a stock, that means you make money as the chart is going up. So, if you buy a stock at $10, that means you are in a long position, and if it goes to $20, you made money. Pretty simple. The complete opposite of that is a short. A short is when you make money as the chart goes down. Again, I’ll try to explain this as simply as possible. Essentially, what you’re doing is this: say the price is at $10. You then ask your broker, “Hey, can I borrow 5 shares of stock at $10? I promise I’ll give it back.” They say, “Yeah, sure, why not, homie.” So, you now have $50 worth of short shares (5x10). What you want is the price to go down because if the price goes down to, say, $5, you can then buy back 5 shares at $5, totaling $25. So, you got the 5 shares of stock cheaper than what you borrowed them for. You then do a little switcharoo, give the shares back to the broker just like you said you would, and keep the rest of the profit. So in this scenario, you would have made $25. Hopefully, that makes sense. Big picture: long positions make money as the chart goes up, and short positions make money as the chart goes down. Next is bulls and bears. If you’re completely new, you’ve probably heard traders say this before and thought to yourself, “Why are there animals in the stock market?” Yeah, it’s weird, I know, but it’s the lingo. Basically, if you’re a bull, that means you think the market is going to go up in the future or you take long trades. So oftentimes, you’ll hear, “Oh, there’s good market news today, I’m bullish.” If you’re a bear, that means you think the market is going to go down or you take short trades. An easy way to remember this is when a bull charges at you, they swing their horns upwards. When a bear claws at you, it goes downwards. See? You’re a professional trader already. Next, we’ll talk about the spread, and this is when it starts getting really juicy. In trading, there are basically two main prices: the bid and the ask. The bid and ask refer to the prices at which buyers and sellers are willing to trade a stock. The bid price is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a stock, while the ask price is the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept for the same stock. For example, if a stock has a bid price of $10 and an ask price of $11, this means a buyer is willing to pay up to $10 for the stock, while a seller is willing to sell the stock for at least $11. The difference between the bid and ask prices is called the spread, which represents everything in the middle. Oftentimes, when you watch professional traders during live streams, they’ll have this moving data on their screen, and it makes them look really cool and professional. Well, this data is called level II data, and these moving numbers are the bids and asks. The numbers on the left are the bids. So, as you can see here, the highest price someone is willing to buy this stock at is this price, and this number is the amount of shares they want to buy. The numbers on the right are the ask prices. This number right here is the lowest amount someone is willing to sell this stock at. The amount between these two numbers is the spread. While we’re on this topic, let’s talk about the different types of orders. When purchasing or selling a stock, there are different ways you can do it. I’m going to go over 4. There are more order types than this, but these are the main 4 you should know. There’s market, limit, stop, and stop loss. A market order is you basically saying, “I want the stock right now.” No matter what the ask price is, you want the broker to instantly buy the stock at whatever the stock is right now. The pros of a market order are that you know for sure you’ll be in the trade no matter what, but the con of that pro is you’re essentially paying a premium because you’re buying that stock for whatever the ask price is right now. Next is a limit order. A limit order is you basically saying, “If the stock hits this price, I want to buy it.” So, say, for example, a share of stock is at $50. You can put a buy limit order for $40. That means your broker will only purchase that stock once the price goes down to $40. Once it hits $40, it’ll purchase it automatically. The pros of a limit order are that you’re essentially getting the stock at a cheaper price, but the con of that pro is you may not get filled because there are going to be scenarios where the price doesn’t go down to your limit order, and you’ll miss out on the trade. Next is a stop order. A stop order is kind of the opposite of a limit order. Essentially, a buy stop order is you saying, “You only want to enter a trade if the stock goes up to a certain price.” For example, if you have a stock consolidating or moving sideways in a range and the top of this range is at $50, and you only want to enter into this stock once it breaks that range at $55, you would create a buy stop order for $55. Once the price breaks this range and reaches $55, your broker will then purchase the stock. Next is the 4th and final order type, which is the stop loss order, and this is arguably the most important one. Unlike the 3 other orders where it enters you into a trade, a stop loss takes you out of the trade. So, say the price is at $50. You’re in the trade, but you say to yourself, “If the price ever goes down to $40, I don’t want to be in the trade anymore.” Well, what you would do is set a stop loss at $40. If the price ever goes down to that point, your broker will automatically exit for you. So, little recap: a market order is you want to buy the stock right now, no matter the price. You want to enter instantly. A limit order is you want to enter if the price goes down to a certain price. A stop order is the opposite of a limit order, and you want to enter if the price goes up to a certain price. And a stop loss is you want to exit if the price goes down to your stop loss. Now, like I said, it can get a little more complicated than this, but for the sake of this video, these are the 4 order types you should know. These are the absolute basics, but it’s kind of that one thing that’s a little boring, but it’s one of those things we had to go over. To be honest, if this series was an A-Z series, we haven’t even really passed B yet. My goal with this series is to slowly get more and more advanced as we progress throughout the series so that by the time we get to the Z video, you’re basically Einstein when it comes to trading. So, since you guys smashed the 1,000-like goal last video, let’s make this video’s goal 5,000 likes. If we get this video to 5,000 likes, I will upload episode 3, and we’ll get a little bit more advanced and start looking at some actual setups. Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you guys next time.",non-well-being
" Yo, do le, I don't know, yo, do le, I don't know. Hey y'all, welcome to your very first yodeling lesson. This is the video where you're gonna learn the perfect way to annoy your neighbors. No, just kidding. My name is Cassidy, and I have been yodeling since I was nine or 10 years old. It is so much fun, and I'm glad that you wanna learn how to do it too. This series is gonna be all about teaching you the basics of how to yodel, and that way you can do crazy fancy things down the line, like, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel. Today's video is gonna be focusing on breaking your voice. So what is yodeling? Yodeling is going from your chest voice to your head voice really rapidly, and that creates the breaking or cracking sound that you hear when people yodel. Your chest voice is your normal everyday voice, like, eh, and your head voice is your falsetto voice. You know, your upper voice, eh, and when you yodel, you switch between those really fast. The first exercise I'm gonna do is learning how to make the, eh, sound. I think there are a couple of different easy ways to learn how to break your voice. The first one is just pressing going from that chest voice to your head voice slowly, and you can separate the two notes, just to kind of get it into your mind. Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, and then slowly speed it up and try to blend the two notes together, so it's one smooth movement. Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, and then don't even think about it. Overthinking it is gonna make it so much harder, just relax and try to let your voice naturally move into that higher register. You can also try just kind of gliding your voice up to falsetto, like, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, sometimes that's a little bit easier and you'll hear that break. And then we also wanna learn how to do that with the O sound. O, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, and then just speed it up until you get rid of that separation between the two notes and you break your voice into the falsetto. O, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, you can also try it once again, gliding up into that higher register. O, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, I realize my face, I'm probably making really funny faces right now. Then once you master those two different sounds, A, O, you can combine them in one. And once you've mastered those two sounds, you can put them into one yodel like this. Yodelay, yodeloo, yodelay, yodelay, yodeloo, yodelay, yodeloo. You're saying yodelay, yodeloo, yodelay, yodeloo. And just those two breaking sounds. And those are the sounds that you're going to need to know if you want to start doing fancy yodels. Alright, so I think that that's it for this episode of How To Yodel. I hope that you'll take these trips and tricks and you can learn how to yodel too. On this channel, I'm going to be posting more of my original songs and yodeling songs. So if you like what you see here, you can subscribe and you can hit the bell for notifications.

" I have spent the last decade of my life immersing myself in the field of finance and money through a degree in finance, a qualification in accounting, and then a career in investment banking. And one of the most life-changing skills I have learned through at all is how to handle my own finances, recognize my bad money habits, and break free from them. So in this video, I'm going to share with you nine of the most common bad money habits that hold people back and tips on how to break out of them. Number one, paying yourself last. I first heard of this in the book, Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, and it's one of the blueprints in achieving financial freedom. Robert explains that the way people pay their bills can be broken down into two types. The first way is the poor people's habit, and that is through paying yourself last. So as soon as your paycheck comes in, you then pay your rent, your phone bill, your subscriptions, you find your social plans, and then you'll say whatever's left over if there is even any money left to save. The second method he talks about is the rich people's habit, and they do the complete opposite. They pay themselves first, and that is what you want to do. Take 10% minimum and put that into your savings account the minute you get paid. Treat it like paying a bill. This is so important, and by doing this, you're guaranteeing that that money will be saved and won't just slip through your fingers through spending. A lot of people are probably thinking there is no way I can do this I live paycheck to paycheck, but the surprising thing is when you take that 10% and put it away, your mind will think of ways and structure your spending and structure your finances to last for the whole month, and you won't even realise that you're saving in the background. People don't realise how much they're spending on paying the bills, buying something new, going on that weekend away, and then they save whatever's left, but that is the backwards mentality the key is to pay yourself first instead of making other people richer by buying their things before you pay yourself. The second bad money habit is getting comfortable with bad debt. It seems that debt these days is actually the norm. People are using debt to buy the smallest of things, to buy presents, to buy clothes. I have a straight rule that is unless I can afford to pay for that thing outright and cash, I shouldn't be buying it with any form of debt. Remember credit card companies want you to be bad with your finances because that's how they make money from this. The average credit card interest rate is 22%, which cancels all kinds of benefits and rewards these credit card companies are providing if you're not able to pay them off in time. It is not having a stockpile. This ties into point number one, which is about paying yourself first and essentially it's saving enough so that you have a buffer behind you of about three to six months. This is super important and it will give you peace of mind just by having this buffer kept to one side and available to tap into if you need it. You free up that mental energy to designate two more important things. So how do you gather this six months of buffer is through that paying yourself first. Start putting that 10% away and once you have your stockpile, then you can start using the additional money you saved to building into your investment fund and looking at investments. Number four is not knowing your income or expenses properly until you know what your starting point is. How do you know where you want to be? There's something called lifestyle inflation and that is your spending rise as your income rises. The more money you make, the more you spend and it's a cycle. Make more money by a bigger house, buy a nicer car, spend more, make more and it's crazy how normal this is but it is a recipe for disaster. You want to be in control of your finances and mapping out where things are going. A budget tracker is super important and you want it to include how much you're making, how much you're paying yourself first. That 10% we spoke about your expenses, so your bills, your mortgage, your rent, your spending, your debt repayments and so on and you want to be keeping on top of that budget tracker. At least every three months, set a date night with the tracker. People who know exactly where they are financially, they know their assets, they know their liabilities, they have a clear goal on where they want to go financially and all the steps they need to take to get there are more likely to get a lot of money and build wealth compared to people who just fantasise about money but have no idea how to go about it, how they plan to acquire it or how to manage it. Just being mindful of this stuff and seeing those numbers in black and white will trigger you into action. Fifth bad money habit is having expensive hobbies. A lot of people like to shop and I guess yeah, part of this is retail therapy but again, marketing, social media and these multi-billion pound organizations love to tell us how much we need to spend our money and spend our cash instead of keeping and investing it. Next up we have focusing purely on saving. If you want to improve your financial position, you can firstly save more of your existing income or you can make more money and create more income streams and the ideal combination is a mixture of both. You can't build wealth if you're making more money and spending it all but you also can't if you're just focusing on the saving side because there is a cap to how much you can save. Using those cash back sites will only get you so far. So to truly build wealth, you have to think of both sides of the equation, both how you will save a larger percentage of your income but also how you will make more money. Saving money side has a cap, the making money side does not. It's infinite. There is unlimited potential upside, whether it's investing in the stock market, asking for a pay rise, starting a side hustle, you want to break the bad money habit of thinking that saving money is going to massively increase your wealth. Number seven, paying too much in taxes. Taxes are going to be the single biggest expense in your life. Whilst everyone has to pay tax, a lot of people just pay it without considering how you can legally reduce your bill legally is the key word to. The wealthy, they have knowledge of illegal corporate structures that come with tax advantages. They hire tax advisors that help them minimize their tax bills. So if you want to get one step ahead, one of the best ways to increase your wealth is to understanding tax rules in a way that stack up in your favor. For example, investing through an ISA or a Roth IRA, which is an investment account that shelters your dividend and profit from taxes or operating under a business instead of an individual if you're a solar printer. All of this stuff is absolutely legal and if you are someone who disagrees with this and prefers to pay more taxes regardless of whether or not you can reduce it legally, then it doesn't hurt to understand the tax rules and reduce that tax bill so that you can instead use the money to give back to things that directly align with your values instead of letting someone else decide where that money should be going. If you want me to make a video on tax, I was planning to. I already have a summary on why I want to include but I have been a bit skeptical about whether to release this. It's a topic that can go either way. So let me know in the comments below if you want to see that. Number eight, waiting too long to invest. When you start having savings, you have that stockpile, that buffer that we spoke about. Then you want to start looking at investing that money so that your money starts working for you and you want to diversify those investments. So you can weather different situations that come around in life but you want to avoid leaving that money in a bank account because inflation is a thing and it means that you're essentially losing money every year. So I have a mixture of safe investments of riskier investments that I'm willing to lose as well. Start looking at different investment strategies once you've saved up enough. Don't leave any additional money more than you need to in a bank account. I have another video and what you can be doing with your money in times like the current recession and I'll link that here for you as well. There's always going to be reasons why you can't invest because you don't have time. You don't have enough money. You don't know where to start but the longer you pit off investing, the harder you will have to work to get that same level of financial freedom as someone who starts investing earlier. I just be finding the right person or the right tools that help you resonate with your finances in a way that most appeals to you whether that's through an employee perspective or an entrepreneur perspective. Someone who is a less of a risk taker, someone who is more of a risk taker but there will be someone who kind of matches your investing style more closely. Thank you so much for watching.

in this video I'm going to give you the three storytelling techniques to move your stories from this to this let's go first take me start right into the action the biggest difference between great storytelles and beginner storytellers is that they bring us into the story from moment one they don't waste any time giving too much context they start their story right into the action you can do that by pretty much having your character do anything any type of action that can be walking biking reading you name it for example it's May 2019 dinuka steps into his manager's office and hands in the letter or about two weeks back I was on my bike singing out loud on Dancing Queen by ABBA do you see do you see what I did there by starting your story with forward momentum with these actions you immediately bring in your listeners into the story all right on to the next one if you master that skill you'll be in that top one percent of great storytellers second take look show don't tell the best stories they're emotional everyone agrees on that but what most people do is when they share a story they tell us how the character felt they use words like happy sad disappointed nervous well this is a great starting point we can do better than that let me give you two examples instead of saying my boss was very pleased say my boss woke up to me patted me on my back and looked at me with this big grin on his face or um instead of saying I was nervous say my legs started trembling my entire face turned red do you see the difference instead of telling the emotions you show the emotions show how the body how the face changes when you experience that emotion it's a tiny modification but it makes your story immediately more visual alright on to the last and my absolute favorite storytelling technique third technique use dialogue the best stories transport the listeners into the story's World your listeners should see the story in their heads they should feel the emotions they should experience the story as if it was happening to them now one of the most powerful techniques to do that is to use dialogue or the exact words that were used in that crucial moment of the story let me give you some examples instead of saying my mom was very disappointed say my mom looked at me and said Philip you're a disgrace or instead of instead of saying well my my client secured three millions of funding see my client called me and said crazy we did it we secured the three millions of funding thank you so much do you see the difference it's a small tweak in the wording but it makes a massive difference to how visual it is look these three story time techniques will help you spice up your story big time but you also may want to make sure that you include a few of these unexpected or surprise moments in your story to know exactly when to include them you may want to check out this next video in that video I shared my three lessons that I got from reading these 34 books on storytelling see you there,non-well-being
" Hello there, guys! Are you dreaming of starting your own business, but you're worrying about your capital good news? You don't need to have a huge capital to start your own business, so if you are interested, you got to listen to this video that will make you wealthy and debt free! Hi there, this is Shinkitan, your world coach. I'm very happy to be tuning in. So, let's start our bucket of business, start your own business, and then start your own business. Also, we're going to talk about the pitfalls, and then finally, I'm going to share with you some tips and success that I personally have used and done that I started my business without any capital. So, if you are interested in starting your own business without capital, the best start-up is to start your business from home. If you are interested in buying a Chinese, I'm not sure, but I'm not sure. Oh, no, you're not sure about buying a farm? In Chinese, if you are interested, the business model of our ground floor is the second floor. If you notice that from Benondo, on Ong Pin, there's a ground floor in the second floor, just in case you don't have a vental, you don't have to buy a house. And you can't buy a house. That's number one. The most important thing is that you can work around your schedule, work at a farm home for over 12 to 13 years already. And then, of course, as I'm from that, when you're on a vacation, you don't have to be on a transportation fee. You don't have to be on a vacation for a long time. Guys, if you just know what I'm trying to say, you would understand what I mean. So, that's number one. If you want to go to a business home base, but that's the only thing. That's the only thing. I'm just widening. Wining, before I talk about you, what are the potentials that you can get into? Number one, what are the things that you can buy in your home base business? Number one is overworking. The problem that you're working from home, that is, you don't know what you're doing and what you're doing. It's very important as you start working from home. You just need to be able to get your mindset. Let's say, 8 to 5, 9 to 5, after 5 o'clock. No, you stop. You don't have to be on time. So, that's number one. There's a tendency of overworking. And there's also a tendency that also overworking from home base or underworking. When you say underworking, since comfortable, you can use 11 to 12. And then, you can use Netflix if you're working on content. You don't know what you're doing. You're just being honest. So, there are two sides of the coin. Either you overwork or you underwork. So, again, it's all about building routine, building habit and building discipline in order for you to succeed when you want to work from home. So, right now, let's talk about opportunities. Opportunities that we're seeing. Number one, what are the best things that you can get into? You want to start home base or without a doubt, go into sailing. Sailing like for example, real estate insurance. They're going to direct sailing. Because, you know, the first thing that you need to do is to get a wife. And, you need to get a wife. You need to get an immediate income when you want to start your own home base business. Maybe you're asking why. Because the goal you need to get into your encounter, you need to get an opportunity. It's not to earn money, but to earn and gain experience. To earn and gain confidence. Listen. Listen. So, what do you need to do? The money will follow if you learn how to sell. Because, you know, we want to invent something. But, imagine this. Sailing is a new skill that you have to acquire unless you're looking for a woman. Because, imagine what you were trained to become an accountant. You were trained to become an engineer. Or, probably, you were trained to become a nurse. And, all of a sudden, switched profession. So, I'll go to sales in zero knowledge, zero experience, zero exposure. So, you need to give yourself at least six months to one year. Six months to one year to learn. To learn not to earn. Anyway, the thing you need to do is to get your job. Do this as your part-time and sideline inside the hustle. That's number one. Number two. If you're going to get a job, you can say, she's going to get a face-to-face. And, I'm going to say face-to-face selling is the online selling. We've been planning to sell online. She's going to shop. She's going to take the Facebook Marketplace. But, you can get a product and start promoting it online. And, the good thing about the online selling, of course, is that, overhead, social media, posting, not just the market, but open 24-7. Not just that. So, a third opportunity, guys, you can get a free-lancing. I'm sure, if you're looking for a marketing, a graphic design, social media management, or ads, you can get a lot of things online and offer free-lancing services online. I think you need to get a job. You need to get a job. You need to get a job. You need to get a job. You need to get a job. You need to get an organization. You need to get an opportunity. Or, if that, another opportunity online tutorial services. You can get a free-lancing virtual assistant. You need an administrator, a secretary, assistant, and a schedule. So, if you're looking for an opportunity, and you're looking for an opportunity, maybe right now you're asking, okay, I'm solving the idea. I like all your ideas, but how do I start? Okay, so if you want to start this, what you need to do? Number one, identify your strength and capability. In your own way, that's where we all start. If you're looking for an opportunity, I have the gift of some taking something that's very complicated and make it very simple for people to understand. I have a gift. I have a problem, right? I have a problem. I have a problem. I have a problem. I have a problem. So, if you want to be part of my coaching group, I give also group coaching and one-on-one coaching session. If you want to have time with me, especially if you're a business owner, a major confuse, can you go ahead and do it? All you need to do is just go to chinkfree.com, CHINK, frie.com, and you can also get the link to own group coaching or personal coaching. Just fill up the form. So, number one, I identify where you're good at. Number two, identify your target market. See how many target market you want to help. And then, of course, you'll get a problem with the pain point, and the solution you can offer. So, let me know. The problem, the pain point, and the solution you can offer. And then from there, you create already your product and services that you want to offer. That's where you start. Simple. What do you think? What you're good at, target market, is that after that problem, pain point solution, after that, you create the product to be able to help your target market. That's it, pancit. And then, of course, some of you are saying, chinky, you're going to get a job, but you're going to get a job. Because we don't know how long it will take to get a job. Well, if you found this video helpful, and you want to do the needy-gritty session, on how I can help you to start to launch or to grow your business. So, let me go out and stage yourself.

" The number one reason that students don't get upgrades is because they don't study. Obviously, but the number one reason that students don't study is because studying just takes too long and I still remember despising school and hoping that my teachers wouldn't announce a new test. Because if they announced a new test, that would mean more studying. And studying meant having to sit down on the weekends and spend hours upon hours doing something that I didn't want to do. It felt so boring, tedious and daunting. And you know procrastination is actually caused by this daunting feeling. So by learning how to study fast. I slowly rewrite it studying from sign-line despise and I always hated to do. So I think that would take lots of time. The sign-line has a quick and easy and simple. And since I started to be studying on that way, I ended up procrastinating less and I got better and better results. And I could have met before, I'm Steven, also known as Jigsbok, and I got this set of perfect results in my GCSEs. But the key is I was able to do this while studying little so that I had time to do all these other things. And I'm going to teach you how to do the exact same. The first way to study faster is to manage your expectations. That was a study done and there were two groups of people that were followed. One group of these people associated aging with illness. And they'd like, they'd have beliefs such as, I'm going to age so poorly, when I age my skin's going to become more like, ring please, just going to be like, diseases like bad stuff like negativity, right? Whereas one group had a more positive outlook on aging. They had a more, it is what it is like when I live my best life. And like, you know, I'm actually going to take care of myself and you know that aging's no longer going to be that bad. And the crazy part is that the group who expected to age poorly actually did. They went to look at the hospital more frequently. They literally had like a worse quality of life when they did tests like they were more parents get their diseases, they had worse skin. Whereas the group with the positive outlook, age well, and they actually did end up living their best life. Expectations are powerful. It literally has an effect on your wellbeing and health when it comes to like the aging. And so your expectations when it comes to studying can actually dictate how long it takes. And since whenever I sat down to study on those weekends, I'd always be like, oh man, I'm just going to take forever. I'm just going to take hours. I'm going to be so boring. My study sessions ended up taking hours and actually being boring. This time you sit down, use this framework, say out loud, this task or like whatever it is, so pass papers, studying, etc. This is only going to take X amounts of time. Easy. And as crazy as it sounds, when you start a task with this positive outlook and you tell us off that we'll only take like a certain amount of time. As opposed to, oh my god, this is going to take so much time, you end up finding ways to do something. Click up. You're more focused and you'll be more efficient. As David Robson said, by changing your perception, you can change the way you are. And if you're tired of just being average and school feeling tedious and you just feel like you're not making enough progress, it just all starts with a change. I used to be kind of mediocre average until I made a change and that led me to get these results. But you can't get this without knowing what to change. And there's so much that you need to learn, especially if you want to study fast like I did because I needed to have the time to do all these other things that I still love. So if you want to learn how to study efficiently, you want to learn how to become a top student or aspects, get the extra curriculers, build up an impressive portfolio. It all starts with learning how to be productive, how to be efficient. And these are all things that I teach you in this free study master class. So make sure to check that out first link in the description. It's completely free. Anyway, back to the video. The second chapter is you're doing too much. Imagine your reminder and you're looking for gold. You dig and dig and dig. But most of the time you find it's just regular dust. However, in a small part of the mind, you discover a huge vein of gold. That small area is what gave you most of your wealth, right? That's the 8020 rule. In studying, there are certain concepts like gold. They're worth more than others. And you can find these gold nuggets, which isn't found everywhere. They're only found in certain areas. And when you focus your study time on those areas, you're going to end up getting so much more better results. You don't have to take everywhere to find treasure. You need to focus on the right spots. The main reason that studying takes a lot of time is because she spent time studying everything. But let me tell you something. Let me make this a rule. From now on, you should only be spending time studying areas that are your weak points or areas that will be tested heavily in exams. Suddenly, you're not having to spend time on your strong points because that's the most fun part of the revision because you're going to get all this stuff, right? You've got to not actually learn anything new. And when your revise, you need to study the areas that will come up in the exams. And so when you study heavy weights topics in the exams, you know you can bag yourself the most marks. And this 8020 rule can also be applied in the context of how you study. During your study sessions, 20% of what you do actually gives you 80% of the results. And then the remaining 80% of that really actually gives you 20% of the results. And so it makes sense to only focus on 20%. Especially when we're trying to study fast. The way to find out what parts of your study session are the most important is to ask this one question. If I only had two hours a week to study for whatever subject that you're trying to study for, what would it look like? It may seem like a ludicrish and it might seem like a ludicrish and it might seem like a ludicrously short amount of time since you might be used to multiple hour long study sessions per day. But once you answer yourself this question, you naturally categorise the most important and non-important parts of your study sessions. For me, before I optimise my study sessions, it would contain a lot of relearning. I'd reread textbooks, I reread notes and then I'd review and then finally I'd test. If I had only two hours a week to study for that subject, I'd focus on just doing past papers because actually getting familiar with the exam structure and getting to know what kind of questions might come up is far more valuable than actually relearning because you're not trying to relearn everything when it comes to exam. It's called revising for a reason. It's not relearning. And the common thing that a lot of students say when I advocate for you to do past papers is I can't just do past papers, so I'm not actually learning anything. But studies prove that you actually learn most through your mistakes. And so when you do papers and you get stuff wrong and you review the mistakes, that's more of an efficient learning than all the other study techniques put together. It's not study or revision if you're not making mistakes and so you should focus your time on that. And the third tip is to put a timer on. This is a kind of a unique tip, but try timing your study sessions when you do them. There's many reasons for this. Firstly, when you have a time in front of you, you're acutely aware of how much time is spending on the study session. And so you see that if you've been studying for like an hour already, you know how much time has elapsed and you know if you need to speed up or slow down. Also, studies actually prove that when you're time doing something, humans are just naturally inclined to try and get it done in the least amount of time possible. That's why speed runs exist, right? And also when you have a time run, you can also start to set targets. I want to get this task done in one hour. And when one hour passes, you know if you've been efficient or not. And that's why when you climb mountains, there's checkpoints by like an hour 14, you want to get to the checkpoint 8, checkpoint beat. And imagine instead of that, you just said you wanted to get to the top of mountain by four days time. During those four days, you wouldn't know if your pace is correct or not. You can start to do the same with study. When I used to study poorly, I would never tell myself how long I'd be there. I just say I need to study. And so I ended up spending the whole day there 8 hours. And as we talked about, my brain started associating studies sessions to be 8 hours long, right? And so I dreaded it and that led to procrastination. But the trick is to always set the time that you're going to use to study. To be saying that's unrealistic, realistic. Parkinson's law says that your task will always fill the dedicated time that you give it. So actually, although one hour might be unrealistic, then you might think, oh my god, there's no way I can finish this in one hour. I used to think this as well, but when I actually start to play games in one hour or two hours to do the task, that normally takes 8 hours. You'd be surprised I actually found that I could get it done in that amount of time. Never underestimate efficiency, the flow state, and getting things done in the least amount of time. Don't believe me? Set up the time of your next study session, and you'll be surprised about how efficient you are. And if you like this video, you probably like learning from me.

the truth is anybody can make money online in 2024 doesn't matter your age your race or where you're located in today's video we're going to be talking specifically about different ways to make money online for different age groups so without wasting any time let's just hop into it okay so today we'll be looking at the following age groups 13 and under 14 to 17 18 to 25 and 26 and over so let's start off with the youngest group ages 13 and under at this age group you may think that it's impossible to make money online that's not really true it may be difficult to receive payment through different processors such as Shopify payments or PayPal things like that however there are a couple ways that you can make money that are a little bit unconventional one way would be to freelance thumbnails cover arts or different clips for social media creators this way doesn't require you to have you know a formalized bank account you could do this with something as simple as a cash app which I believe becomes available at ages 12 plus you may need a parent to help you sign up but you can receive payment if you don't know what freelancing thumbnails and clips and cover arst essentially that's when you find different content creators and you you know learn how to make either thumbnails or make different short form Clips or make Channel banners and art and things like that you could do that using apps such as pix art or you know uh canva or even cap cut and you can make thumbnails you can create clips and reach out to you know small to medium level creators and say hey I made you this clip hey I made you this thumbnail how do you like it I can make work like this in the future and yeah as long as you have something like a cash app to accept the payment you're good to go so now that we went over to the youngest group let's start getting into the older folks now let's talk about ages 14 to 17 at this age group you have you know a bunch more responsibilities you're able to do a lot more things I would recommend that for ages 14 to 17 your main focus should be growing an online presence now if you say Kyle I'm not the one to be you know a YouTuber or a twitch streamer you know I don't want to be in the camera I don't want to be in the spotlight that's fine there are ways for you to do so that don't require you to be in the spotlight however the most profitable way to make money in this age group would be starting your own YouTube channel Tik Tok account Instagram account and growing that I do have other videos talking about how to grow an Instagram account I have not made a video talking about how to grow on Tik Tok and YouTube yet but that will be coming soon you could of course freelance thumbnails and clips like the younger folks that can also make you a lot of money if you do it properly if you do it really nice and efficiently and very professionally and yeah at this group you are also able to start using things like Shopify if you have a parent to sign up for you so you know if you want to do things like reselling on Shopify Drop Shipping selling actual products like physical products you can do that if you have someone that can help you sign up for that account but yeah that's what you know I would say for the people ages anywhere from 14 to 17 all right so moving into the next age group we have 18 to 26 so that 26 age isn't a hard age it can be 25 it can be 28 but 27 it can be anywhere in that range but once you turn 18 you have access to way more payment processors you can use PayPal of course you can use cash app of course which you know you can use if you were younger too but you can use Shopify payments without having a parent set it up for you so the number one way to make content or you know I just leaked it the number one way to make money online I would still recommend be making your own content that is hands down the best way the most profitable way to make money on you know online in 2024 however now you are able to do Shopify Drop Shipping which is super efficient I have tons of videos posted about that click my last video it's SE it's like it's a long video but you can watch that and it talks about Drop Shipping in depth um also you can start doing remote work so that's something really cool once you you know over the ages of 18 and also you can do freelancing you know you can also do the thumbnails you can do the Clips if you want to do that as well uh they kind of Stack up so anything I mentioned in the last tier this older tier can also do the things in the Young teers but you know I'm just talk as we get older and older you have more you know availability of things you can do so this group I would emphasize doing something like Drop Shipping because it's also very profitable if you're not the person to be in the spotlight or if you're not the person to you know try to run and grow on social media totally fine Drop Shipping something like that would probably be my second recommended second most recommended you know hustle that you try out and yeah man give it a go and see how see how it ends up for you man so now we're going to move into our last a age group this is going to be people ages you know 27 plus um like I said this isn't like a super hard age group but you know if you were any of the other groups you can also do things that are in here so for people ages 27 and up I would say something like either consulting or coaching is really good if you have something that you're really good at if you have a skill you know if you have a talent you can you know consult and help people learn how to do that skill using different sites like UD Demi teachable um patreon school.com and like teach something that you're you know if you feel like you're really good at something that people would want to learn um also you can do remote jobs a lot of remote jobs like to hire people in the you know the older age groups because you know they feel like they have more life experience so you can do something like that as well you can look on sites like indeed to look for online you know uh online project management jobs remote remote corporate jobs things like that also you can do blogging blogging isn't really too popular with the younger Generations so people that are a little bit older usually do have that down packed um I would definitely check out blogging because you can get paid from having different ads and stuff on your site so that's that's definitely really cool if you want to look into that also if you're you know a little bit older that doesn't mean that you can't do anything that I mentioned before you of course can you know do content creation freelancing e-commerce you can do all of those things however these are just things that you might be a little bit more inclined to do since it requires a little bit more experience or you know just overall life experience to get into so I try to give y'all like your own sector of stuff you feel what I'm saying and that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about in this video man if you would like a more indepth video for each age group please comment down below as I mentioned if you want to learn how to you know resell products or if you want to learn how to you know grow an Instagram theme page click the links in the description go to KV courses.com I do have a course on growing Instagram theme page and I also have a course on reselling products on Shopify starting drop shiing things like that I don't want to take too much of your time up man thank you so much for watching this video it's your boy KY Wy man and I'm hey I'm I'm going catch you on the next one bro deuces,non-well-being
" Here is me trying to learn 10 times faster by doing nothing. You see, I'm currently following an approach that I've learned from the Internet's go-to expert for real productivity advice, who is none other than Stanford Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman and Andrew Huberman and Andrew Huberman. And some of his learning tips have made people say, Why has that not been incorporated into our educational system? And speaking of the education system, currently I'm in the final year of my undergrad and it's definitely been a challenge to balance all the content with everything else in life. So that's why I want to test out this popular and scientifically grounded system that Andrew Huberman talks about for learning faster. And at the end, I'll let you know which parts I found the most useful. Okay, so if someone gave you the option of learning 10 times faster, you probably wouldn't mind. Well, the way that Huberman says we can actually achieve this is through a very sophisticated process called doing nothing. Okay, so that's not entirely wrong, but the more scientific name is called the gap effect. And here's it explained by the man himself. Anytime you're learning something, it pays to have random intervals in which you stop and do nothing. Okay, so I've been trying this out recently and Huberman gives the rough number of doing around a set of these for every hour. But I felt like if I had to consciously count how many of these breaks I do, then they'll end up being more distracting than it would be useful. And at the same time, I didn't want to use any of those apps that do this for you. I think there's some out there, but that seems like it's more complicated than it needs to be. So what I ended up doing was I would just keep working, working, working until I naturally like slow down. And then I'll just take one of these 10 second breaks. And the thing is for me, and most likely you as well, is that these 10 second breaks is something we probably do unconsciously anyways. So it's not like we need to put in all this extra effort to force ourselves to take these little breaks. Now you know that staring at the window isn't always a bad thing. Now, I don't want to oversimplify things. These gap effects are just one part of the learning system that Huberman talks about. And altogether, they can help us learn much more quicker. And so the first step in this approach is get alert. And there's lots of ways of doing this, but one way Huberman recommends is taking around 25 deep breaths. Okay, on a serious note, I've been trying this out for some time now. And I don't see you think that the effects aren't that noticeable for me. Because if I'm tired, I'll just usually go for a walk or some exercise. Because I feel like that's the best way for me, at least, to become alert and actually focus on what I'm doing. But I can see how this can be helpful if it's like really late and you can't go out and exercise. So I guess it really depends on your own body clock and your own routine. The next step is get focused. Now, if anything like me, you probably know that focusing is a good thing. You'll help us learn much quicker, but it's always so hard to do. And this is exactly why I found this little trick quite useful. Huberman says pick a point in the room to stare at for around 30 to 60 seconds. He says you can blink, but try not to have any other thoughts and just try and focus on that one point until the time's up. Now, this has to be one of my favorite tips because it seems so simple this one, but it actually works really well. And this is especially right after I stare at a point and then go straight to work. It's almost as if you can carry the focus between one thing and the other. And once I'm in the zone, Huberman recommends limiting each study session to a max of 90 minutes. And this is essentially because 90 minutes is about the maximum time that we can maintain intense focus for. And for me, the goal when I sit down is to do at least 60 minutes because often lose focus. But now I know if that happens, I use it as an excuse to take one of those 10 second breaks that we mentioned before to kind of reset. Now, even after you finish studying, Huberman mentions there are things you can do to make sure you actually remember what you just learnt. And he saw me falling asleep in the intro. That wasn't just for dramatic effect. Well, it kind of was, but it was also to show you the power of NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. And this involves things like meditation or napping for around 20 minutes. But personally, I find that I don't have that much time to rest after each study session. But luckily, Huberman says that even sitting there and doing nothing for one minute, but ideally 5 to 10, can have a similar effect as well. Now, I'll be honest, it's very hard to measure how effective this is in helping me study because there's just not many quantitative ways to go about measuring it. But one thing I've been doing this with is with physical skills. So learning kicks for more time or driving a particular route. I find that after practicing these physical movements and then doing nothing, I find that this actually helps me remember them much better. So obviously, the actual sleep that you get that night contributes to this as well. But basically, for physical skills, I found this very helpful. And for mental skills like doing mouth-floor, studying. I'm going to keep testing this out and see how it works in the long run. And out of all of these steps, Huberman says that getting alert, getting focused and sleep that night are the most essential steps. But as for how you go about each one, it obviously depends on your own style and routine. And personally, for me, focusing on that one point to help me get focused and taking those 10 second breaks during my study sessions. Those are two of the things that I've done the most helpful and something that I've implemented every day now. And if you're interested in the other study secrets I'm using at the moment, you may like this next one.",non-well-being
"Hey, it's Zara. In this video, I'll be talking about neural networks. Before we dive into neural networks, let's talk about machine learning in general. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, or AI, that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. I'm sure you're hearing AI way too often these days, and you're right to think it's becoming more of a marketing term. Some even argue that John McCarthy, who coined the term in the 1950s, intended it to be a marketing term to attract funding. Anyways, unlike traditional programing, where we explicitly define the rules and logic, machine learning enables computers to learn patterns and make predictions without being explicitly programed for specific tasks. Let's illustrate this with a real world example. Spam email detection. Let's say I receive an email and I want to determine whether it's spam or not spam. With traditional programing, I would need to write specific rules. For example, if an email contains words like “lottery”, “free” or “winner”, it's classified as spam. The limitation here is that I would need to anticipate and encode every possible rule. If spammers change their wording, the program may fail to identify new spam emails. On the other hand, with machine learning, instead of writing specific rules, we feed the machine learning algorithm a large data set of emails, each labeled - in the case of supervised learning - by humans as spam or not spam. The algorithm learns patterns from this data that differentiate spam from non-spam, and during training, the algorithm will try to build a model that minimizes the classification error, or more generally, something we call a loss function. In this way, the algorithm can adapt to new forms of spam without explicit reprograming. To illustrate this, if I were to plot the data with each email representing a point on a representative components, for example, x1 could be a measure of suspicious words, and x2 could be a measure of how generic the email is. These features or components could be engineered or learned. My hope is that the emails in my data plot are something like this. Now, this is obviously an oversimplified illustration, but I think you get the general idea. The stars would represent the spam and the circles would be the non-spam. I could simply draw a hyperplane, or in this case just a line to separate or classify these emails. Remember when I said we want to build a model? Well, this hyperplane is the current simple model that defines which email is spam or not. So if I receive a new email, it could be simply plotted here to see if it is spam or not, depending on where it's located. With respect to the separating hyperplane. Since the data, or the emails in this case, used to train the model were labeled, classifying the emails goes under supervised learning, which is one of the three types of machine learning. The other two being unsupervised learning. So for example, clustering news articles into categories. And the third is reinforcement learning, such as training a car's autopilot through an algorithm that rewards for desirable actions and penalizes for undesirable actions. If you want me to discuss more of these concepts in future videos, please let me know in the comments. What is a neural network? A neural network is a computational model developed around the mid 20th century, inspired by the way biological neurons in the human brain function. At its core, a neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process data and generate outputs based on that data. The network learns from input data by adjusting the connections, known as weights and biases, between these neurons to improve predictions or classifications over training iterations or time. The complexity and depth of these networks can vary depending on the problem they are designed to solve. The key components of the neural network are the nodes, the layers, and the connections. Neurons or nodes are the basic unit of a neural network. Neurons receive inputs, apply a mathematical operation, and pass the result on to the next layer. Each neuron is connected to other neurons, forming a network. We also have layers which are broken down into three categories. The input layer, which is the first layer that receives the raw data input, such as numerical values, images, or text. Next we have the hidden layers, which are the intermediate layers where the data is transformed by the network. The number and size of these layers can vary depending on the network's design. And finally we have the output layer, which is the final layer that produces the output of the network, such as a classification label or a predicted value. And finally, the third component of the neural networks are the connections or the weights and biases. Each connection between neurons has an associate weight, which determines the strength of the signal being passed. Biases are added to each neuron to shift the activation functions. Output. And this allows for more flexibility in the learning process. Mathematically, the operation within a neuron can be represented as follows. Where wi represents the weights, xi is the input, and b is the bias, and f is the activation function that determines the neurons output. Let's talk about f. First let's look at the sum inside. None of the operations in X are non-linear. We only see linear operations. It's just like ax + b where the xi's are simply multiplied by the weights wi’s and added. That's why we use activation functions. Activation functions like the sigmoid function and the ReLU or the rectified linear unit, are commonly used to introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns in the data. The sigmoid function is often used when the output needs to be interpreted as a probability, as its range is between 0 and 1. ReLU, on the other hand, introduces non-linearity while being computationally efficient, since it involves only a simple thresholding at zero. So if z is below zero, the neuron simply does not get activated. So maybe you can already see how these networks can represent complex functions by tuning which neurons get activated and which do not given a certain input. we've covered the basics of what neural networks are and how they're structured. I understand that these concepts might seem a bit abstract right now, but in the next lecture I'll introduce different types of neural networks and provide concrete examples to help make these ideas more clear and more practical.

okay let's go into a little bit more detail about this fundamental theorem of calculus the thing that links differentiation and integration right there in two very very simple [Music] equations let's start with that definition the fundamental theorem of calculus so essentially says you have some function y that looks like this y is equal to F ofx and Y is continuous and differentiable so you can draw it without taking your pen off the page and there's no sharp corners or edges then you have this area under a curve a and fundamental theorem of calculus says that the derivative of a with respect to X is equal to Y but we also know that a is equal to the Limit as Delta X tends to zero of the sum from I = 1 up to n of Delta x * y of x i so this is the big idea you got something that links derivatives to the area underneath a curve now one thing that you need to know is that as Delta X tends to zero this [Music] sum in here this guy has a special symbol of its own it's called an integral and it looks like this a is equal to the integral of Y DX X that little DX thing there that's like a whole complete symbol it's really just illustrating that you have let a Delta X the size of your strip 10 to zero that's why that's still there it tells you what you're integrating with respect to so if we put those two things together now this one and this one these are the partnership really that's differentiation and integration working together we have da by DX is equal to y Y and the integral of Y DX is equal to a you can also write this using Newton's notation so it's essentially the same thing you can say the derivative of a function if that function is equal to something else then the integral of that something else will be equal to that function so these are saying identically the same thing some textbooks prefer this version some textbooks prefer this version but they are one and the same things they're saying exactly the same thing in fact we're going to use both of them actually as we go through and what these are both saying is that integration is the reverse process to differentiation okay so let's work through an example to see what we're actually talking about here let's imagine that you have got the example of the curve of Y = x^2 and you want to know the area between X is equal to 0 and x is equal to 1 Y is equal to x^2 and we want to know what is the area [Music] between xal 0 and X is equal to 1 so essentially we've got two options here we've got two different ways that we can calculate this we know that's the area there we know that the area you can work it out by doing this summation you can also work it out by doing the integral so let me show you both ways and show you how they end up being equivalent so you have two options here the first option is that you you could say well this area is equal to the Limit as Delta X tends to zero and actually work it out by hand of I = 1 up to n of Delta X Y of x i or option two is you could say well a this thing here is equal to the integral of Y X but we only care about this between n and one so here in this one this would be between X1 is equal to not and xn is equal to 1 and in here there's a simpler way to draw in these limits you can just say that we only care about this between not and one and put them in like that so let's try option one first but essentially what we're going to do now is we're going to take these two options and we're going to do them both and show that they end up giving you the same thing so using option one then a is the limit as Delta x ts to zero of this thing here of I = 1 up to n of Delta X now y of x i is just the function is just squaring it so we'll put that in so it's going to be x i^ 2 and this is between x i is equal to Zer and xn is equal to 1 Delta X is the width of each chop and there are going to be N Chops in total between x is0 and x is 1 so you could actually rewrite this as Delta X is equal to 1 / n and as Delta X tends to zero n is going to tend to Infinity so we can rewrite this thaning in those terms and as we do so let's just expand out this summation a little bit and have a look at what's going on here so we have got Delta X is just 1 / n and then we've got x i squar so X is just going to be equal to not X1 is going to be Delta X it's one step along Delta X which is just one over n or squared The Next Step along two hops along will be 2 over n or 2 * Delta X that's going to be squared plus the next one along will be 3 / n^ squar You're essentially just evaluating Y at each one of these steps exactly as we have before all the way up to n/ n or squared now when you have this long string actually every single one of these terms is going to have an n squ in the bottom which you can take out so this is equal to the Limit as n TS to Infinity of 1 / n cubed of 1 + 2 + 3 plus all the way up to n and each one of these terms is still going to be squared along the way in fact there is actually a formula for this thing here here you may have seen it before of course when you've been looking at uh geometric series sums of geometric and arithmetic series but this is actually equal to n + 1 * 2 n + 1 all divided 6 so this entire thing here the limit as n tends to Infinity of n + 1 2 n + 1 oh sorry it's n n + 1 n n + 1 2 n + 1 / 6 so this entire thing is equal to n n + 1 2 n + 1 all divided n cubed * 6 now as always with limits you can evaluate these so there's going to be an n in the top and an n in the bottom are going to cancel the limit of the entire thing Al together of two things multiplied by each other is the same as the limit of each of those things separately then multiply together afterwards so this is the same as 1/ 6 time the limit as n TS to Infinity of n + 1 / n if we just split up these fractions times the limit as n goes to Infinity of 2 n + 1 over n which if you have a little look at these we've got an n on the bottom and n on the top they're both the same same size so as n gets bigger and bigger and bigger these two are going to cancel each other out and this whole thing is just going to go to one likewise here You' got an n on the top and an n on the bottom and as n gets bigger and bigger and bigger these two things are going to grow at the same size so those two will cancel each other out and all you're left with is this factor of two on the top so this entire thing is going to end up having a limit of two so that means that a back at the beginning we kind of finished it now a is equal to 2 over 6 everything else in that limit just tends to 1 which is equal to 1 over 3 so that was option one that's kind of the annoyingly long way now let me show you the neat Quick Way by using integrals instead of summations so let's now try option two so for option option two we know that a is equal to the integral between not and one of Y DX we also know don't forget that d a by DX is equal to Y and we know that Y is equal to x^2 so putting these two things together essentially we know that da by DX is equal to X2 and this one here a is equal to to the integral between n and one of X2 DX so what we're saying here is that we're looking for a function a we're looking for something called a that when you differentiate it you get x s so what needs to be differentiated to give you X2 well let's try a few things let's try d by DX of x cubed well if we were differentiating that we would have 3x^2 which is nearly x s but not quite this pesky 3 is kind of getting in the way so we can try and include that in here try and cancel that out before we get to it how about we try something like X cubed over 3 we try and cancel out the three before it even arrives well if you differentiate that you do indeed get 3x^2 over 3 which is equ Al to x^2 which is what we want this is what we want so we know what you have to differentiate to give you X2 it's this thing in here and that is your answer that's what a is Da a by DX is equal to x^2 or Y so we've done it we've kind of done it it doesn't feel like you're doing it because you're just trying out a few different things until you till you spot something that fits but you are ually answering this question the thing that you need to differentiate to get X squ this thing here is X cubed over 3 that's our a so to get from the integral of X2 back to a it's just X cubed over 3 we have to evaluate this from X is equal to 0 and x is equal to 1 now we've kind of played this sort of trick before when we were going around with anti-derivatives the opposite process to differentiation we were saying what do you need to differentiate to end up with this and now we're saying the reverse of that process is if I integrate this what do I end up with it's all kind of one and the same thing so the only thing that remains now is to evaluate X at these particular limits and it just so turns out that to do that you put in the top number first inside this bracket and then take away this bracket with the second number so it's like this this is equal to X Cub over 3 at X is equal to 1 minus X Cub over 3 at x = 0 which is equal to 1 over 3 - 0 which means that a a is also equal to 1 over3 so notice there that's the value of a we got when we integrated and this right here is the value of a that we got when we went through all that fath of sorting out all of the summation so there are two things that I want you to notice about this example the first thing thing I is that they both have the same answer and thank goodness because that's kind of how we defined what an integral was in the first place but it's kind of nice and comforting to realize that that really is the case and there's nothing special about X squ here we could have picked any function at all really I just picked something nice and simple to demonstrate the ideas you could have picked anything at all and as long as you could work out this summation and as long as the integral worked they would end up giving you exactly the same answer because that is what integration actually means the second thing I want you to notice is just a little trick that we did in here of where you're evaluating an integral between two limits just to slightly formalize that for you what I was saying was that if you are taking the integral of something between A and B that is equal to F of B minus F of a where DF by DX is equal to FX just to make that super clear that's how you do it that's how you evaluate an integral at limits okay in summary I mean this is the key idea it's called the fundamental idea for a reason the fundamental idea the thing that links differentiation and integration right there in two very very simple equations there is no reason why everyone shouldn't have access to the very best education welcome to Calculus 1 to introduction to astronomy introduction to philosophy to statistics microeconomics ative let's get started [Music] ,non-well-being
"SQL is a key data skill but where do you learn it how do you learn it and what are the important topics I know it's extremely intimidating even thinking about what is the first step especially because I came from a non-technical background when I was first learning SQL but sight now that I've been using SQL for many years as a data professional I know the more efficient and easier way to learn SQL and I will walk you through the exact steps that I would take if I'm learning SQL today first off let me get started with what is SQL SQL stands for structured query language and it allows you to interact with data for example with this statement of Select * from table where number is greater than five this is just saying give me all the data from the table where the numbers are greater than five so it's very much like simple English and it's something that I really believe you can pick up without a computer science background now why should you learn SQL can't AI do it yes AI can code but SQL is still very much a required skill set on many job listings including data analyst data scientist data engineer project manager so if you're interested in any of these job titles SQL is a skill that you should start learning in fact according to stack overflow survey from last year SQL Remains the third most used programming language across professional developers and employers value not just your ability to use SQL but your ability to use it to be able to draw insights to make business decisions as Reddit user mamertine best puts it I'm not paid because I can write SQL I'm paid because I can understand data employers are looking for you to not just use SQL but your ability to critically think about data and learning SQL will help you start doing this now that we know SQL is fundamental how would I learn it these are the three steps that I would take step one choose an environment SQL is used within a specific environment called database management system dbms and each dbms has its own flavor of SQL according to stack Overflow survey where over 90,000 professional developers responded they said that the three most commonly used dbms's are postgresSQL mySQL SQLlight and I'll make sure I include the links to these descriptions below so that you can start downloading them now what's the difference between these three and which one should you choose on the list well it really doesn't matter I would say the syntax is very similar across all three and they are all open source and free to download so I wouldn't be too concerned about which one to choose because you really can't go wrong but in my experience I've used postgresSQL and Microsoft SQL server and I really did not have any trouble transitioning between them so I would just say pick one and then move on to step two I'll also mention that if you don't prefer to download any software onto your laptop there are always cloud databases as an option which are on AWS Google cloud and Microsoft Azure they have limited free options as well so check that out step two learn the basics quickly in this step I am not going to try to memorize all the syntax or learn all of it as much as possible because there is a lot of SQL syntaxes and nobody memorizes them what I do want to focus on is learning the fundamentals and by fundamentals I mean what is a database what is a relational database what is SQL and what is its uses then I want to focus on the SQL syntax and structure this includes some of the statements like earlier select from where as well as the crud operations which stands for create read update and delete and how am I going to learn this well SQL is best learned by doing and research shows that when you passively learn you only retain about 20% of it whereas Active Learning allows you to retain about 75% to 90% of the information Interactive Learning is really important when learning SQL and that's why I chose the wrong way to learn SQL is by memorizing all the syntax this this will only teach you how to query the data but not actually understand it how I would start learning SQL in context is to start with a familiar small dataset like my credit card statement with about 20 to 30 rows of data I'll then analyze it and try to answer questions like what is my spending habit and that will teach me how to load data how to create a data table and then be able to order my data set and start doing a lot of what a data analyst would do and start writing my own queries and as I do this these are the topics I would progress from beginner to advanced SQL so how much SQL should you know the answer really depends on what your role is if you're a project manager a beginner level SQL is enough to be self-sufficient and be able to do your own queries and gather your own data but if you're looking for a more data heavy like a data analyst or a data scientist but more junior I would say a beginner to intermediate level is enough and that is about the level that a technical interview will be for SQL and then for advanced SQL I would say that's really for more senior level data roles as well as data Engineers who are more heavy on the data infrastructure side my tip for learning SQL goal is to continue practicing it in context because this will solidify your knowledge as well as give you the  confidence in your abilities there's a concept called curve of forgetting which relates to the idea of how we retain information on day one we remember about 100% of what we learned but on day 30 we only remember about 2% to 3% however when we expose ourselves to the same information daily whether it be 10 minutes minutes even 2 to 4 minutes as time progresses we tend to get  closer to the 100% mark of what we retain and this concept very much applies to learning SQL it's not a skill that you can learn in a day but it is a skill that as you practice you will get good at it and you will retain it so have the confidence and continue to practice your SQL skills if

thank you so much and I will see you on the next one",non-well-being
what's going on everybody welcome back to another video today we're gonna be taking a look at the differences between a database a data warehouse and a data lake only ever heard of a database and i think that's what most people are familiar with but i had never heard of a data warehouse or a data lake and so in this video we're gonna be walking through the differences between each one of them as well as how they kind of connect with one another so let's jump onto my screen and get started all right so we're gonna be taking a look at a database a data warehouse and a data lake but let's start with a database now when someone says a database typically they're referring to a relational database now a relational database can capture and store data via an oltp process which stands for online transactional process so when company completes a transaction and sells an item it'll record that within a database and that data has the ability to be live real-time data data in a database is going to be stored in tables which has columns and rows and this will be highly detailed which means you're going to be able to go in and see every single aspect of the data and databases also have a really flexible schema which means you can go in there and kind of change things as you go to make it work for what you need now a data warehouse is also a database just like we were looking at before but it's going to be used for analytical processing or olap olap stands for online analytical processing and it's created to basically analyze huge amounts of data now if you notice on the last slide there were these three databases they were just kind of sitting there and they were storing the data in this visualization that we have on the right these three databases on the bottom are all aggregating and sending their data to this data warehouse via an etl process which is where it extracts the data it transforms it and loads it exactly how they need it in this data warehouse and that's how data is put into the data warehouse it isn't getting it directly from the source but it's being put into a database and via the etl process is being updated as it goes or whenever the etl process runs a data warehouse will always have the historical data but it won't always have the current data unless the etl process is running every single day or very frequently the data in the data warehouse is also a little bit different because we're doing this etl process to get the data in there we're not actually putting every single piece of data or every column and row in there we're typically summarizing it and then putting it in there which will allow us to process that data for our analytical purposes much faster now a data warehouse is going to have a much more rigid schema so you really need to plan ahead with how you're going to put your data into a data warehouse it's not as flexible as just a database so now let's look at some of the key differences between a database and a data warehouse a database is going to be used for recording transactions or a data warehouse is going to be used for analytics and reporting a database is going to have fresh and detailed data where a data warehouse is going to have summarized data it's only going to be as fresh as the etl process is created a database is going to be a little bit slower for querying large amounts of data and when you do query large amounts of data it can actually slow down the processing of all those transactions a data warehouse was designed for the exact opposite it was designed to be very fast at querying and not slow down any processes because it isn't part of that transaction processing at all so now that we've looked at a database and a data warehouse let's take a look at a data lake a data lake was basically designed to capture any type of data that you could possibly want it could be a video a picture an image a document a graph anything you could imagine that you'd want to put in a database or store in some way you can store it in a data lake now there are a ton of use cases for a data lake but i think people who work with machine learning and ai get to use it or benefit from it the most they can use all that structured and unstructured data and create models to really use it in its raw form where if you want to use it for analytical purposes typically you're gonna have to clean it up a little bit and do a little bit more work to actually make it usable and so a dale lake is just that it's this lake where you can basically throw any type of data in there but it's not always super usable because you're just putting it in there in its raw form if you want to use it for analytical purposes and reporting most of the time you're going to want to clean that up and put it into a database or a data warehouse so now when we're looking at all three they are all different and they're all used for different purposes so no one option is better than another for your data if you're using it just to record transactions a database is what you should do and if you have a large amount of data that's just too much for your database to handle it sounds like you might need a data warehouse and if you have all this data they have no idea what to do with or it's unstructured semi-structured data that you can't fit into a database well then i highly recommend using a data lake there really is no one size fits all all three of these can be options for different uses and in fact you can use all three within one company for just different things that your company needs so i hope that that was helpful learning the differences between a database a day warehouse and a data lake again i had really never used a data warehouse or a data lake when i first got into analytics but now that i've gotten hands-on experience with all of them they're all really interesting can be used for so many different things so thank you so much for watching this video i really appreciate it if you like this video be sure to like and subscribe below and i'll see you next video [Music] ,non-well-being
"wrote something surprising. Zarathustra—a sage who is also the central character of the book—tells his followers to stop following him. He says, “I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it. I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathustra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.” This is one of my favourite parts of the book. I found it surprising, but interesting, that the sage would tell his followers to be ashamed of him, abandon him, and mistrust him. Why would he do that? As usual, I’m gonna explore this idea through a dialogue. ---A young student (S) spent years searching for enlightenment. He travelled across many countries and lived among various groups of ascetics, but after searching for years, he found his quest to be fruitless. Finally, he gave up and decided to work on a farm. The farmer (F) he worked with was a simple man. He didn’t talk much, but when he did, he enjoyed a good philosophical debate with the student. At first, the student was open to debate, doubting much of what the farmer said, thinking he was similar to the other ascetics the student had met in the past. But after some time, the young student sensed an immense wisdom and tranquility inside the farmer. He started to agree with the farmer more and more. The students desire for enlightenment had returned, and so the student worked with the farmer for months, absorbing his knowledge. Eventually, the farmer noticed that the student had stopped debating with him, and the following conversation ensued. F: I think it’s time for you to leave me. S: Leave? Why? F: Listen, when you first arrived here, we had many things to teach one another. We grew together and learned from each other. Your mind was inquisitive. But recently, you’ve begun to believe everything I say. You’ve gone from an inquirer to a believer, and I won’t let you do that to yourself or to me. We’re both better off if you leave. S: But I came seeking the truth, and I found it in you. F: The truth! You’re lost kid. S: Why would you send me away like this? How can you do that to me? F: Let me show you something. Take a look at this map. What do you see? S: I see our farm, the river nearby, and the mountains. F: No, you see /an image/ of our farm, the river nearby, and the mountains—not the things themselves. Now tell me, what can you learn from this map? S: I can learn where the farm and the river are, the height of the mountain, where the berry trees are, where we plant our carrots… F: No you can’t. Give it a few millennia. The river will dry up, the mountains will move, and this farm may be a city. You can’t learn anything about the farmas it is, you can only see an image of it as it was at some point in time. See, a man’s memory is like this map. It can capture a shadow of reality, and he can share that with you, but he can never give you the reality itself. A man can give you his memories of the truth, but he can never give you the truth itself. He can tell you where the farm was, but you’d still have to verify it for yourself. If you want the truth as you say, there can be no intermediaries, no middlemen. If there’s a middleman, then he is the one you are following, not the truth. S: But what’s wrong with following you? F: If you follow me, you’ll live according to /my/ memories. You’ll live according to /my/ map, and you’ll never learn to construct your own. What if my map is wrong? Then you’ll be lost with me, and you won’t be able to correct me because you never learned to navigate on your own. And if you can’t correct me, then we’re no longer able to help each other. But if you learn to see for yourself, if you learn to construct your own map of reality, then we can come together as friends and individuals. We can compare our maps and help one another see reality as it really is. And when we both see reality as it is, we can journey through it together, as equals. S: I guess you’re right. I’ll start packing my things. --- In a letter to his sister, Nietzsche wrote, “if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire.” And in my opinion, Zarathustra tells his followers to leave him because they are still believers. He wants them to become inquirers. He doesn’t want followers. He doesn’t want people to believe what he says. He wants them to doubt him, inquire, verify what he says for themselves, and see if they arrive at the same vision of reality. And if they arrive at the same vision of reality, then they can be travellers in this world together. They can be equals. But if they simply believe what he says, then they become followers. Followers learn to follow someone else’s map, and by doing so, they lose a direct connection to reality. And if they lose a direct connection to reality, we all lose the value that comes from their own unique perspective. We lose the value of independent verification and the possibility of someone correcting us. But inquirers, on the other hand, make their own maps and maintain their connection to reality. And because of this, they bring us actual value through their unique perspective of the world. But at the end of the day, this is just my opinion and understanding of Nietzsche’s words, not advice. Feel free to use this information however you like, and if you have a different take on Nietzsche’s words, I’d love to hear your perspective in",non-well-being
" People are making thousands of dollars in passive income every month selling products that don't even exist until someone places an order. $34,000 per month. The realistic earnings have been able to make with printout demand. About over $1,000,000. $63,000. $1,000 per month. Multiple six figures in profit. $1,000 per month. But is this actually a realistic side hustle impossible for anyone to do? Well, as an experienced millionaire businessman, I'm going to put this to the test myself by making and selling my own print-on-demand product. As this is a side hustle challenge, I'm setting myself for usual rules. Rule one, I must sell under a fake name. Rule two, I can't spend more than $0. And rule three, I must launch the business within 24 hours. Start the timer! The first thing on my plan is to find a supplier with easy to use software. For anyone who doesn't know how print-on-demand works, here's a very quick breakdown. You make a design and partner with a company and in return they print and ship your product when someone buys it. This means if we execute everything correctly, then all we have to do is click the paycheck. So I'm just going to make a free account with Gelato as they seem to have fulfillment centers all around the world. And from what I can see, have the most straightforward software for me to use. Right, so now we need to decide what kind of product we want to sell. There are lots of different products perfect for print-on-demand, such as T-shirts, mugs and bags, but instead of just guessing, I'm going to do some market research to find out what's actually selling well. I like to use TikTok for this kind of thing as lots of people are using it to promote their print-on-demand stores because they have an integrated shop feature. You've probably seen the little banner that pops up at the bottom of some TikToks, giving you the option to buy what's in the video. Honestly, my son's girlfriend has bought so much on TikTok shop. I'm not just looking for one-off videos, I want to find out account that consistently sells the same product. If someone is investing their time in creating multiple videos, it's safe to assume that the product is selling well. Right, I think I've found the perfect product. Wall art. First, based on what I've seen on TikTok, there's a large market of aspiring entrepreneurs who love putting motivational artwork on their walls to keep themselves motivated and working hard. Secondly, Wall art is very cheap to make, but it seems from my research that I can sell it for a high price as it's more than impulse purchase. This means that my profit margins will be very good as I'll make more money per sell. And thirdly, there are so many different ways I can scale this business. Just think if I grew it big enough, I could even branch out into premium artwork. Look, wealthy people can hang in their mansions. Imagine how much I could sell those for, but I'm getting a bit ahead of myself here. First, we need to make some designs. Right, I've got a confession to make and I'm not proud of it. As you know, I'm under a time limit here and I don't really have enough hours left to make my own designs and do everything else on my list. If I was a bit younger, then I could probably use an AI tool like mid-journey to create the wall art for me. But you guys know I'm a boomer, so it would take me a little while to get the hang of it. And time isn't something I have lots of right now. That doesn't mean I'm about to die by the way. So long story short, I've ordered five different wall art designs from three different sellers on Fiver. I sent them all this brief. I would like you to create an entrepreneurial poster that can be framed and used as wall art. Please come up with your own quote, idea and theme. I think something entrepreneurial or motivational would be best. I intend on using the poster size 30 by 40 centimeters. That's 12 inches by 16 inches for all our American viewers. I look forward to seeing the design. This is going to be pretty interesting as I really don't have time to make any changes and I'm kind of leaving my fate in their hands. While we're waiting for those designs to come back, let's use this opportunity to make an online store. I've decided I'm going to sell on Etsy as it's relatively simple and has a low barrier to entry. Platforms like this are great as they already have an established customer base for you to tap into. The downside is that it's often erased at the bottom as your product is nothing but a commodity and it's only compared on price. Although my designs are unique, there are still a lot of people selling similar products. If you want to build a business that stands the test of time, I suggest heading over to something I Shopify and creating your own store. So it's the next morning and I've been sent some designs to review. I haven't looked at them yet so let's look at them together. Actually, I quite like this one. The design looks pretty cool and the quote is very true. I'll tell you what, if I had a penny for every time someone said my success was due to luck and not hard work, then I'd be rich. Oh wait, I am. This next guy seems to have made five different designs. Let's take a look. Honestly, these designs do look pretty basic and the quotes are just stating the obvious. The only one I really like is the last one and even that looks like something I could have done in two minutes. Okay, so it's all riding on this last seller. This is actually my favourite design so far. This next one I'm not so keen on but I can see is at least try to play with the text a little bit. Maybe this will appeal to the girls is it's got that sort of swirly font. I think they like that sort of thing. Right, now we've got to upload these designs onto gelato. Since this is a print on demand product, I don't have to pay for anything until a sale is made. So this is great if you're starting out with zero dollars. So I'm just going to go to the menu on the left hand side and select product catalogue. As you can see, there are a lot of different options here but I'm of course going to select wall art. So this pulls up a selection of different types of posters. Now I'm going to pick wooden framed posters. I'm then going to go with the premium matte paper option as I can see that this is the best seller. And to be honest, I don't think people are really be able to tell the difference between this and the museum quality one but my profits certainly will. So I'm going to select 30 by 40 centimetres as I think this is the best size poster for most houses. And it seems to be the size most people select. Then I'm going to pick vertical and a black frame color as that's pretty sort of gender neutral and ready to hang because not assembled. Hey, nobody get time for this! I'm just going to repeat the steps with all my designs, including the ones I didn't like. After all, I've got nothing to lose and who knows, I might even sell some. Now I've got all the designs uploaded. I'm going to go over to the menu and select stores. This is where you can link your gelato account with your Etsy store. If you don't want to sell on Etsy, as you can see, there are lots of different options. Right, I could just upload the designs from Fiber right onto my Etsy listing but to be honest, they don't look very premium. So I'm going to use the built-in mock-up studio by clicking here. This tour will help me bring the posters to life. First, we just have to set the dimensions for our file size. Oh, they have actually on here an Etsy preset. So I'm going to just select that. But you can also set custom sizes if you'd like to create mock-ups for things like Instagram stories. Now we need to select a scene for our mock-up. Oh, now that one looks good, so let's go with that. You can zoom in and move around a scene by just double-clicking on it. So I'm going to adjust it to make the scene a little bit bigger, so there's more focus on my poster design. Next, let's select our poster size. I'm going to set it to 30 by 40, as I said before, most poster designs are this size. These are looking pretty good. Now, the last step before we can sell our wall art, setting a price. I've just taken a quick look at the price navigator tool, and in here, it lays out exactly what the product costs. How much shipping will set us back and even the total profit per sell. Looking at all of this, I think a good price would be $49.99. This is a bit high compared to most competitors on Etsy, which will definitely impact sales. But I'm willing to take a bit of a risk, because I always think a nice profit margin is around 50%. Right, so I'm over in Miami on business, but I've been keeping an eye on our side hustle challenge. And I'll tell you what, I've got some results. But before I share them with you, check this out. I actually ordered a couple of our products and got them shipped to me over here in the USA. And I think that's pretty good. And the quality as well is absolutely fantastic. I think I'm going to keep these. Actually, I'm really impressed with the shipping time, as well. It took three days to get these tools, which is far better than to try these drop shippers. And that should give us an advantage. I'd actually always recommend ordering your product before you start selling it, because reputation is everything. And you don't want customers speaking negatively about your product. So I've left it just a few more days, because things were going nicely. Now for the moment you've all been waiting for, did we make any sales? Well, yes and no. Some of the posters generated a few sales, and some didn't even catch your bite. Overall, we generated 11 sales, which led to £549.89. But of course, this isn't all profit. First, we had to pay for designs on Fiverr, which was £60.77. Then it's, he'd take a small cut of 6.5% on each cell, which came to £35.74. And let's not forget the product and shipping cost, which came to £371.69. By the way, as I used gelato a lot in this video, I reached out to them and asked them if they could give you guys some kind of discount on these fees. They agreed. So with the link in the description, you can get 50% off your first order. With all those expenses deducted, it leaves us with a grand total of £81.69. Considering that I accomplished all the setup within 24 hours and now have the designs, I'd consider this a success. This means I can continue selling these products over the next few weeks with minimal additional expenses. If you guys would be interested in seeing a part two where I allow myself more time to revamp the business and see how far I can take it, let me know in the comments. If you want to know how to sell blank books on Amazon, then I'm going to leave that video right up there. But don't click on it, just yet. Make sure to subscribe if you want to grow your wealth. Okay, I'll see you over there.",non-well-being
" For people who have been around for a while, you might be seeing the title and thinking, Chaden, aren't you allergic to cats? And to that, I'd say, yes. Kind of. I'm actually not sure anymore. And for the people who know anything about me, you might see the title and think, Chaden, cats are literally the number one natural predator to birds. And to that, I also say, yes. That one's 100% broom-backed. So let me back up a bit and explain how we got here, because all the cards in the world were stacked against the idea of me getting a cat. Growing up, I was irrefutably and absolutely allergic to cats. My best friend had like three of the things, and every time I would hang out or sleep over at her house, I would be a sneezey, watery-eyed, snotty mess. Can I have some water? Given the fact my brother was also allergic to cats, it was set that we were a dog family. My whole life I went around not giving cats a second thought. I never had anything actually against them, but since I was forced to stay 20 feet away from them or suffer the consequences, I just couldn't get to know them. Plus, as a kid, dogs were always more appealing. They're more likely to be bigger fans of playing and running around, be more approachable with their genetically bred, unconditional love, and can overall be more forgiving. Cut to like two cat-less decades for me later, and I'm meeting Jacob for the first time at his place. As we're hanging out in his living room, his cat Frazier comes over and greets me. Frazier is extremely social and vain, so he's always expecting nothing less than a never-ending stream of attention from the people. Even though he's very cute and distinguished, I deployed my typical foolproof plan of don't touch the cat. Frazier realizes he's not getting any attention out of me and sits down nearby on the couch. But a bit later, Jacob's other cat ends up making an appearance. This one's Taylor, she's normally really shy and hides, but does really like women, which I am. Taylor ended up crawling onto me and making herself really comfy in my womanly lap. Jacob, knowing I'm allergic, offered to take her away, but this was actually the first time a cat has ever done something like this to me. I've always been a bit of a cat magnet if you want to call it that, because I act like they don't exist, which they interpret as me not pushing their boundaries and creating a comfortable environment for them to come up to me on their own terms. But never have I felt like a cat has chosen me like this before. I told Jacob I'm happy to let her stay comfortable on me, and I'll just reap the consequences of my sewing later on. This was my first extremely positive experience with the cat, and I honestly felt really happy and special and wanted to enjoy it. A few hours later, I'm saying my goodbyes, and during the drive back home, I realized I was completely fine. No sneezing, no itchy eyes, straight up nothing. I was so confused and curious. Thus, the start of my little cat experiment began. Every time I went over to Jacob's place, I would let the cats be as social as they wanted with me. If Taylor wanted to sit by me, I'd let her. If Frazier wanted attention, I would pet him. At one point, while we were watching a movie, Taylor literally decided to lay down on my neck, feeling everyone of my breaths with cat dander and hair. And you know what happened? No reaction! Not even a little drip of mucus. Somehow, sometime, I'd grown out of my cat allergy and never noticed. Apparently, every seven years, people's allergies have the chance to change. Maybe being surrounded by my friend's cats all throughout my childhood could have helped my body get more familiar with them. Either way, I've now unlocked the skill to survive cats. Oh guys, it was incredible. Now that I'd been freed from my shackles, I immediately started taking time to get to know cats more. Instantly, they felt so much more cute and cool and approachable and aww, it was so hard. I was really starting to like them more, especially since every time I would hang out at Jacob's place, Taylor would walk over and be around me and purr, and... Oh, it was amazing to be loved by a cat! So, I really like cats now. And after some time, I decided I wanted one too. Jacob and I decided to peruse a local cat rescue website just to see what cats were available. I don't want to get one right away, there's a lot of have going on, but it doesn't hurt. Oh my god, that one! I want that one so bad, it's so cute. What's this name? Toast out of Toast out of Toast out of my beloved! We have to send in an application, we have to! Hi, my name's Jayden, I love this cat. Please let me adopt it. Please, please, please. What? You guys know me, I'm week-willed and impulsive. My first mistake was liking cats to begin with. The rescue reached out a few days later for a cat screening interview to make sure we would be a good fit to be cat parents. After being approved, they told us we could pick any cat we wanted that was in their care. Of course, I asked about Toastada, but we were given the unfortunate news that she had already been adopted. Nooo! We looked at the other cats available on the website, but unfortunately none of them really stood out to me. The rescue ended up inviting us to a little meet the cats event, they were hosting where we could see all the cats they had up for adoption in person. Which was awesome because that was actually the first time I'd ever actually seen and held a kitten before. It was amazing, but as cute and tiny as they all were, there still wasn't one that called to me. I pride Jacob away from the kittens, headed home, and we started waiting. Every day I would check the rescue's cat list to see if any new ones caught my eye. I didn't even know what I was looking for, but waited for the universe to send me my perfect cat nonetheless. One morning I refreshed the page and saw one new kitten added. A tourty they found in some dumpster named Scrabble. With the biggest eyes and forehead I'd seen in my life. Something about this bizarre little creature called to me. I messaged the rescue about Scrabble and they told me she's available, putting me in touch with Scrabble's foster parents. Every day they sent me new little pictures of kitten Scrabble and every photo I felt more and more in love with her. She seemed so silly and playful and those eyes. We got on a video call and they told me all about how big of a personality she has. Out of the five other kittens they were fostering, she was by far their favorite. The whole time we were talking Scrabble was flipping around in their arms and looking at the camera with her giant orbs. I left that call knowing I found my cat. I needed to have little kitten Scrabble, meeting her in person only cemented it. She was shy at first but after flinging around her worm toy she immediately started hopping around and being the life of the party. I talked a lot to her foster parents and they just gushed about how they wish they could keep her since they all loved her so much. Even though the rescue called her Scrabble, obviously that was more of a placeholder name. The foster parents called her Kami but neither of those really fit to me. However, I knew one name that I liked. I stole another kitten's name and paced it on mine. So what? Big Dale! Toastada is a great name! My Toastada is way more of a Toastada than the other Toastada anyway. Look at her. I would have left with little Toastada in my arms that moment if I could. But unfortunately Jacob and I were going out of town for 3 million weeks and had to wait to take her home until after we came back. She was all I could think about the entire time. I was shoving Toastada photos in everyone's face every chance I got. The foster parents were sending Toastada updates every day. I was overflowing with yearning for this cat. She was growing and learning about the world without me. Take me home to my child. Literally the moment Jacob and I landed we drove straight from the airport to the foster home to pick her up. I could not wait. We arrived home with plus one Toastada. I couldn't believe it. I have a mammal now. I'm sorry other mammal owners, but it's the best mammal in the whole wide universe. Jacob and I spent the entire day playing with her letting her get used to her new surroundings. She was so cute and so tiny. Here's a video of her eating wet food with a big ol' chomp. As someone who's owned birds for 7 years at that point, it felt so strange to have a pet that was significantly less fragile. And also draw significantly less blood. You mean this thing can't fly up and get hit by the ceiling fan? Insane! I've had Toastada for a while now. She's two years old at the time of me posting this. And let me tell you, this thing has become a creature. First of all, eyes still giant. And she never blinks. Look at this. She was sitting on my desk looking like that long enough for me to notice. Get my phone out of my pocket. Pull up the camera app. Put the camera in her face and take a photo. And here's like four more. Also, not that smart. I'm sure you can deduce that by how she looks. But this thing has a single brain cell and it's just another version of herself up there with a joystick. Jacob and I are fully convinced she can only form a few thoughts today and only in single word nouns. Evidently, Toastada is also very scared of everything. Always has been. Loud noises, quiet noises, no noises, movement of any kind. Even Jacob, a person she's been around all her little life post dumpster. There's been times where he'll be at his desk, moves his chair just a smidge, and she's darting out of the room. One time we were trying to explain to some friend's house skittish she genuinely can be, and demonstrated it by grabbing a toy literally in front of her, raising it up a bit, lightly dropping it on the floor, still in front of her, and she bolted. You know how cats are genetically built to be good at balancing? Well Toastada can't even do that. She trips and falls and misplaces her feet all the time. On multiple occasions she has tried to walk across my L-shaped desk and just mist and fell down. That's like the one thing that makes a cat a cat, and nope, doesn't hit the mark there either. She's gotten better, but as a kitten Toastada couldn't even jump. After I built her her first cat tower, I watched as she attempted to jump up to the second level, not quite make it, and had to slam her arms down on the thing to hoist herself up like she was mountain climbing. But always she the sweetest little thing. When I got a cat, I was expecting it to want its own space, come around when it wants, you know, general cat things. But this creature follows me from room to room with those high beams of her. She sits on my lap while I'm at my computer, lays on my giant Pokemon blushes, mostly just looks up at me from the floor and just stares. When I'm sleeping she'll just crawl into bed and tuck herself up right next to me. Look at all these photos of her straight up on me when I'm sleeping. Don't look too close so I don't have makeup on. Bedtime is sacred to her. She loves bedtime. If I'm working late, Toastada will come into my office around 9 or 10pm. AKA past Toastada bedtime and just start crying, scratching on my chair, rolling around on the floor. It's pitiful. And if I still don't move after that, she'll go into the bedroom and drag over her string toy she always plays with. It's just so sad and pathetic. I always play string with her when she brings it over though. Don't worry. But lately she's picked up another routine habit, which is pets. Not all cats like the pets, but Toastada lives off them. It's when you just slap a cat's butt and it looks like you're hurting them, but they actually love it. However, Toastada's really particular about pets. First of all, I'm the only one allowed to give her pets. Jacob is tried and she runs away scared and offended every single time. Second, she has to receive pets on a specific spot on the floor of the closet. If I try to give her pets in like my office, she bolts to her floor spot, staring at me to continue them over there. Also, she begs to be pet every single night. Like clockwork, she'll sit like a gargoyle in front of the closet and cry pitifully until I come over there. Now when I finally come over for pets, she'll flop on the floor and start horizontally rock climbing her way across the floor with her claws and tangle herself up in the ethernet cables while I keep up the pets. You think I'm joking, but I'm very much not. This is the only way she accepts pets. And I have to give them to her every night or else she's miserable. Toastada's world is so small. She's really just around me, Jacob Taylor and Frazier, but she loves her simple family so much. When kitten Toastada first met Frazier, she was terrified of him. She'd been around other adult cats before, but she'd never seen a flat cat in her life and she was mortified. Of course, she's since warmed up to him and they play together and hang out all the time, their best friends. But Toastada loves Taylor. Always has. She looks up to Taylor like a little baby sister admiring her cool, awesome older sibling. Unfortunately, Taylor hates it. They literally have a SpongeBob Squidward type of sibling relationship. And Toastada is so oblivious to it. Taylor has annoyingly swatted at Toastada so many times just for existing around her that Toastada now thinks it's a fun little game they play and will start chasing and swatting back at Taylor happily, not understanding cat social cues. Of course, never in a way that's too far, but just enough to get on Taylor's nerves even more. Between the three of them, they all have such different little personalities and relationships to each other. It's made our lives so much more entertaining. And to anyone concerned about the birds, don't worry. I've got Ari and Toast who are very separated from the cats. They're safe in their own blocked-off room connected by a double door system that ensures no possible interaction between bird and cat. If anyone is thinking about getting cats and birds as pets, it is possible, but just make sure that two are very separate. Especially if you have smaller birds like conures or budgies. I'm sure there's people out there that have trained their cats to be fine around a pet bird. But to me, all it takes is one accident or attack for you to just not have a bird anymore. Plus, having the two of them takes a huge amount of time and commitment. I've said it before and I'll say it forever. I love my birds to death, but they do not make good pets for the very large majority of people. In terms of allergies, I do think I was originally still a little bit allergic to Toastata, ironically. When I first got her, I was sneezing and sniffling. Nothing allergy pills couldn't fix. And it never was as bad as my original cat allergy. But I think I've been growing out of that one too, because nowadays I don't have any reaction to her at all. These are a mystery. I am building my immunity to everything. Next up is Rat poison. I didn't think I would make a video talking about this thing, but Toastata has just got such a funny little personality and has become such a big part of my life. She may be the description of autism, but I love her more than the world itself, and I know I'm the center of her little life too. I don't even see her as a cat. She's just a little creature that follows me around looking weird, but I love it. And I'm so glad I grew out of my cat allergy just so I can have her. It really has been so different owning a cat, mainly because I know Toastata won't just bite me at any given chance, unlike some avian creatures. Thanks for watching the video. Heads up. I'm going to be announcing new merch again soon. So be on the lookout for that. The last drop went so well, and I'm really glad that so many of you guys enjoyed it. I'm so excited to finally be getting back into making fun merch. And it really helps me out a lot. Alright, sorry. Thanks. Anyway, I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye.",non-well-being
" Here's a little social interaction life hack I've discovered. If you're meeting someone new and you want to get to know them better and you see any semblance of a tattoo peaking out of their sleeve, compliment it. If that person doesn't want to talk about their tattoos, they'll say, oh, thank you! Anyway, this is my stop, but if they do want to talk about their tattoos, their face will light up and then they'll do the rest of the talking. I realize that by giving you this advice, now anytime I compliment someone else's tattoos, it will seem disingenuous, but it's not. Most of the time. I love all of your tattoos. That's right, I'm talking to you. I love your tattoos, dude. Whether it's how you got the tattoo, the meaning behind the tattoo, or being a tattoo of something you like, every tattoo is a story, and most people love telling stories about themselves. I wouldn't know anything about that, personally. I never understood why some people liked talking about their tattoos until I got one of my own. What, you think I'm going to make a whole video about tattoos when I didn't even have any? That's right, I'm a marked man, mom. What are you going to do about it? Stop unconditionally loving me? Yeah, right. Wait, what are you doing with that cheese grater? Okay, but in all seriousness, can you make sure grandma doesn't see this video, mom? I don't want to upset her on the way out. Back in the day, tattoos used to be a symbol of rebellion and meant she couldn't get a job. No regards, baby. But I feel like tattoos are getting more and more accepted, if not expected. I'll see a jacked bald guy covered in tattoos and think, okay, yeah, he was meant to look like that. For me, the idea of being a badass tattooed guy with a sketch pad and a beanie and ripped jeans and a beaded bracelet always seemed cool to me. But like most people, when it came to tattoos, I had reservations. Ooh, this is going to be on my body forever. What if I hate it? I had an idea once of getting these five magic the gathering symbols tattooed on my forearm. I even dotted them out in sharpie ones just to give them a test drive. But I ultimately decided not to get them because I was worried in five years I would go, oh, these? I was really into magic the gathering in my 20s. Not anymore, though. So now every morning I wake up with impending feelings of shame and remorse that I even decided to get this thing. And I didn't want that to happen, even though I've been playing magic for over 15 years and it means a lot to me and I'm going to be buried with my sliver deck. And, all right, maybe I should just get it. Even though people know that tattoos are permanent, there are still way more bad tattoos than there should be. One time I saw this picture of someone's tattoo on a bad tattoo subreddit and I thought it'd be funny to prank my family group chat by photoshopping that tattoo onto my arm. And then I thought it'd be funny to post that picture onto Instagram. I didn't think anyone would fall for this poor excuse of a Photoshop job, but then the internet and my family proved me wrong. Immediately, I started getting phone calls for my parents and even my book agent rang me up and was like, did you actually get that tattoo? No, it's not a real tattoo. I mean, it is a real tattoo, but it's on someone else's body. That's their cross to bear. I can only imagine what that person's family and book agent went through. My parents were not supportive of me getting tattoos. But who's are, am I right? Some people, like my parents, say that your body is like a temple. And getting tattoos is like putting graffiti on it. Which, sure, okay, that's why I paid a professional graffiti artist to paint my temple exactly how I wanted. Also, you can't tell me not to deform my body when that's exactly what you did before I was even 24 hours old. Also, Jesus had piercings and he loves showing them off to his buddies. So I think you'd be chill with a little tattoo. After much thought and deliberation, I finally settled on what my first tattoo would be. This was going to be permanently inked onto my body for the rest of my life. I got a tattoo tattoo in Coriour, New. Luckily, the artist was able to finish this in one session. It took quite a while, almost five whole minutes. Now, let me explain why I got it. It was so that if anyone ever asked me, do you have any tattoos? I could go, why? Yes, I do. And then roll up my sleeve and then I'd go, ha, ha, ha. When I showed off my tattoo tattoo on Jaden's streamathon, there was one comment that said, James having tattoo actually tattooed onto him is exactly the kind of tattoo I expected James to have. And that made me feel really good because that meant the tattoo fit my vibe. And the second reason I got the tattoo was because I wanted to rebel. Since tattoos were frowned upon growing up, I wanted to have one just to have one. So I got a tattoo with no meaning whatsoever, which in a way is the meaning. Even though the tattoo tattoo was small and usually covered up by my sleeve, I still felt anxious about getting it. And I continued to feel that way for about a week after I got it. It was a jump scare every time I saw it in the mirror, and I would look at it closely and go, yep, that's really in there. I sure hope I don't regret this. But then after some time, the tattoo tattoo just became a part of me. Like, I didn't look in the mirror and go, yep, there's James and tattoo, I would go, yep, there's James. Full stop. And from that day on, I loved giving people advice on tattoos. As a marked man myself, I think you should absolutely get that shadow the hedgehog full back piece. Yolo, remember? What? You're worried that it's going to look bad when you're 70? Yeah, it's going to look bad when you're 70. You're 70. Don't think about how bad it's going to look. Think about how much you're going to enjoy it from now to when you're 69. I've known people my age who still hide their tattoos from their parents, but like the honest prodigal son that I am, I wasn't going to be doing that. But the next time I visited my parents, I walked into their house, and the very first thing my mom said to me was, do you have any tattoos? She beat me to the punch. What? Why would you ask that? Because last night, I had a dream that you came home and were covered in tattoos. So which one of you accepted my mom? God? I said, are all tattoos bad? Yes, all of them are bad. Even this one, and I rolled up my sleeve and revealed my massive tattoo. And her reaction was, well, it's not the worst word to have permanently inked on your body. Later on, she said, if you go to a Star Wars party, you could change it to Tattooine. So I think she took it pretty goodly. Now, some of you might be thinking that my epic sleeve of a tattoo isn't that big a deal. It's tiny and can only be seen if I'm swimming or boxing or wearing a tank top. But you see, after getting tattooed, tattooed, I experienced what people in the Tattooing business call, catching the bug. After seeing how much I liked my first tattoo and knowing that I could handle having a tattoo, I was ready to get something bad as... I set up a big boy tattoo appointment with an artist I liked. And when I was in the tattoo shop, the artist asked, is this your first tattoo? Is this my first tattoo? No, sweetheart. I think I know a thing or two about tattoos. So without further ado, I would like to debut this out of the blue Tattooine. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! You know from the dark crystal that Jim Henson 80s puppet movie that I did a video on a year ago. Now I have the best character permanently inked onto my skin forever and ever. That movie will always hold the special place in my heart and now it'll hold a special place under my skin. And now whenever I show someone the Chamberlain, we end up talking about the dark crystal, which is great because that's what I wanted to talk about anyways. I think I just discovered an autistic conversational cheek code. When I was getting it done, the artist asked me if there were any other tattoos that I wanted to get and I said, why, yes, I do. I wanted to get the computer from Don't Hug Me I'm Scared because I also love that series and because I'm a computer-y guy. And I didn't realize until as I was explaining it to the artist that both of these characters are puppets. So I don't know what that says about my psyche. I never thought that I liked puppets that much, but if anyone wants to psychoanalyze me in the comments, that'd be great. And speaking of YouTube comments, I know a lot of people are going to bring this up, so I'm just going to address it right now. You've probably noticed that Chamberlain isn't holding his iconic triangle scepter. Yeah, I already know that. That's because he's holding the Emperor scepter. It's like my own little head cannon. You got to be the Emperor because he's cool and awesome. Come on, dark crystal fans. You think I don't know my lore? I didn't get the wrong scepter or anything. You think I'd get something wrong about the dark crystal? Okay, you want to know what happened? I own a Chamberlain statue because, of course, I do. And I took pictures of it to send as a reference image to the artist and I totally forgot that I accidentally broke off his triangle scepter. And now because of that, he's holding an entirely different scepter on the tattoo. But you know what? I don't care. This one's better. It's a more clear silhouette. Now, this time when I went to show my parents the tattoo, I don't know exactly what I was hoping for, but I wanted to see some dramatic pearl clutching. You know, just some real disappointment. Chamberlain had to be split up into two sessions and I only got one done when I went to Arizona for a wedding. I saw my mom and she didn't immediately ask me if I had any more tattoos. God didn't tattle on me this time. I told her, mom, I gotta tell you something. Privately, what is it? I need you to keep a secret from grandma. Okay, I'm serious. Grandma can't find out about this. Okay, look, it's Chamberlain and I showed her the unfinished tattoo and she went, oh, do you even like the dark crystal that much? I mean, yeah, the plot's kind of mid, but it's a cool world. Why were you more upset about my fake baby Yoda tattoo than my real dark crystal tattoo? She didn't care and either did my dad. And you know what? I actually showed my grandma too and she liked it. I can't make these people mad no matter what I do. One of my cousins is a tattoo artist and I was talking to him about tattoos and my mom said, oh, you should get your cousin to finish it. And even he said, do not do that. Speaking of tattoo advice, if you're thinking about getting a tattoo, I think you should wait. Obviously, it's your body, your choice, but with the minimum age of tattoos being 18 and in some states 16 with parents permission, I just can't imagine being happy with any tattoos 16-year-old James could think of. All I'm saying is that I'm glad I waited and gave myself time to really know if this is what I wanted. And it was. I know you're young and you want to look as hardcore as possible, but you can still get a tattoo when you're like 23 and it'll look good. Trust me, no matter what tattoo you get, it's a way to express outwardly to the world what you like, what you want to remember, and who you are. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm about to get a full back piece of my grandma's face. There's literally no way my family wouldn't love that. Thank you all for watching this YouTube video and now that you're all done, I'm excited to announce that I have a Funko pop of me. If that's something you're interested in, then you can head on over to my website and you can get a signed Funko while supplies last. As always, thank you to my amazing team and the next time I'll see you, I might have more tattoos, who knows.",non-well-being
" Ellen's trying to make a comeback with her new stand-up special, although its reviews have mostly been terrible. She spends most of the special responding to her being kicked out of showbiz, which began when someone posted just one single tweet. Right now we all need a little kindness. You know, like Ellen DeGeneres always talks about. She's also notoriously one of the meanest people alive. Respond to this with the most insane stories you've heard about Ellen being mean. The tweet posted in March 2020 received bad enough replies to begin Ellen's downfall. I worked at Real Food Daily, served her impotior of brunch. She wrote a letter to the owner and complained about my chip nail polish, not that it was on her plate, but just that it was on my hand. I worked till closing the night before, and this was the next mourn. Almost got me fired. The nail polish story was so unbelievable. The person who wrote it went on Inside Edition. This former waitress claim she was threatened with a two week suspension after Ellen DeGeneres complained about of all things her chip fingernail polish. I remember it as being like, really? But the story shared back on Twitter were only getting worse. I once worked at Warner Brothers. One day I was in the elevator and Ellen and her entourage came in. Naturally, I held it for her and asked her what floor she was getting on. Her assistant answered third floor. 30 minutes later I got a call from my boss, saying I was fired because I was harassing her. An old friend worked on her a lot and smiled and said good afternoon to her one day and she became unhinged. Who do you think you are? You don't look at me Yardiyarda. She said Portia was with her and seemed embarrassed and tried to calm her down. Has forever changed my opinion of her. The responses went on and on and on, all of which being compared to Ellen's classic catchphrase. I always end each show by saying be kind to one another. Audience member Donna DeMateo then went public with her degrading experience on the show. They tell you, you know, you can't be smarter, funnier than Ellen. She's the comedian and the star, not you. Don't be funnier than Ellen. That's gonna be hard considering she's not that funny to begin with. If you've been a comedian your whole life and you're afraid a random audience member will upstage you, maybe you're just not funny. Dana then revealed that Ellen's completely different when the cameras turn off. How does the Ellen we see on TV compared to the Ellen you saw when the cameras stopped rolling? Totally different. She would only speak to the audience when the cameras were rolling. As soon as they turned the cameras off, she would not even acknowledge the audience. She would just sit on the couch basically, which was supported by Heter Muscat, one of the show's former producers. Toxic phony hypocrite liar. That's what she is. She agreed that things were different when the cameras weren't rolling. We were told from the very beginning, don't talk to Ellen. Don't do this. You can't, you know, go into her office. It was very nerve wracking, very stressful. We all walked on egg shells all the time. And after the show's DJ also said the same, Buzzfeed launched their own investigation, interviewing a further 11 former employees. They were fired after taking medical leave or bereavement days to attend family funerals. One employee who claims she was fed up with comments about her race, essentially walked off the job. Others said they were also instructed by their direct managers to not speak to degenerates if they saw her around the office. After the accusations went viral, Ellen issued a statement within the company. Hey everybody, it's Ellen. On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that the Ellen degenerate show would be a place of happiness. No one would ever raise their voice and everyone would be treated with respect. Obviously something changed and I'm disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I'm sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it's the opposite of what I believed and what I hoped for our show where yet Ellen's former producer certainly didn't buy it. So when Ellen says she's not aware of this environment, you don't think that rings true. It's a lie. Ellen then took a two month break and began a brand new season by addressing the public. As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show. I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected. We have made the necessary changes and today we are starting a new chapter. She'd then make the promise and I'm committed to making this the best season that we have ever had. Although the ratings set the opposite because only six months later than New York Times published, Ellen DeGeneres loses one million viewers after apologies for toxic workplace. It explained that Ellen had been averaging 1.5 million viewers over the last six months down from 2.6 million in the same period last year. The show's loss of more than a million viewers translates to a 43% decline representing a steeper drop than any of its competitors. As a result, Ellen made the announcement, I am announcing that next season season 19 is going to be my last season. Adding in the Hollywood Reporter, as great as this show is, and as fun as it is, it's just not a challenge anymore. I need something new to challenge me with her being exposed also clearly having an impact. She'd state the expose destroyed me honestly. I'd be lying if I said it didn't and it makes me really sad that there's so much joy out there from negativity. It's a culture now where there are just mean people, and it's so foreign to me that people get joy out of that. These mean people responded stating, even without the controversy, the show hasn't been fun and genuine for years. It may have never been, but at least it seemed like it. But Ellen is tired of it all, and she's lousy at hiding it now. No more dancing by her, no monologue half the time, bad jokes that are dragged out way too long, tons of old show clips, tons of self promotion, and a guest host every Friday. These elements led to an average final season, which Ellen concluded by crying with her audience. She then mentioned the possibility of returning to acting, but instead made a documentary titled, Saving the Gorillas Ellen's Next Adventure. It released in 2023, but with only 100 reviews on IMDB, and this likely being the first time you've heard of it, it's safe to say it performed pretty poorly. Ellen rather went back to living a quiet life, until April 2024, when she'd make a new announcement. You may have heard that I'm doing stand-up again. If you want to come see me, I'll be sharing some news tomorrow at noon, as suggested she'd announce a stand-up tour, to be recorded and posted by Netflix. Also adding, yes, I'm going to talk about it, referring to her being cancelled. Titled, For Your Approval, This Special begins with Ellen walking up a flight of stairs, each referencing a headline that ruined her reputation. She acknowledges the tweet that started her downfall, as well as the employees who spoke out against her, then begins the actual show with a joke about her fall from Grace. You know, I used to say that I didn't care what other people thought of me, and I realized now looking back, I said that at the height of my popularity. I'm here because I love doing stand-up, I'm misdoing stand-up, and I like making people happy, and I do care what people think. Now, this is a pretty respectable angle, as it feels extremely honest. Yet it also seems like a sneaky request for pity, which as a high-profile celebrity, you'll simply never get. She then talks about what she's been up to. Alright, well let me catch up on what's been going on with me since you saw me last. Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. Then makes some pretty funny jokes about her new reputation. Everybody heard that it was mean, everywhere I go, I know everyone's heard that I'm mean. I know when I walk into a restaurant, people are watching, waiting to see if I'll be mean. Oh look, she's reaching for butter. I thought she was going to hit somebody. On the contrary, there are some pretty out-of-touch segments. For example, her joking about her car features, which she'd clearly only find in a luxury vehicle. She also makes this out-of-touch joke. We're all interested in different things. We're all good at different things. I was talking to someone the other day and they said, Ellen, I don't know how you get on stage in front of people. I could never do that. And I said, well, I don't know how you dry clean clothes. But as an overall, the special isn't terrible. Its audience rating of 5.4 stars feels fairly accurate, although as you might expect simply because it's Ellen, the articles written about it have been pretty brutal. Ellen did generous, unfunny Netflix special, leaves so much on-sad. Ellen did generous lets herself off the hook in self-indulgent Netflix special. Ellen did generous is unapologetic, unrelated and totally insufferable in her new Netflix special. That right, the problem with for-your-approval aside from the fact that it's almost never funny is that it feels so disingenuous so calculated to rehabilitate an image and preserve that triumph for prosperity. Another article stated it's one of the weirder stand-up shows in recent memory. Half-observational punchlines, half-closing argument in a trial, featuring degenerus as her own defense attorney, neither half works on its own, taken as a whole, it's an exhausting mess. That also adds, self-awareness is different from taking responsibility. Degenerus offers no apologies or even explanations for her behavior, yet in other more favourable reviews, unapologetic was used as a positive. I like the fact that she's rather unapologetic. It's highly refreshing and honest. This extreme divide can be seen by the audience reviews on Google. There's almost an equal amount of one and five-star ratings. A sad representation of the black and white thinking that plagues the internet so heavily today.",non-well-being
overwhelming and straight up confusing here's your guide to starting in the gym and doing your best to stay consistent let's start off with something that's personal to you your goals in the gym we can go down so many different parts be it CrossFit powerlifting or even my forte bodybuilding whatever your goals you should develop a general idea of what it is you want to achieve in the gym this will ensure that you're happy in the gym doing what you love and something that you really should know that your goals may change over time the gym you choose should be environment that you're comfortable with un fortunately there should be a lot of options available from commercial gyms to various included private gyms to even the most hardcore gyms you need to visit a gym that you feel comfortably in and just check it out most commercial gyms offer a tour or 3-day pass to check them out now that you have these two things under the belt let's get you prepared for the gym if you have no history in the gym what I would suggest is doing some research online or watch some YouTube videos of others working out it may seem a little bit weird but it's a great way for you to develop an understanding of the different machines and it's also a great way to see the different movements this brings me on to the next step of preparation developing your workout routine or split now again this is going to entirely depend on your goals and my forte is bodybuilding so we're going to use bodybuilding as a reference for most beginners I suggest starting on a lower and upper split now you're probably wondering what that means it essentially means you're going to be dividing the days you're working out by either upper or lower body and here's some examples examples of it now this usually works very well for beginners but if it's not enough The Next Step I suggest is PPL which means Push Pull legs all synergestic muscle groups are work together meaning on push days when you train your chest your shoulders are activated with your triceps and you work your shoulders your chest and triceps are activated as well this is a great way to develop good mind muscle connection which helps with strength muscle growth and a good understanding of your body here are some examples of PPL now that you got your plan let's talk about your first day depending on how anxious you feel about working out around others I'd suggest go at a time with you feel comfortable gyms are generally less busy around 10: to 2:00 p.m. and from 7:00 p.m. to closing time so now you're at the gym doing your first exercises don't worry about what weight you use even if you put it on the lightest weight and simply just feel how the machines feel and you can do this for however how long you need until you feel comfortable now when you're ready increase the weight slightly then go for around 10 to 12 Reps for four sets each do this for each and every exercise and then you can move on reps meaning the amount of times you do a single movement of an exercise sets being the number of times that you do the group of repetitions now there's a few things I want you to remember on day one the gym is a place we should all feel comfortable all the people in the gym have been in the same position that you are just starting out and they understand what it feels to be in that position if you feel more comfortable being in the gym with someone else it's a great way to start out too speak to a friend colleague or family member and see if they're willing to start on this journey with you so sometimes going by now when you're moving forward in your journey now you're probably asking how do I stay motivated how do I keep going to the gym even if I don't feel like it one thing you have to remember is that the gym is a lifestyle change it's a slow and beautiful process that you should enjoy remind yourself of why you're doing this it's a time for you to focus on yourself but nonetheless establishing the gym into your routine is a great way to stay consistent go every day at the same time and even on the days you don't feel like it give yourself the opportunity and still go even if you don't give 100% something is still better than nothing that consistency is going to make it easier over time and ingrain it into your lifestyle the gym will truly change your life and if you feel this video helped,non-well-being

city you have if you control the longest road you receive two points and the largest army gives you two as well finally some development cards are worth victory points to set up shuffle the land hexes and evenly distribute them on the table in the shape of a hexagon next place the water ports around the board every other hex making sure the numbers point towards the longest series of land tiles fill in the gaps with blank water hexes next starting at the corner of the board place the numbered tokens on this terrain hexes in alphabetical order proceeding counterclockwise towards the center skipping the desert place the robber token on the desert separate the five different types of resource cards brick or wool lumber and grain and place them face up on the table shuffle the development cards in place facedown on the table everyone chooses a color and takes the corresponding pieces roll dice the highest number goes first players take one turn placing one settlement on any available hex intersection and one adjoining road settlements may not be placed adjacent to another settlement after each player has placed one settlement and road then starting with the last player and going in reverse order players place one more settlement and one more adjoining road after you play your second settlement and road take one resource card for each resource that that settlement is touching the desert and water do not produce resources once every player has placed their second starting settlement and road then the game begins with the starting player and continues clockwise until there is a winner on your turn before you can buy or trade you must roll both dice then based on what number is rolled the corresponding resource hex that has that number produces its resource to all players who have a settlement or city touching that hex you receive one of the resources of that hex for every settlement touching it and you receive 2 of the resource of that hex for every city touching it there is no hand size limit however if any player including you rolls a 7 then any player with more than 7 cards must discard half of them down additionally whoever rolled the seven must move the robber to a different terrain Dex the robber may not be returned to the desert nor shall it be moved to a water hex whichever hex you choose place the robber covering the number on that hex showing that the terrain cannot produce resources when that number is rolled when the robber is moved if any other player has a city or settlement touching the affected hex you must pick one card at random from one of their hands and steal it you then continue your turn as normal after you roll dice and collect resources or move the robber you are allowed to trade with other players or the bank and/or buy things only the player whose turn it is can initialize a trade and you can only trade with other players who have resources you cannot gift resources a trade with a player is whatever you agree on but you cannot trade development cards and like resources both players have to agree on the trade additionally on your turn you may trade with the bank for of one resource for one of any other if you own a settlement or city that is touching a port on your turn you are allowed to trade with that port specifics three-two-one ports allow you to trade three of one resource for one of any other two to one ports allow you to trade two of one very specific resource as indicated by that port for one of any other you don't have to trade if you don't want to you may also buy during your turn pay the bank the proper resources and you can buy roads settlement cities and development cards roads cost one brick and one wood and must be placed between two hexes connecting to one of your existing pieces so long as a road isn't already present if you have the longest continuous road and it is greater than five pieces then you take possession of the longest Road card no matter who has it the longest road is worth two victory points a settlement must be placed on an available intersection connecting to one of your roads no settlement may be adjacent to another settlement or city you may only upgrade one of your existing settlements into a city remove that settlement and replace it with the city anytime during your turn even before you roll you may play a development card you may not use the development card the turn you purchased it you may only play one development card per turn unless it is a victory point then you may reveal as many as you have to allow you to win all the cards say what they do the most common card is the soldier the soldier allows you to move the robber to another space when you play a soldier it plays in front of you and stays there for the rest of the game when it is played in X just like you roll the 7 except it does not affect the number of cards in player's hands if you have the most soldiers in play and that number is greater than 3 then you take control of the largest army card which is worth two victory points if you cannot buy or trade or you choose not to your turn ends and the next player clockwise goes play continues until one person has ten or more victory points on their turn then that player is the winner,non-well-being
War Thunder is a very very bad game to get into there are basically no useful tutorials the UI is cluttered to an insane extend there's too many nations to pick from the economy's terrible and the grind long here are 10 tips that I wish I knew before starting the game tip number One never and I mean never buy silver lines of golden eagles I know it looks like a good deal you get 1.3 million silver lines for 3000 GE and is a total beginner that might seem enticing but please get a premium vehicle instead they are much longer lasting Investments and give you back much more in terms of civil lines and research in the grand scheme of the War Thunder grind 1.3 million is not a lot also don't buy research points with Gold Eagles for the exact same reasons tip number two Don't Buy Low tier premium Vehicles unless you are a big fan of this specific vehicle or plan on playing this VR range a lot there is no point in buying low tier premiums since they are low tiers they give pretty terrible rewards compared to Mid and high tier premiums and they can't really help you grind through the tree sure Rank 2 Premium will allow you to grind faster for rank 1 to 3 but that is actually the easiest part of the grind for some tech trees the entirety of their ranked one and two research is only as much as a single high tier vehicle save up your GE to buy something of a higher rank so it actually helps you tip number three before you buy those High tier premiums watch some tutorials about mechanics of higher tier gameplay a lot of the mechanics you need for high tier plane or tank are explained nowhere and oftentimes don't even have the keybind setup one example of this is radar controls for High T aircraft or thermocytes and Laser rangefinders for tanks you will have a hard time adjusting to the more modern types of vehicles don't make it even harder on yourself by not being prepared tip number four just don't play Naval I mean do I even need to explain this one unless you use a premium boat for Save Alliance farming just play literally anything else watching a 10 hour YouTube video of white noise is probably more interesting tip number five wait for sales before buying Premium Time generally it's a great idea to always wait for the regular sales before buying anything even vehicles but I can understand that people don't want to wait one year until the new height premium is on sale but for premium time you should always wait for a sale a 50 off sale for one year or even 180 days is a great discount and easily lasts you until the next sale tip number six don't buy anything in-game if you're using steam for War Thunder if you only use War Thunder's launcher it's fine but if you're using the steam version like me you are potentially losing unnecessary money when buying certain things in War Thunder this is because steam asks for a certain amount of every purchase you make in games that are offered on Steam and Gaijin decided that it is the best idea to give this extra cost directly to their customers as an example the biggest Golden Eagle pack costs 165 bucks in the steam version while it only costs 114 in their Standalone version you can get around this by simply buying golden eagles and other things on gaijin's website where even steam users will get a fair pricing tip number seven always level up your cruise after a long session of grinding I sometimes have thousands of crew experience points that I forgot to invest this is literally kneecapping your performance as these screws can give you big bony to things like reload speed tour Traverse speed crew survivability and tank repair speed don't forget to do this on a regular basis tip number eight joining a squadron is necessary if you want to unlock certain Vehicles without spending real world money it is important that you do this as early in your War Thunder career as possible if you need to find a good Squadron join my Discord ask me directly to make space for you in my personal Squadron it's very active so you can be sure to earn those Squadron research points the link to my Discord is in the video description and in the pinned comment tip number nine stay informed about events you can earn quite powerful and relatively high-ranking vehicles that are in the regular summer and winter events and they will cost nothing to unlock if you don't want to keep them you can oftentimes sell them for Gaijin coin on the market which can be spent to get golden eagles or other event Vehicles this is an easy way to quickly get access to high-ranking Vehicles tip number 10 use your boosters oftentimes when I get a silver line or research point booster I tend to forget about them and miss out on earning more rewards for free many people are also hesitant to use their boosters in fear of Performing bad in the next game and the booster going to waste in my opinion Don don't be scared and just always use them even if you activate a booster and perform bad in the next game over the span of many days and many boosters it will eventually average out don't worry about those few bad times as the saying goes you win some you lose some that's it for today's video and thank you for watching,non-well-being
" hello summoners and welcome back to another pro guys video my name is saskio and today we'll be going over the abilities of the newest league champion vexx as always anything on the pbe is subject to change but let's talk about everything we know so far unlike auction vex has a surprisingly small amount of text in her ability description for a champion released in season 11. but looking at gwen you don't need a lot of words to be a strong champion now let's jump into her kit vex's passive is called doom and glow the first part doom periodically empowers vex's basic abilities to interrupt dashes and fear enemies the second part of her passive gloom marks enemies that use a dash or blink with gloom vex's next basic attack against a marked enemy detonates the mark dealing bonus damage and refunding a part of doom's cooldown this passive is a core part of vex's identity being able to interrupt dashes and fear enemies with a basic ability is really powerful especially since it gives you cc on any of your other skills when vex is glowing green you better be careful the second part literally just gives you free damage and depending on the numbers and cooldown reduction vex might get her enhanced abilities very quickly if she's facing someone mobile like irelia or even yasuo before we talk about the rest
called mistral bolt she launches a wave forward dealing magic damage to enemies it passes through after a short delay the wave accelerates but has a reduced width mistral bull also detonates gloom on any marked enemies that it hits like most champions vex's q will be her bread and butter ability the speed and timing is really interesting and it'll probably surprise players during the first few weeks of release because her q can proc the extra damage from her passive it's crucial that you land this on as many people as possible so you aren't overlapping your glue marks moving on to vex's w personal space this ability is really good on a squishy mage when used vex gains a shield and emits a shock wave dealing magic damage to enemies around her personal space also detonates gloom on any marked champions this w is a really solid ability for peeling both herself and her teeth because her doom passive recharges over time in the mid and late game vex will almost always have her fear up just in case she gets caught out having an instant fear and shield is great on any champion and being able to proc her gloom mark makes a simple ability even more powerful alright let's talk about her e looming darkness vex says shadow flies to a location increasing in size as it travels on arriving shadow deals magic damage slows and marks enemies hit with gloom i'd say another normal looking ability something important to note here is that vex's e actually applies a mark of gloom instead of consuming it if you want to maximize your damage it's crucial that you don't overlap your marks luckily this ability has a pretty decent travel time so you should be able to weave in an auto attack to trigger your gloom before applying it again now let's talk about everyone's favorite part the ultimate vex's r is called shadow surge shadows fly forward marking and dealing magic damage to the first enemy champion hit vex can then recast his abilities have shadow pull her to the marked target dealing additional magic damage if the marked target dies within a short time of taking damage from shadow surge vex can cast shadow surge again within a few seconds on paper this ability reminds me of an ultimate version of the snowball from aram one important thing to know is that you can only get the reset if you kill an enemy shortly after they take damage from the ultimate if you get a random assist while your else is on cooldown it won't reset my favorite part about this ability that works really well with the rest of vex's kit you can jump in on any champion that needs to w for a huge aoe fear or you can try to wait until you see an enemy get low to chase down the kill speaking of vex's kit let's talk about our first impressions vex is a breath of fresh air in terms of both champion design and abilities she's the first female yordle we've gotten in almost 10 years and her abilities aren't walls of text either the cool thing about vex is that unless her numbers are just insane her power will change depending on the enemy team if the enemy team has no dashes or blinks you actually lose a pretty big chunk of your damage because you won't get a lot of glue marks less glue marks mean you won't be able to reduce the cooldown of your fear which will leave you dealing less damage and having less cc but honestly i think that's totally fine vex's e still applies gloom and let's be honest i can't name the last game of league of legends that didn't have a champion with a dash even if the enemy has 5 champions with dashes maximizing your damage is going to be a lot of work juggling your empowered auto attacks with your q and w will give vex a ton of damage if done correctly so let's see what the best players can come up with and that's everything we've got

"over the past few years I've created several online businesses that generated multiple six figures in profit each and today I'll be spilling all my secrets I'll be sharing how to start a profitable online business from scratch from choosing a product to branding to advertising to put it to the test I'll be creating a brand new business alongside you step by step and I'll even share with you some AI tools to make things easier step one product what product should I sell this is often the first question new entrepreneurs focus on the problem is that's what causes most of them to fail all that you've been told is wrong your first question shouldn't be what product should I sell your first question should be what problem can I solve it doesn't matter how cool or fancy your product is if it doesn't solve a real problem that people care about it's not going to sell well there are four ways to find a problem to start a business around the first way is through yourself start by examining your own life and interest what problems have you faced what skills do you have that you could help others with the second way is through chat GPT you can ask it for a list of problems to start a business around and it'll actually generate some good ideas you can then keep asking is to dive deeper and deeper into specific categories to find problems that you're interested in tackling the Third Way is through Target markets AKA A specific group of people out there that you could sell to for example people who go to the gym think about what they're struggling with and what you could solve for them you can use chat gbt to come up with Target markets and list out their problems if you feel your target market is too broad and diverse keep niching down on their demographics and interests instead of all gym goers what about women aged 18 or 24 or people who practice yoga or people who work out at the playground get specific and specific problems will come up the fourth way is through existing businesses and products you can gain inspiration from the problems they're trying to solve you can find ideas on Google YouTube and Tick Tock where a good hashtag you could search is hashtag Tick Tock made me buy if you're thinking of Drop Shipping or working with a manufacturer you can browse Alibaba and AliExpress and find products there you can also explore services and digital products remember focus on the problem not the product it's the easiest way to tell if something will sell or not once you land on a real problem you can then decide on a product you can sell to solve it for the business we're creating together I was browsing Alibaba and saw this electric pot and it sparked a real problem that I had in University back in first year I always wanted to eat late in the evening after a long day of studying the problem was my small dorm had no kitchen appliances and my residence dining hall always closed early the food there wasn't that great either and it was expensive so I always wish there was a way to cook in my dorm this electric pot would have solved all my problems I could cook at any time I could cook noodles eggs Lobster I like this this has potential with the problem and a product we can now go to step two target market it's now time to figure out who has your problem that's willing to purchase your product you may already have an idea but sometimes a problem and product can be shared by a lot of different people in which you're going to want to Niche down on a smaller target market so you can stand out in the case of our electric pot this product could be handy for a range of people Travelers campers office workers but instead of selling to all of them I'm gonna Niche down to that Target Market related to my original problem University students who live in dorms without kitchen appliances now how do you determine if a target market is a good one to sell to or not it comes down to three factors one market size how big is this group of people it shouldn't be too big where it includes everyone but it shouldn't be too small either there are a lot of University students out there living in dorms so for our electric pot I think we have a pretty good Market size typically the bigger the market the more money there is on the table however it usually brings along more competition which is the second Factor how many competitors are out there selling your product to the same target market are they established and professional if there's a lot it's going to be harder for you to stand out and sell while there are a lot of electric pot Brands out there I don't find many of them specifically marketing towards University students the third factor is profitability is this target market actually willing to spend their hard-earned dough on your product and if so how much profit is there to be earned note that a small Market size or high competition doesn't always mean it's not profitable maybe each person has a lot of money to spend or there's so much demand that it doesn't even matter if if there are a lot of competitors it really depends profitability wise for the electric pot it's decent University students are typically broke but being that this product is genuinely useful and can save the money it could sell well if the pricing is Right parents may also see the benefit of this product and buy it for their children for help you can ask chatgpt to weigh the pros and cons of a certain target market most new entrepreneurs and really all entrepreneurs will likely keep going back and forth between step one and step two for a while deciding on a product and a target market while it is important don't get stuck here for too long most of the time you actually have to start the business first to get the answers it's always better to start with an imperfect product and target market and change things later on versus never starting at all let's now move on to step three platform you're building an online business so of course you'll be selling your product online but where online will it be through a Marketplace like Amazon eBay or Etsy these platforms come with an existing customer base that can help bring traffic to your product but they come with fees competition next to your listing and limited customization for your brand the the other type of platform would be your own website it gives you complete control over your branding has fewer fees and can really make your business look legit however you need to build the website and you have to drive traffic to it through marketing the best type of platform to choose will really depend on your product and the way you're going to advertise it which we'll get into later what I will say is that you can never go wrong with having your own website let's begin by grabbing a domain name I was thinking we name our product dormpot you know a pot for dorms simple straightforward catchy let's try for dormpot.com and nope it's taken who even has it this website is literally a blank page come on finding a good.com domain name these days has just gone hard instead I think I'm gonna go with a domain that's been trending on the online streets dot store dot store is a domain meant exclusively for online stores it tells people your website is a store and instantly Associates it with selling it has over 1 million businesses celebrities and influencers using it including Rihanna Maroon 5 Discord favorite Castel Dude Perfect Zach King and Cristiano Ronaldo it's been found that almost 70 percent of domain name availability checks on.com fail but with DOT store there is a huge pool of good and short domain names available which means you don't need to compromise let's check if dormplot.store is available and it is oh it's got a ring to it you can buy Dot store domain at any registrar like GoDaddy or namecheap or a website builder like Shopify or Wix or being
our website there are plenty of e-commerce website Builders out there like Shopify Wix and Squarespace they all have their pros and cons so feel free to choose one that fits your needs the best for dornpot I'll be using Wix now I won't be diving too much into the details of creating an e-commerce website in this video if you want to learn more you can check out my detailed video tutorial here the gist is to make sure the website looks good and professional don't have it looking like a scam okay take inspiration from other websites and keep things minimal and streamlined you don't need too much on there just words and media to help you sell your product and showcase step four branding having a strong brand is essential to connecting with customers a brand is what separates a business from some dude selling random things online a blank website is a great canvas to start building your brand off of because it's very visual when designing a website you can build your brand along with it there are four branding elements you need to determine before launching your business starting with your name my recommendation is to keep it simple something that isn't confusing and can be searched easily especially as an online business people are going to type your name with dormpot it's kind of basic but it instantly gets the project across and works great online if someone searches for an electric pot for dorms they'll likely come across dorm pod next your logo your logo should give off the personality of your company again keep it simple it can be an image but it can also just be text if you want a quick way to create a logo you can use AI art generators like mid-journey or Leonardo to generate one for you and boom that looks good next up visual identity this refers to everything else that's visual your Brand's color palette font imagery the looking packaging of your product all this is going to influence how people will perceive your business everything should be catered towards your target market for dormplot we definitely want to have a young casual University feel to it since we're targeting University students so I'm going to use a range of colors modern fonts and fun imagery and lastly messaging this is probably the most critical and most overlooked part of a brand what it says to its target market people resonate with businesses that solve their

promotion this step will decide whether your business will live or die if you can stick through and figure out a way to successfully Market your business you win there are many different marketing channels to choose from to promote your online business paid ads search engine optimization email marketing affiliate marketing the list goes on while your business should eventually grow to utilize several channels the one I recommend you go all in on at the start is social media marketing right now the best way to promote your business is through short form content tick tocks Instagram reels YouTube shorts the algorithm is boosting those right now and it's just so much easier to grab eyeballs through them versus traditional YouTube videos or Instagram posts for example with dormpot what I do to promote it would be to make videos like this guy this guy just Cooks all kinds of food with his electric pot on his college bed and it's genius it's weird and engaging it's very authentic and it demonstrates the product perfectly where people are begging to buy the electric pot and that's the thing this guy is selling the electric pot through his website in his bio that was his plan all along that's how you do it some products are naturally visual like the dorm pot but some aren't so you'll have to get creative once you get the hang of social media marketing you can then consider other marketing channels like paid ads most of the time people just jump straight into paid ads when they don't even know how to craft a good social media post you're basically throwing money away at that point after going to Market and hopefully getting some sales it's finally time for step six adjust and iterate you're likely not going to get everything right on your first try maybe the problem you chose wasn't actually that big of a problem maybe you're focusing on the wrong target market maybe Tick Tock isn't actually the best way to promote your product expect to fail and expect to change things if you keep working on this steps I mentioned I can almost promise you that you will eventually land on a profitable online business and there you have it I wish you the best of luck with your business if you want to see me start a real business from scratch using these exact same steps be sure to like this video subscribe if you haven't already and peace out",non-well-being
"When it comes to making money online, it seems like there are so many people giving false information and scams out there. So in today's video, I'm going to share with you some real credible information on the best online businesses to start as an absolute beginner. Now in this video, I'm going to share with you three very specific online business models. The first one is going to be the very easiest one. So if you have no skills and you want to start something today that's actually going to work. This is the business model for you. The second online business in this video, again, is going to be a very easy one that you can start today. And then the third one has the potential to make you the most money the fastest. Now, for all three of these online businesses, I have made full step-by-step tutorials, totally for free on my YouTube channel. This is typically the part that most people miss. They tell you about a business idea, but they don't teach you how to do it unless you pay for the course or something like that. So guys, just before we jump into this video, I do wanna just take one quick second to give you some credibility about myself. If you are anything like me, whenever I'm getting financial advice or business advice from someone, I need to see the proof before I'm taking any of their advice to heart. So I've personally done all three of these business models and over the years of doing them, I've made something like $3 million in profit. These business models absolutely work. I've been in the trenches learning them inside and out. And in the videos on my channel, you will see exactly what I've done to get to my level of profit. So you can do it as well. Alright guys, without further ado, let's get straight into the first one here. And all I ask is if you do find yourself enjoying this video as you're watching it, please just give it a thumbs up and let me know down in the comments. Okay? So starting with the very first business model, like I said, this is the easiest one that anyone can start today. Let me switch you over to the computer and show you this one. So what this one is is Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing. Now, you may have seen this called Amazon KDP, and essentially what this is is where you can create books and sell them on Amazon. Now, I don't want you to think that you have to write full books for this. You can actually create daily planners or blank journals, all different types of books, and you can sell those on Amazon with KDP. So I'll put up a really big list here of different ideas that you can create KDP books with, and then I'll show you some real examples in my hand. So hopefully this list gives you some brainstorming ideas of different types of books you can create. But here are some real examples. So this is a password logbook. Every page in here is the same and it's just formatted to keep track of your passwords. Another example here is just a journal with blank pages where people can keep notes, but it has a funny cover on it. And then some of my favorites here, these are word search books. So if you know how to create word searches, which in the free tutorial I was talking about on this channel, it'll show you exactly how to do that. You can create books like this where they are themed word searches and sell those on Amazon. Now the thing that I love so much about this business model is all we have to do is create this actual arc file on our computer front and back for the covers, and then what's going to be on each page. And if you have the right software, you can create all this so easily and you upload those files to Amazon and then that creates a virtual listing of this product. And when someone purchases it, Amazon actually prints this physical book and ships it out to the customer. We don't have to print anything, we don't even take care of customer service. It's all done on Amazon. So let me quickly switch you over to the computer and show a real example of this. On Amazon, if you type in word search books, which is ones that I was just showing you here, this is going to be all results. And for the vast majority of these, they're going to be done with Amazon KDP. So if you click on one of these listings, which just looks like a normal Amazon listing, this is actually done with KDP. So the person who is selling this only created this front cover here, the back cover, and then you don't even see what is inside. Besides that it has 131 pages, but when someone purchases this, Amazon will print it and ship it out to them and they will receive something like this. So guys, as a total beginner, if you know how to create these covers and what's inside of the books, which I show you totally for free in that tutorial, you can come up with so many different ideas to create these word searches or any other types of journals that you want to create, and you can upload them directly to Amazon. Now, there is so much more that I'd like to talk about for this business model, but I really wanna keep this video moving along. Trust me when I say there are very few business models out there besides the ones on this list that you can start for very low risk. You don't have to spend any money on advertising or marketing, and you can start making money within the first month that you start. So guys, if you do want to start Amazon KDP, there's a full step-by-step tutorial linked down in the description. However, let's get into the second business model. Alright, so moving into the second online business that I highly recommend. This one is slightly harder to do than Amazon KDP, but it is still definitely classified as one that is easy to start. What this business is called is called Print on Demand. Now, if you haven't heard of Print on Demand before, it is very similar to Amazon KDP, but instead of creating books, you're creating t-shirts. Now, if this is a business model that I have a ton of experience with, I've literally been doing this one for just about 10 years now. This is a business model that has proven time and time again to work. So let me quickly switch you over to the computer and show you a real example of this just to tie it all together. So if we come back over to Amazon, again, this is just going to be the largest Print on Demand marketplace out there, but there are several other Print on Demand marketplaces you can sell on as well. With that being said, if you type in something like funny fishing shirt just as just for an example, you can type in any type of t-shirt and you scroll down here, you're going to see these kind of funny graphic t-shirts. Now for all of these that have the same mockup, so you'll notice this kind of black or it could be a different color t-shirt mockup that looked the same. So this one and this one, if you keep scrolling down here, you're going to see the same mockup, the same mockup. These are all being done with Print on Demand. So if we just click on one of these, again, just like Amazon KDP, the person who created this only uploaded this design here, and then Amazon created this listing. Whenever someone places an order, Amazon will print it and ship it out to the customer and take care of all the customer service for you. Now, what's cool is as you're looking around Amazon just doing some research on this, anytime you see this little label right here, Amazon Merch on Demand, that means that this listing is being done with Print on Demand. So just like Amazon KDP, you set your pricing so you get to determine how much money you make per sale, and then anyone can come in here, they can choose what kind of shirt they want that printed on, what color, what size, and they can add it right to their cart and they can purchase it even with Amazon Prime Shipping. Now a couple really important things about Print on Demand. First, I would say that it is very similar to Amazon KDP. The only main difference is that in order to be a seller for Amazon Print on Demand, you have to actually apply to be a seller. So if you go over to Google, you type in Amazon Merch on Demand, it'll bring you to this page, and this is where you actually sign up to be a Print on Demand seller on Amazon. So once you see this sign up button, you just click on that, it goes through a very quick application and then you have to wait up to 14 days to hear back from Amazon to see if you are approved or not. Now the bit of good news here is that while you're waiting from Amazon to hear back, there are a couple other big Print on Demand marketplaces that you can also sell your designs on, and you can start on those right away. You don't have to apply to be a seller. Now those websites and how to apply to Amazon, all the information for Print on Demand business is going to be in a full print on demand tutorial linked down in the description as well. That is going to be totally free here on the YouTube channel. Now with that being said, I would say the number one issue or obstacle people run into when starting Print on Demand is how to actually create designs if you don't have graphic design experience. So this is something that I've learned over the years of doing this, but there are graphic design tools out there where you can type in something like fishing. Let's create a fishing t-shirt. You give that a search and you have all of these different t-shirt templates that you can then start customizing and you can use those for your print on demand designs. Just to give you a little glimpse into this, you can come in here and change all the text. And the best part is you can come in here and change",non-well-being
"they're the type of fruit that just give and give and give and what do i mean by that well there's so many applications that stem from a coconut you can extract the coconut water and from the meat you can make your own coconut milk or coconut oil and you can also dehydrate the coconut meat and keep it for pretty much six months to one year and after you break down this coconut you're gonna be left with a souvenir for years to come so without further ado let's get into the kitchen and i'm going to show you how to break down this coconut and don't worry we're not going to need any hammers or screwdrivers for this one all right so here is our coconut and each coconut is going to have these germination holes and there's always going to be three of them and this is where we're going to extract our coconut water from so the tool i'm going gonna be using to extract the coconut water is this corkscrew right here and i'm gonna insert my corkscrew into one of the holes and with each coconut there's always gonna be one of the holes that are a lot softer than the other two so you're gonna have to kind of test them out [Music] so to ensure my coconut water comes out nice and clean i'm gonna add a sieve on top of my glass before pouring my coconut water in and depending on the hole you made and the coconut sometimes it'll come out in these small drips and sometimes it'll come out in a nice thin stream [Music] and here is our much needed vacation in a glass [Music] [Music] all right moving on to opening up our coconut so we're gonna use the spine of our knife we're not gonna use the blade no no no that is dangerous we're gonna use the spine and we're gonna focus around the equator of our coconut and we're gonna pivot our body so we don't hit ourselves with that knife we just want to hammer that coconut with the spine of our knife and we're just gonna keep using the spine of our knife to hammer that coconut's equator and as you can see there's a crack forming once you've made that crack all the way through it'll just open like so and next i'm going to show you how to remove the meat from this coconut so just put it onto a tray and we're going to bake this at 400 degrees for 15 minutes [Music] and once you remove it from the oven just place it down on your cutting board and let it cool for about five minutes and you're going to take a butter knife or paring knife and you're going to put it in between the shell and the meat of the coconut and we want to kind of pry it out so you're just going to insert it in between and turn your knife until it just kind of pops out and then we'll do that with the second half of the coconut [Music] and then you're gonna be left with these two coconut shells and these make for some really cool serving bowls next we're going to take a peeler and we're just going to remove that thin layer of brown coconut skin

Hi. So I'm just going to talk to you about card games and playing different card games. Specifically the 2 that I know very well and play a lot are Romy and poker. So So let's start with the card deck. So there's 52 cards in a card deck. Each one is unique. So there's 4 different suits in a card deck, which means that, per suit, there is 14 cards. I'm pretty sure. So that starts with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, queen, king, and ace. Okay. It's 13, actually. The 4 different suits are, there's the clover, there is diamond, there's hearts. And then there is, I forgot the last one. Wait a second. The last one is Spades. So there's spades, clubs, hearts, and diamonds in, a card deck. So for poker and rummy, usually you need 2 card deck, which means there's a 104 cards. Let's start with poker. So poker, you play with chips, which equal to money and poker is usually a gambling game. I don't use it to gamble. I use it to play with my friends. We usually don't play with money, which we just use the chips for fun. Like, Oh, whoever wins is just mostly for the ego boost. So the point in poker is to try to get the best hand. A hand is made out of 5 cards. Overall, you can see 7 cards. So your hand should be made up the out of the 5 best cards. So it starts with the dealer. He mixes the cards very shuffles the cards very well and deals everyone 2 cards. So then you have 2 cards on your deck. You will look at those cards and you think, oh, are they good? A good card would, for example, be a high card because high cards are always beat a lower card. So an ace is always gonna beat a king, a queen, a jack, 10, and anything below. So it's always good to have a higher card. And then if you have the same suit, same suit is also good because that could mean you could perhaps get a flush. For example, having 2 diamonds would be good. The best of course would be having, oh, I actually forgot. You don't play with 2 decks. That's only Romeo and poker. You only play with 1 deck. So that's 52 cards. So there's 4 of each card. There's 4 sevens, 4 eights, 4 nines, 4 kings, 4 queens, 4 jacks, which is very important for you to predict what other players could have. Because the game is all about bluffing and predicting. So you put so once you look at your 2 cards, you could either put unless you're the big or small blind. Big or small blind always have to put, but let's not talk about that. So if you see your cards and you think they're good, for example, you have a king and an ace, doesn't matter, suit, those are good cards. So if you, have a pair of that, you could win, but you can only have pairs in the next round. So once people say whether they're gonna go with a round or not, so putting chips or not, people could raise. So for example, if you have 2 aces, you'd be like, oh, well I think I have the best card. So I definitely think I'm gonna win. Let me put in more money. And then people are gonna look at their cards again and think, oh no, that's I don't have good enough cards. She probably has better cards. I should not go. Or you think, oh no, my cards are good. I think I have better cards than her. So you always only gonna go unless when you, if you think you have better cards than the person next to you or the person at the table or you're bluffing. So that's another big thing in poker. People always bluff because you don't know the cards of others players. You never know when they're bluffing or not. So unless you have the best cards, there's always a chance they could have better cards. So then if they put them more and be like, oh no, my cards are not that good. Let me not go. But then when we get to the next round, the dealer puts down 3 other cards. So now you could create actual hands. So for example, if there's a king and you have a king, you have a pair. So if no one else has a pair, you you won. You have the best. Or if there's 2 kings and you have a king, that's 3 of a kind. So it's it goes from high card to pair to, I think, 2 pairs and then 3 of a kind and then straight. And then so straight would be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, but the better straight, the better. So if you have a 2, 3, 4, 5, and then they have a 3, 4, 5, 6, they won, rather than you. So you have 3 cards and you, on the table and 2 and you can think, oh, I think that's good. But the end, there's gonna be 5 cards on the table. So out of those 5 cards and your cards, whoever has the best combination wins. So then let's say you see a king, you have a king. I don't think anyone has been any better. You again, raise and put more money in. And then people again will will say, no, I'm not going or I am going, and this continues. Yeah. And then there's another card, put down and again, you see, oh, I think I better have not in the last card. And it's always about putting in money, calling, which is when someone puts the money and then you put that in the same money checking when no one puts the money and everyone checks just to see the next card or raising. And that was not a great explanation actually, but it's the best I can do right now. ",non-well-being
"Hi. So I wanna explain, the rules of chess. So in chess, there are the white and the black pieces. Each piece each, color has the same amount of pieces, but your opposing team. So chess can only be played by 2 players on a chess board. The oh. So the chess board, is made out of 64 squares which is 8 rows by 8 columns which means that there are 16 pieces per team. So the pieces are made up of first 8, 8 pawns. So the pawns kind of when when you start on your 8 by 8 board, so it's also there's like notation of chess. So there's like a, b, c, d, e, f, g, b, c, h, and then there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So when you're moving a piece if you want to write it down you go like 2, b2 or g3 to note where you're moving your piece. So yeah when you start there's you your pieces are taking up the first two and the last two rows of the chessboard. White o is always the first two and white also always starts. So this means that the the pawns, they're on the second row, so they're on 2 a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and the black pieces are on 7 a, b, c, d, e, f, g. Yeah. Exactly. And then so this means that when you are, playing, you move your pieces based on that. So you need to first move your pawns to be able to move any other piece other than the, knight because the knight can jump over pieces. Every other piece moves linear, so they if something's blocking it, it can't move past it. But the pawns can only move one step at a time, except at their first step. The first step, they can move 2 steps at the time if they wanted to. Then the other pieces are the king. So the king is basically what you need to protect. So if your king gets checkmated, so that's when 2 other pieces could, could kill it, that means checkmate. Then your queen, your queen is your most powerful piece, so you also need to protect it a lot because your queen can move however many steps at once forwards, left, right, and diagonally. However, you can only move once per turn. And the pawn, it sorry. Going back to the pawn, the pawn takes diagonally. The queen can take however it want wants. Then there's the bishops. They only move diagonally, and they take diagonally. The knight, which move in kind of an l, which means they go forward 3 and then, no forward 2 and then to the right one, or left one, or they can go like back to so yeah. Like yeah. So just left so northeast, southwest, 2, and then, from that, northeast, southwest, 1. So kind of just an l shape in whatever whichever direction they want. And then there is the rook which is also quite a powerful piece and it can move forward backwards left and right giving it a lot of domination over the board. However, it is tucked in in a corner so it's hard to get it out in 1st place. Some other things that you need to note is that you can castle, which means moving the if you have your bishop and your knight out of the way, you can move your king and rook and kind of swap positions of them, which is, quite interesting and can be quite good when using it when playing. And then overall, it's just taking of the pieces of the other player and then making sure to protect your own. So never leaving your piece to be able to be taken without some way to take it back, to take that piece back. Also, there, each piece is given a, a value. So with the pawns being least valuable to the queen, and the king being the the king, I mean, doesn't really have a value because if it's gone, you're gone to the queen being the most. So you would never let someone take your queen to only take their pawn. You'd wanna take something worth the same value, which with queen is hard. So rook has after the queen the most value at 5, and bishops and knights are 3, and pawn is 1, and I think the queen is 8. So yeah that's a horrible explanation by me of chess but that's just all the beginner stuff you need to know.",non-well-being
"Hey, so today I'm going to talk about a new project that I'm doing. So basically I'm just trying to create like some stamps curving the linoleum and then I'm just going to put the stumps on maybe some clothes. Or some bags or whatever, and then I can have like my own, like my personal design. And yeah, and that's something that I'm that I'm working on right now. So basically I can just show you the the stamps that I made so far and talk about it a bit more. So you can understand. So the first one that I have here is this small star that I made. It's one of the first stamps that. That I ever made. So as you can see, it's not great. It's not the best. I think I'm just gonna make a new one because this one is a bit like rough and and and not really precisely done. UM, the other thing that I have here is a small alien and a smile. Those are a bit better. I haven't tried them with paint yet, so it's hard to say if if it's actually OK, but it looks fine to me now, but I will try that later today. The other one. Also, a new one is this small snake that I'm just gonna use for some like background in my design. I also haven't tried this one yet. But we'll see. The next one is this skeleton with the flower instead of a head. I haven't finished this one yet. As you can see, the background is still yet to be curved, but it looks fine. I think it's like one of the biggest pieces that I've made. So far, so I'm really excited because that would be like a centerpiece of some of my designs. The next one it's also, I mean it's this big Scorpio, it's also one of the fairest of my designs and it's with with a different kind of linoleum and  it's way softer and easier to work with. So it was, it was really  enjoyable. To work with this, but I can't find this linoleum anymore. And now I'm working with this, way, way harder one. But yeah, the next one is this small spider. So it's it's I think that's like my newest piece probably. And it's also I haven't tried this one yet, so we'll see how it goes. Next I have this small bouquet of flowers. I've tried this one. I mean it's really small, but you know, just to put it in the background or something, I think it should. Fine. And this one is also one of the first pieces. It's also with the softer linoleum. I've tried this one, but it used to be with the background and now I removed everything, so it's just the flower and I haven't tried it with. Like without the background, so we'll. See here I have this small cloud, but honestly I don't really like it. I could work on the inside a bit more. I feel like because it's it's very simple but it's. I don't know. I don't really like it. And then I have this small tree here also just to add something in the background. But it's really nice. Then I have this mushroom that I actually really enjoyed doing for some reason, and it turned out really well, so that's nice. And here I have all of the letters. I made the whole alphabet. And then I think I'm just going to put some text on the design and then you know the the symbols around it, I'm just going to arrange it somehow and hopefully it's gonna look nice, but I haven't tried it on clothes yet, just on paper, because I still need to work on it, I mean, I. Still need to figure out what kind of paint I want to use because the one that I have now is acrylic and it's a bit too. I don't know, like too watery or something it just doesn't really work well, but we'll see about that. ",non-well-being

okay so um today im gonna give you my honest review on a book that ive read recently and um really liked actually. so it's it's called men without women and its written by one of my favourite writers ever em haruki marukami. and i really liked this book because its like a compilation of a bunch of um short stories all put together. and um it's really interesting because basically the stories show the perspective of men when they are dealing with women basically. so it just highlightes mens feelings when dealing with breakups or jealousy or just simply falling in love. and i really liked it honestly because basically its just a book about love and relationships and i could reate to some of the stories a lot. but also i feel like men's perspective is not often wrote about in books and since they never want to talk about their feelings well maybe some of them do but whatever. it was just very interesting and also very nicely written. with a lot of humour and overall i just enjoyed reading it. and also the format is really nice because the stories are quite short and um i could just read one at work or something and its not like i just stopped reading in the middle of the story. so yeah well thank you for listening and um i will talk to you some other time. bye.,non-well-being
"So jujutsu kaisen, it's a very famous manga and anime show that you've probably heard about. But what is it about? So it follows, the main character called Itadori. And he goes to school and he's just doing the normal school stuff when all of a sudden he meets a guy in the hallway. But before that he runs an occult club with 2 of his friends. So them 3, they think there's something mysterious going on their school, so they run-in a cult club to try to figure this out. However, the story kind of starts because it's a comedy slash action slash horror, and it starts out with him with his PE teacher saying no you cannot join the occult club because you're so fast and so strong you have to join the fitness club. And then Itadori says but what if I throw this shot put like 50 meters? Can I then join the occult club? And the teacher says of course because no one can do it. So it starts with Itadori showing this massive strength and throwing it 50 meters. Then after one day after the occult club, Itadori meets Megumi, another one of the main characters in the hallway. Megumi is a sorcerer, a jujutsu sorcerer, and he fights demons. Megumi saves Itadori from a demon. So Itadori is like wow this is really interesting because Itadori is very much the type of person main character. He's very naive. He likes to get into everyone's business. He likes action. He's sporty. He always wants to be part of everything. So he gets involved and he fights this demon. However, they when they fought fight this demon, the demon, he he uncovers a finger which sounds a bit weird. It's a it's a dead finger and for some reason, Itadori has an urge to eat it and he does. And when he eats this, he turns into a demon, which is the strongest demon to have ever existed, our strongest curse to have ever existed called Sukuna and he turns into him and he has to fight Megumi. Then the strongest sorcerer, Jisoo sorcerer comes and saves a day Gojo who has an ability called unlimited, which means the closer you get to his body, the more your hand slows down to infinity so that you can never actually touch him, which of course is a really crazy ability to have. He is also very pretty and which makes him another reason why he's a main character as he has very blue eyes which is shown in the manga and anime a lot. Overall, he fights Sukuna and manages to take make him turn back into Itadori. The rest of the, series then goes on about how Itadori, because he's taken in this, finger, he now is able to see curses. So he trains to become a sorcerer to help fight these curses. And usually a person, if they eat one of Sukuna's fingers, they just die or they can't digest overall. But he could, showing how strong he is. So now his job is to eat all the fingers of Sukuna so that all his power is taken into Itadori's body and then he must die. So that Sukuna is finally killed off because he's such a horror to the world and keeps on creating messes. At some point however, another curse or really evil jujitsu sorcerer comes back alive and creates a plot to kill all humanity which of course throws everything off course, throws off the plan to fight Sukuna and everything just turns into a mess. There's also so there's 3 main characters Itadori, Megumi, and Nagura who are 3 of the students, at the jujutsu Sorcerer Academy in Japan. The whole story is in Japan.",non-well-being
"So Harry Potter, what is it? So it's a massive movie franchise which is based on a book series by JK Rowling. So in this universe it is set in the in the world as we know it on earth in an urban setting. And it's the same as as we know it except there are magical folk called wizards and witches who can do curses and spells. So yeah, as you know a witch, that's them. It follows the main person called Harry Potter, who is he's born a wizard but he doesn't know it. So his parents die when he's very young and he's raised by his aunt and uncle who hate wizards because his aunt and uncle are from his mom's side. The mom was born to to muggles which is the term in the books and movies for non wizarding people. She was born to to muggles which does happen. It's not as common though. And her sister was always very jealous of this because obviously because of that she got a lot more attention than she did. So when Harry Potter's parents died he went to live with the Dursleys, his aunt and uncle, and they never told him that he was a wizard. He was also treated very badly. He had to live in a cupboard under the stairs. But when he turned 11 he got a letter from Hogwarts, which is the wizarding school in the UK, that he can go there, which was a very new thing to Harry. He was very excited. Anyways throughout the movie and book franchises it takes you on the adventures of Harry Potter. His arch and nemesis Voldemort, which has been the evil person for many years. He was the one who killed his parents. His parents were warring against him too. And what he puts Harry under, like mental conflict. He makes two friends. Hermione Granger who she's also both her parents are also non wizarding folkmuggles and Ronald Weasley who his parents are all wizards for a very long time. They're all redheads. Very large family is like six 6 siblings. And then 3, they're quite a trio. They're very fun to follow. The first couple are definitely made for children as the main characters are also children in the movie. There are 11 So there's 7 books and movies which follow the children through their 7 years in school until they graduate. So as the movies, the later on the movies, the more intense the movies get, the more violent there is and I think it's less focused towards children. However it's overall still a very interesting storyline whether you are an adult or child. For example, in the first book what happens is Harry gets to the school and there's a plot to steal the philosopher's stone which is a stone that makes you immortal. So him, Hermione and Ron, which are his 2 best friends, have to solve who is even doing it and how to stop him. In the second movie it's about the chamber of secrets which is a chamber hidden underneath Hogwarts. That's no no one knows where it is and that's been opened. And in this chamber is a massive snake that kills people. And the 3rd movie is about werewolves. So a new professor gets there and he's actually a werewolf. So it's kind of about that. I don't want to spoil too much. In the 4th movie, it's about the tri wizard cup. So there's there's, a competition between 3 schools and 3 people compete in there, three of the students, usually you'd have to be 17. And there's you can't get in unless you're 17 but somehow Harry who's 14 at the time his name gets drawn. And yes it completes some very very cool challenges. The 5th book is actually about a teacher who comes from a ministry of magic who's a bit of an evil teacher. And the ministry of magic thinks the ministry of magic is like the government, so it rules the wizards. They think that Dumbledore who's the headmaster also a very prominent figure in the books and movies is not a good headmaster anymore and because all the witches and wizards from the UK go to the school he has to be very good because they're the new generation. So he's a very important figure. So they sent him a person from the Ministry of Magic to, yeah make sure that what he's doing is okay and that's just to control him. But through doing this, she turns the school into a horrible mess and everyone hates her. I won't tell you about the other books to come, but overall, it's a movie to check out.",non-well-being
